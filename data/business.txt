just before he inherited millions.as much as she loved him,he dumped her.Cord's mother Maria was thrilleduntil they hooked up again.So Maria hired Max Holden to romance Tinaflew to Argentina with Max.Cord finally figured out what was going onTina had already been kidnapped,She and her baby were presumed dead.Cord was sad for a bit,but then he bounced right backand they had a gorgeous wedding"Stop!" she screamed."Am I too late?Cord, I've come so far.This is your son."And that, ladies and gentlemen,that lasted 25 years.(Laughter)Now, if you've ever seen a soap opera,and if you're not,Maybe you think watching soap operasis a waste of time,But I believe the opposite to be true.Soap operas reflect life, just bigger.as any soap opera storyline.(Applause)My job was watching soap operas,reading soap opera scriptsSo I know my stuff.(Laughter)And yes, soap operasare larger than life,drama on a grand scale,and the stakes can feel just as dramatic.We cycle through tragedy and joyjust like these characters.and we do it again and again and again,that move like bumblebees,looping and swerving through life.And we can use those lessonsto craft our own life stories.Soap operas teach us to push away doubtand believe in our capacityfor bravery, vulnerability,adaptability and resilience.And most importantly, they show usit's never too late to change your story.surrender is not an option.(Laughter)a hyperbolically self-important princesswho deep down was scrappy and daring.is her alone in the woodssuddenly face to face with a grizzly bear.She screamed at the bear,"You may not do this!Do you understand me?You may not come near me!I am Erica Kaneand you are a filthy beast!"(Laughter)And of course the bear left,so what that teaches usis obstacles are to be expectedwith two million dollars in funding.They were out of cash the next year.and it still wasn't enough.and it worked.and now, more than a decade later,Pandora is worth billions.When you believe that there is a waythat surrender is not an option,you can overcome enormous obstacles.Which brings us to soap opera lesson two:Now, this is scary.Maybe it's even an admissionthought she was pretty darn special.She thought she was so special,Stephanie got sick and let Brooke in.They made amends,archenemies became soul matesand Stephanie died in Brooke's arms,and here's our takeaway.Drop your ego.Life is not about you.It's about us,and our ability to experience joyand love and to improve our realityand our inactions,Now, after a great run as CEO,Howard stepped down in 2000,and Starbucks quickly overextended itselfand stock prices fell.Howard rejoined the team in 2008,and one of the first things he didwas apologize to all 180,000 employees.He apologized.And now, Starbucks has more than doubledits net revenue since Howard came back.It's not helping anyone, least of all you.Sacrifice your ego.Soap opera lesson three:evolution is real.You're not meant to be static characters.Now, on TV, those dynamic changescan make for some rough transitions,and played by someone new today.Recasting happens all the time on soaps.Over the last 20 years,of Carly Benson on "General Hospital."And here's what that means for us.we can evolve too.or we can open ourselves to opportunitiesor like Julia Child.Julia was a World War II spy,to evolve and adapt.We make the choice,Surprise slams us in the face.and you need resuscitation.resurrection is possible.(Laughter)(Applause)but not really, because in 1984(Laughter)But before the tumor could kill him,And so it went for 30 years.(Laughter)Even when we saw the body,we knew better.He's called the Phoenix for a reason.And here's what that means for us.As long as the show is still on the air,or you're still breathing,nothing is permanent.Resurrection is possible.Now, of course, just like life,and we shot our final episodein June 2010.It was six months of dyingI somehow thought everything would be OK.and we moved in with my in-lawsin Alabama.(Laughter)Three months later, nothing was OK.I was one too.of my in-laws' home,(Laughter)But I knew my story wasn't over,that it couldn't be over.so every day, I made a decision to fight.I had to be vulnerable like Stephanieand sacrifice my ego.I had to be adaptable like Carlyand resurrect myself and my careerlike a phoenix from the ashes.Eventually I got an interview.After 15 years in news and entertainment,nine months of unemploymentand this one interview,I had an offer for an entry level job.I was 37 years oldand I was back from the dead.and we can choose to make it a beginning.Tina and Cord did get divorced,So remember,as long as there is breath in your body,it's never too late to change your story.Thank you.(Applause)



adam_galinsky_how_to_speak_up_for_yourself
1159437

Speaking up is hard to do.when my wife and I became new parents.It was an amazing moment.It was exhilarating and elating,but it was also scary and terrifying.and we were unsureAnd we wanted to call our pediatrician,So we worried.And we waited.Our son is fine now,But in that moment,I should've spoken up, but I didn't.and for one of his first films,He was excited,and he was inclined to accept the offer.But as a negotiations researcher,I insisted he make a counteroffer,and I helped him craft the perfect one.And it was perfect --it was perfectly insulting.The company was so offended,they literally withdrew the offerand my brother was left with nothing.when they can assert themselves,when they can push their interests,when they can express an opinion,when they can make an ambitious ask.That's what happened with my brother.But sometimes we're too weak.That's what happened with my wife and I.And this range of acceptable behaviors --Now, the first thing we need to know is:What is my range?it's actually pretty dynamic.and that's your power.Your power determines your range.What is power?Power comes in lots of forms.So my brother had no alternatives;he lacked power.The company had lots of alternatives;they had power.or new to an organizationor new to an experience,like my wife and I as new parents.Sometimes it's at work,Sometimes it's in relationships,our range is very wide.We have a lot of leeway in how to behave.But when we lack power, our range narrows.We have very little leeway.The low-power double bind happensbut if we do speak up, we get punished.and women who do speak up get punished.but they have barriers to doing so.is not really a gender double bind,it's a really a low-power double bind.And what looks like a gender differenceor men and women,about the sexes."But in study after study,is really power.And so it's the low-power double bind.and we lack power.We have a narrow range,and our double bind is very large.And over the last couple decades,When I feel powerful,I feel confident, not fearful;I expand my own range.When other people see me as powerful,they grant me a wider range.Speaking up is risky,in an important finding.and are just as ambitious.That's when they advocate for others.When they advocate for others,They become more assertive.Like a mama bear defending her cubs,How do we do that?is something called perspective-taking.And perspective-taking is really simple:When I take your perspective,and I think about what you really want,But here's the problem:perspective-taking is hard to do.So let's do a little experiment.your finger -- put it up.as quickly as possible.I'm going to show you two picturesof someone with an E on their forehead --my former student, Erika Hall.And you can see over here,that's the correct E.That's the perspective-taking EWe often get self-focused.And he says, "Give me $2,000,She took a step back.She took his perspective,He asked for a specific amount of money.So she said,"Why did you ask for $2,000?"unless I get him $2,000 immediately."you want to take out a loan."(Laughter)"Why don't you come back to my office,(Laughter)So when we take someone's perspective,and that is to signal flexibility.Let's say option A:Or option B:$23,000 and a three-year warranty.it lowers their defenses,it works with parents.When my niece was four,What if I gave my daughter a choice?This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt.This pant or that pant? OK, that pant.And it worked brilliantly.when people feel comfortable speaking up,the number one answer is:So we want to get allies on our side.How do we do that?Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear.When we advocate for others,but we also earn strong allies.is by asking other people for advice.and we're expressing humility.And that's the self-promotion double bind.The self-promotion double bindno one notices.And if we do, we're not likable.And this is so powerfulit even works when you see it coming.of asking for advice.And three, it still worked!I took their perspective,I became more invested in their calls,is when we have expertise.Expertise gives us credibility.We only need good evidence.We need excellent evidence.is by tapping into our passion.and just say to them,I've had people do this all over the worldand I asked them,when they described their passion?"And the answers are always the same."Their eyes lit up and got big.""They smiled a big beaming smile.""They used their hands all over --(Laughter)And then I said to them,They said, "My eyes lit up.I smiled.I leaned in."When we tap into our passion,Here's a picture of us.My dad was a psychologist like me,like my brother.And he said, "The lighter your touch,grow, change and expand the self.Play it well,and your days will be mostly joyful."What my dad was sayingSo when a scene calls for it,be a ferocious mama bearand a humble advice seeker.Have excellent evidence and strong allies.Be a passionate perspective taker.And if you use those tools --and your days will be mostly joyful.Thank you.(Applause)

how we make decisions,how we act individually and in groups,how we exchange value.like legal systems,corporations,marketplaces.and it's called the blockchain.Now, that's a pretty bold statement,I actually want you to rememberand the story is this.As humans, we find waysto lower uncertainty about one anotherso that we can exchange value.of institutions as a tool in economicsand be able to do tradewas the Nobel economist Douglass North.He passed away at the end of 2015,like a constitution,and informal constraints, like bribery.These institutions are really the greaseWe had some informal constraints in place,or social repercussions.As our societies grew more complexand our trade routes grew more distant,we built up more formal institutions,institutions like banks for currency,governments, corporations.and our personal control was much lower.to facilitate human economic activity.As Douglass North saw it,And I believe we are now enteringa further and radical evolutionof how we interact and trade,but we can do it with technology alone.So what is the blockchain?across a peer-to-peer network.It's basically a public registryof who owns what and who transacts what.It's not an app.It's not a company.We can see everything on Wikipedia.and we can create our own wikis,and the changes to that data over time.On the blockchain,that stores many kinds of assets.It stores the history of custodianship,ownership and locationother digital assetslike a title of ownership of IP.It could be a certificate, a contract,real world objects,even personal identifiable information.but at its core, that's how it works.Which brings me to my pointof how blockchains lower uncertaintyin radical ways.So uncertainty is kind of a big termin economics,but I want to go through three forms of itwhere blockchains can play a role.not having visibility into a transactionAre they a power user?Reviews, ratings, checkmarks:that we cobble together todayThink about how many profiles you have.from any source.This allows us to create a user-controlledportable identity.More than a profile,it means you can selectively revealthe different attributes about youthat help facilitate trade or interaction,or that you're over 21,by revealing the cryptographic proofHaving this kind of portable identitymeans we can do all kinds of human tradein a totally new way.in who we're dealing with.The second uncertainty that we often faceI want some degree of transparency.but for many kinds of goods and data,things like medicine, luxury goods,The problem in many companies,across a horizontal supply chain.they don't have the same database.They don't use the same infrastructure,Using the blockchain, we can createBy this I meanor trust each other,because they each have the abilityThink back to Wikipedia.It's a shared database,and even though it has multiple readersand multiple writers at the same time,it has one single truth.So we can create that using blockchains.As a real-world object travels along,adding value as it goes.The last uncertainty that we often faceWhat if you don't send me the smartphone?Can I get my money back?Blockchains allow us to write code,binding contracts,between individualswithout a third party enforcer.You are financing that phone,but you don't need to release the fundsYou got the phone.that blockchains lower our uncertainties,because it means to some degreeIt means a lot of human economic activitycan get collateralized and automated,about this use of technologyis our mutual distrust.So rather than all of our uncertaintiesslowing us downand requiring institutionsand potentially save the rainforest.and probably failfor our economy.from financial institutionsof creating a record of human exchange,of exchange of currency,even of our own personal attributes,in a totally new way.So in some ways,they become a technological institutionthat has a lot of the benefitsbut it does this in a decentralized way.into certainties.because we are about to face a worldwhere distributed, autonomous institutionshave quite a significant role.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.I think I understood that it's coming,it offers a lot of potential,and it's complex.My lab is pretty much focusedBut you use it every day,who kind of get it and can tinker aroundor for finding those best use casesBG: Thank you. Thanks for coming to TED.BW: Thanks.(Applause)

Machines are more efficient;In fact, I want them to become beautiful.Beauty is an elusive concept.For me it's a goal by Lionel Messi.(Laughter)So bear with meFirst: do the unnecessary.[Do the Unnecessary]A few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya,Some called it a PR stunt,others -- a genuine act of giving back.It came completely out of the blue.and employees were so surprisedThey create something out of nothingbecause they're completely unnecessary.I once worked at a companythat was the result of a mergerWe were merging 9,000 software engineerswith 1,000 creative types.we decided last minuteI didn't know back thenNo, of course not.you cut everything.So do not kill your orange balloons.The second principle:create intimacy.[Create Intimacy]The marriage researcher John Gottman saysthat the secret of a healthy relationshipit's small moments of attachment.In other words, intimacy.In our networked organizations,we tout the strength of weak ties"Intimacy --not connectedness --intimacy is the opposite of loneliness."The humanitarian organization CAREin villages in northern India.But it realized quicklyto one of the Khajuraho Temples,known for their famous erotic sculptures.their own experiences of gender equalitywith the coworkers and the partners.It was eye-opening for the participants.it also broke down invisible barriersSo this is how you create intimacy.No masks ...or lots of masks.(Laughter)When Danone, the food company,it gathered the management teamseniority levels and regionsfor a three-day strategy retreat.wigs, crazy hats, feather boas,huge glasses and so on.And they left with concrete outcomesand full of enthusiasm.why it worked,(Laughter)(Applause)Because wigs erase hierarchy,and hierarchy kills intimacy --both ways,for the CEO and the intern.to show something true about ourselves.suffered betrayals and disappointments,The risk to be ugly.[Be Ugly]that look like anything but work:(Laughter)we speak of play and gamification,they have graduated.(Laughter)but ugly cuts clean to the bone,"as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.To be authentic is to be ugly.Like this manufacturerand there were hundreds of them --which they called "the ugly room."it was celebrated.The ugliest part of our body is our brain.Literally and neurologically.modern art, atonal music,jazz, maybe --VR goggles for that matter --strange objects, sounds and people.But we've all been ugly once.We were a weird-looking baby,a new kid on the block, a foreigner.The Center for Political Beauty,an activist collective in Berlin,With the permission of relatives,transported them all the way to Berlin,if only after their death.but they are much needed.only answers and no questions.They remain incomplete,[Remain Incomplete]Recently I was in Paris,which stands for "up all night,"the self-organized protest movementAnd at the core of this adhocracyusing a specially designed sign language.It was messy --full of controversies and contradictions.And how fitting that Paris --the city of ideals, the city of beauty --was it's stage.It reminds us that like great cities,They are movements;so they avoid ever becoming banal.We find them beautiful.So to do the unnecessary,to create intimacy,to be ugly,to remain incomplete --And as we disrupt, and are disrupted,the least we can do is to ensureand design for them.we need a new radical humanism.Because if we don't,we might end up feeling like aliensthat have no appreciation whatsoeverfor the unnecessary,the intimate,the incompleteand definitely not for the ugly.Thank you.(Applause)

You think about the driverless.but when I go in one, you know,I want it really slow,I am not ready for a driverless airplane.How about a driverless world?And I ask you thatbecause we are increasingly in one.It's not supposed to be that way.We're number one,the United States is large and in charge.have basically been the same thing.or it's the IMF, the World Bank,the Bretton Woods Accord on currency,these were American institutions,That was the way the world worked.here it is.This is our view of how the world is run.President Obama has got the red carpet,he goes down Air Force One,and the G20.Oh my God. Right?This is how we landedon the tarmac --no red carpet,kind of left out the bottom of the planeLater on in the G20,well, there's Obama.(Laughter)Hi, George.Hi, Norman.That's what Putin wanted to talk about.He's increasingly calling the shots.He's the one willing to do stuff there.There's not a lot of mutual like or trust,Surely, when the leaders are all onstage,Uh-oh.(Laughter)Xi Jinping seems fine.Angela Merkel has -- she always does --that look, she always does that.the problem isit's a G-Zero world that we live in,The G20 doesn't work,So globalization is continuing.faster and faster than ever before,but Americanization is not.So if I've convinced you of that,for the whole world.I'll go around it.And then I want to talk aboutwhat we think right herein the United States and in New York.Well, we're herebecause the United States,that were failed.We don't want to do that anymore.so they don't want to see it particularly.And we have an energy revolutionor the architect of global trade.Well, then you look to Europe,has been the transatlantic relationship.China does want to do more leadership.They do, but only in the economic sphere,in competition with that of the US.The Russians want to do more leadership.You see that in Ukraine,in the Baltic states, in the Middle East,but not with the Americans.They want their own preferences and order.That's why we are where we are.So what happens going forward?Let's start easy,with the Middle East.(Laughter)You know, I left a little out,but you get the general idea.Look, there are three reasonsbecause oil was expensive.And number threeto really rise up against.Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world,and so failed states,terrorism, refugees and the rest.Does the entire Middle East fall apart?OK, how about this guy?He's playing a poor hand very well.But long term -- I didn't mean that.But long term, long term,if you think that the Russianswhen we said they weren't going to,and the EU encroaching them,It's not all bad. Right?Asia actually looks a lot better.There are real leaders across Asia,they have a lot of political stability.They're there for a while.Mr. Modi in India,in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan,the most powerful leader in Chinasince Mao.Now look, there are problems in Asia.tested yet another nuclear weapon.to wave the flag,to go xenophobic,to actually allow escalationAnd that's what they're actually doing.Let's turn to Europe.across all of the European states.Let me tell you that over the long term,in a G-Zero world,that would be less of a problem,and nearest the Middle Eastdifferent social stabilitySo Europe was able to truly expandunder the G7,But the periphery,will not look that good at all.Latin America, a lot of populism,made the economies not go so well.Increasingly, they're coming back.We see that in Argentina.We see it with the openness in Cuba.over the coming years.(Laughter)Africa, right?for a few African countries,entrepreneurship taking off.But for most of the countries in Africa,it's going to be a lot more dicey:extreme climate conditions,very poor governance,Those countries can fall off the map.Finally, back to the United States.What do I think about us?Because there are a lot of upset people,not here at TEDx, I know,but in the United States, my God,I understand that.Look, I do think we have to recognize,my fellow campers,(Laughter)Now, I just told youabout our fellow campers.Right? And from that perspective,we look OK.A lot of people in that context say,You know, our neighbors are awesome:Those are awesome neighbors.God knows we know it here in New York.than it is in Europe.These are factors of large magnitude.That's not the situation.That's the reality of the United States.Now, that sounds pretty good.Here's the challenge.In a G-Zero world, the way you leadis by example.the 21st century is changing,it's not just they're faster campers.We want to emulate them.for leading by example.We can still be the global sheriff.it is getting objectively harderfor the Americans to impose their will,even have great influence,on the global order.Are we prepared to truly lead by example?What would we have to do to fix thisafter November,after the next president comes in?A depression would do that.God forbid, another 9/11 could do that.Or, absent crisis,are themselves urgent enoughto force our leaders to change,and that we have those voices.Through our cell phones, individually,There is, of course, a third choice,perhaps the most likely one,and in four years time you invite me back,and I will give this speech yet again.Thank you very, very much.(Applause)

Let's talk about trust.We all know trust is fundamental,but when it comes to trusting people,something profound is happening.Please raise your handWow. That's a lot of you.Who owns Bitcoin?Still a lot of you. OK.to help you find a mate.(Laughter)(Laughter)These are all examples of how technologyis creating new mechanismsAnd yet at the same time,trust in institutions --banks, governments and even churches --is collapsing.So what's happening here,and who do you trust?with a rather funny-sounding name,BlaBlaCar.The average ride taken is 320 kilometers.(Laughter)Bla, not a lot,bla bla, you want a nice bit of chitchat,from London to Paris.(Laughter)never get in a car with a stranger.every single month.to the way that we've always done it.Let's try to visualize this together.OK. I want you to close your eyes.I'm on this big red circle. I can see.So close your eyes.(Laughter) (Applause)I'll do it with you.between you and something unknown.It can be a place you've never been to.You got it?OK. You can open your eyes now.For you to leap from a place of certainty,you need a force to pull you over the gap,and that remarkable force is trust.Trust is an elusive concept,I trust my childrenIt's a word we use a lot,But I don't like this definition of trust,of what it enables us to doand how it empowers usto connect with other people.So I define trust a little differently.to enable us to cope with uncertainty,to place our faith in strangers,to keep moving forward.Human beings are remarkableat taking trust leaps.into a website?That's a trust leap.I distinctly remember telling my dadand he rightfully pointed out(Laughter)trust between people,and it's a fascinating area to study,Does trust transfer?So if you trust finding a mate on Tinder,and I call it "climbing the trust stack."On the first level,you have to trust the idea.So you have to trustit feels weird, even risky,Our behaviors transform,often relatively quickly.is whether we can better understandthrough the lens of trust.local, institutionaland what we're now entering, distributed.So for a long time,until the mid-1800s,So say I lived in a villagewith the first five rows of this audience,and we all knew one another,and say I wanted to borrow money.and if I didn't pay him back,you'd all know I was dodgy.I would get a bad reputation,In the mid-19th century,that didn't know us as individuals.We started to place our trustinto black box systems of authority,and less trust directly in other people.the News Corp phone hacking,the Volkswagen emissions scandal,the fact that only one measly bankeror more recently the Panama PapersAnd the thing that really surprises meis why do leaders find it so hardto apologize, I mean sincerely apologize,when our trust is broken?because we are fed upbut what's happening nowWe're starting to realizethat institutional trustwasn't designed for the digital age.Conventions of how trust is built,managed, lost and repaired --in brands, leaders and entire systems --is being turned upside down.Now, this is exciting,but it's frightening,even our loved ones.He was perplexed at how a companycould work so well across 191 countries.and he looked at me a bit strangely,and I said --I don't always bother to hang my towels upwhen I'm finished in the hotel,to transact in the future.in the real world,make us more accountablein ways we cannot yet even imagine.I am not saying we do not need hotelsor traditional forms of authority.But what we cannot denyand it's creating this big shiftaway from the 20th centurythat was defined by institutional trusttowards the 21st centurythat will be fueled by distributed trust.Trust is no longer top-down.It's being unbundled and inverted.It's no longer opaque and linear.A new recipe for trust is emergingand is accountability-based.And this shift is only going to acceleratewith the emergence of the blockchain,Now let's be honest,is mind-blowing.some pretty complicated conceptswith terrible names.or persons called Satoshi Nakamoto.(Applause)But let's try to imagine this.and they are filled with assets.So that could be a property title.It could be a stock trade.Every time something movesthat asset transfer is time-stampedand publicly recorded on the blockchain.It's that simple. Right.So the real implication of the blockchainsuch as a lawyer,to facilitate the exchange.So if we go back to the trust stack,you still have to trust the idea,you have to trust the platform,in the traditional sense.The implications are huge.available to everyone,and widely overused example,all around the worldand I happened to notice a tweetAnd he wrote,(Laughter)I'd never heard of it until today."Now, the taxi associations,Now, this is a really strong illustrationyou cannot reverse the story.and ride with Uber.11 million rides taken every day.That's 127 rides per second,that seeing a namemakes them feel safer,and as you may have experienced,This is just the beginning,because the real disruption happeningisn't technological.It's the trust shift it creates,so that we can get it rightThank you very much.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)

they're often really energetic?Whether it's training for a marathon,picking up an old hobby,or learning a new skill,for most people,Self-transformation is empowering,energizing, even exhilarating."Awaken the Giant Within,""Practicing the Power of Now,""You are a Badass:(Laughter)When it comes to self-transformation,But there's another type of transformationThe transformation of organizations.If you're like most people,you're thinking, "Uh-oh."(Laughter)"Layoffs."The blood drains from your face,your mind goes into overdrive,Well, you can run,but you really can't hide.involved in organizations.And due to changes in globalization,changes due to advances in technologyand other factors,In fact,she said, "Always-on transformation?That sounds exhausting."and you would be right.the way we always have been.But because we can't hide,we need to sort out two things.First,why is transformation so exhausting?And second, how do we fix it?First of all,let's acknowledge that change is hard.People naturally resist change,especially when it's imposed on them.First of all,leaders often wait too long to act.As a result,everything is happening in crisis mode.Which, of course, tends to be exhausting.Or, given the urgency,as soon as the crisis is over.This kind of approachIn order to get test scores to go up,teachers will end up teaching to the test.Now, that approach can work;test results often do go up.So given these obstacles,what can we doso rather than being exhausting,it's actually empowering and energizing?all of which have one thing in common:putting people first.is to inspire through purpose.To motivate more broadly,Take LEGO.Under their very capable leadership,the North Star,linking and guiding all of them,has been Lego's powerful purpose:Expanding globally?It's not about increasing sales,Investment and innovation?It's not about developing new products,but about enabling more childrenNot surprisingly,is to go all in.Too many transformationslayoffs under the guise of transformation.In the face of relentless competition,to downsize the organization,But losing weight aloneTo winyou need to go all in.You need to go all in.Rather than just cutting costs,you need to think about initiativesinitiatives to drive growth,and very importantly,is to enable people with the capabilitiesYou know, frankly, I'm not that good,but I do have one distinct capability;I am remarkably fast at finding my bike.(Laughter)By the time I finish the swim,almost all the bikes are already gone.(Laughter)Real triathletes know that each leg --the swim, the bike, the run --really requires different capabilities,different tools,different skills, different techniques.Likewise when we transform organizations,Chronos,a global software company,software products --to building software as a service.first of all they invested in new toolsThey also invested in skill development,so that their employees would be ableAnd very importantly,Because of these investments,Chronos employees actually felt energizedand empowered in their new roles.In the era of "always-on" transformation,change is a constant.My fourth imperative thereforein February 2014,This included changes to strategy,the organizationand very importantly, the culture.not exactly conducive to learning.Nadella took this head-on.for a living, learning culture,shifting from a fixed mindset,to a growth mindset,Well, early days,In a transformation,a leader needs to have a vision,a clear road map with milestones,In other words, you need to be directive.you also need to be inclusive.I live in the San Francisco Bay area.And right now,We won the 2015 championship,and we're favored to win again this year.There are many explanations for this.They have some fabulous players,but one of the key reasonsWhen Kerr came to the Warriors in 2014,Kerr came in, and he had a clear vision,and he immediately got to work.From the outset,During games he would often ask,"What are you seeing that I'm missing?"The Warriors were down two games to onea bold move by any measure.And it is widely viewedBecause of Kerr's leadership style,And Kerr not only listened,but he implemented the ideaand then afterwards,gave U'Ren all the credit --In the era of "always-on" transformation,We owe it to ourselves,to our organizationsand to society more broadlyTo do that,we need to start putting people first.Thank you.(Applause)

How much do you get paid?Don't answer that out loud.But put a number in your head.Again, don't answer out loud.(Laughter)At work, how much do you thinkDo you know?Should you know?But admit it -- you kind of want to know.We're not supposed to tell our neighbors,then all hell would break loose.There'd be arguments, there'd be fights,there might even be a few people who quit.inside a company?For the past several years,And the question of pay keeps coming up.And the answers keep surprising.It turns out that pay transparency --and for the organization.they're more likely to feel underpaidand maybe even discriminated against.In one famous example from decades ago,the management of Vanity Fair magazineactually circulated a memo entitled:Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood,all writers in the Algonquin Round Table,decided to stand up for transparencyand showed up for work the next day(Laughter)Imagine showing up for workYou see, keeping salaries secretif you knew everybody's salary.Economists warn that information asymmetrycan cause markets to go awry.Someone leaves a pay stub on the copier,In fact, they even warnAnd I think we're almost there.Here's why:In a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees,said that they felt they were underpaid.or right at the market rate.Are you underpaid?Well, wait -- how do you even know,Next, information asymmetry, pay secrecy,was 23 percent.But in the Federal Government,might feel uncomfortable,but isn't it less uncomfortableand pay transparency does that.Like Dane Atkinson.in a pay secrecy conditiondramatically different salaries,And the results have been amazing.And in study after study,and how that pay compares to their peers',That's why Dane's not alone.From technology start-ups like Buffer,is available on the company intranetfor all to see.It's not one size fits all.Some post their salaries for all to see.Some only keep it inside the company.Some post the formula for calculating pay,and others post the pay levelsand affix everybody to that level.So you don't have to make signsthat you made at home.For those of you that have the authorityto move forward towards transparency:it's time to move forward.it's time to stand up for your right to.So how much do you get paid?You should know.And so should they.Thank you.(Applause)

Now, I want to tell you about the YapThere's a story about these sailorsThe sailors got back to the main islandand they told everyone what had happened.And everyone decided that, actually, yes,it was still part of the Yap economy.a hundred years ago.all of that gold over to Europe.It's just like those Rai stones.about a dollar or a stone or a coin.is because we've all decided they should.And because we've decided that,they do.that we have with each other.Money isn't anything objective.A collective fiction.And that's a really powerful concept.In the past two decades,we've begun to use digital money.So I get paid via direct deposit,I pay my rent via bank transfer,I pay my taxes online.And every month,All of these interactionsin seconds.Now when this works,that changes on a computer.And when it doesn't,And a lot of times, they don't.There's a lot of friction in the system.to implement chip and pin?That's friction.is really expensive:friction.friction.If I'm a PayPal merchantand PayPal wrongly flags me for fraud,that's it.Instagram?My photos are everywhere.They don't inter-operate.And as a result,my photo library is a mess.The same thing happensAnd it makes transaction costs go up.Money only moves at the speed of banks.We're about to enter a new phase of money.The future of money is programmable.When we combine software and currency,In a programmable world,And when this happens,Money will be directed by software,and it will just safely and securely flow.Cryptocurrencies are digital moneythat isn't run by any government or bank.but there are hundreds of them.And these things are real money.The sushi restaurant down my streettakes Bitcoin.But it's not just for small transactions.called cryptography.And it's so powerful that at timesand turning the tide of the war.a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.So what the banks used to give us --trustworthy digital money transfer --to secure our transactions.We can do it ourselves.Imagine that we had this magic paper.and if you write something on it,Let's say we just give everyone this paperin the Bitcoin system.And I can look at minein the entire Bitcoin economy.Except, it's not done through paper.It's done through computer code,around the world.who owns what Bitcoin.But where do bitcoins actually come from?according to a schedule.Imagine that we had 15 dice,Whenever the dice come up all sixes,we say that we win.And when they do,we say that they've solved the puzzle.The computer that solves the puzzleand collects its reward: new bitcoins.And in the act of solving this puzzle,and add to the list of transactions.and we call them Bitcoin miners.Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner.You can go download the software right nowI can't say that I would recommend it,is equivalent to that of a small country.So, the first set of cryptocurrenciesCryptocurrencies are the first stepAnd in a world with programmable money,I can pay anyone else securelyAnd I can send money around the world.This is a really amazing thing.It's the idea of permission-less innovation.allocate and decide on value.to a pharmaceutical company.They can run large-scale data analysisand provide me with a cryptographic proofand getting a cable bill,that I would enjoy?Imagine an Internet without ads,we just pay.Interestingly, things like micro-paymentsfor more constructive things.would we still have spam?We're not at this world yet,but it's coming.works pretty well,If you were the first person on your blockand is still slower than a horse?"But we all know how that story turns out.When all of our transactions are online,All new technology comes with trade-offs.Mobile phones are annoyingall the time.With programmable money,from the architecture of the network.Programmable money democratizes money.in ways that we can't even predict.Thank you.(Applause)

I'm a journalist,so I like to look for the untold stories,choosing a partner, making babies.So for the last few years,I've been trying to understandWe live in tenuous times.than they were.After all, America is deeply investedin this idea of economic transcendence,earning more, buying more, being more.so kids in Brazil and China and even Kenyainherit our insatiable expectationfor more.it didn't actually make me feel sad.It felt like a provocation."Better off" -- based on whose standards?Is "better off" finding a secure jobThose are nearly extinct.and it's estimated that by 2020,OK, so is better off just a number?adjusted for inflation.Less of us are doing that.to hold that deed.we're not earning as much money,and we're not living in big fancy houses.Toll the funeral bellsfor everything that made America great.But,of a life well lived?In the wake of the Great Recession,than dollars and cents.Now, let me be very clear:plain and simple.by employers and financial institutions.is anything but profoundly immoral.But,is that the art of living wellis often practiced most masterfullyby the most vulnerable.I've come to believeIt confronts us with profound questions,in times of relative comfort.How should we work?How should we live?All of us, whether we realize it or not,seek answers to these questions,He had, as unbelievable as it might sound,21 children,with one woman, my great-grandmother,Now, I'm pregnant with my second child,So my grandfather, their son,became a traveling salesman,and he lived boom and bust.and pretending his parents weren't home.to go back to the orthodontist.So my dad, unsurprisingly,became a bankruptcy lawyer.Couldn't write this in a novel, right?for my brother and I.that allows me to question its value,in the 21st century.So let's dig into this first question:How should we work?We should work like our mothers.That's right -- we've spent decadesAnd many have done backbends to fit in,creating a patchwork of meaning and moneyfor those that they love.My mom called it "just making it work."Whatever you call it,Now, artist Ann Hamilton has said,"Labor is a way of knowing."Labor is a way of knowing.In other words, what we work onis what we understand about the world.If this is true, and I think it is,and the sick ones and the aging ones,have disproportionately benefitedknowing the human condition.By prioritizing care,men are, in a sense, staking their claimto the full range of human existence.It's all nonlinear from here.So we need to stop asking kids,"What do you want to be when you grow up?"Their work will constantly change.The common denominator is them.So the more they understand their giftsand create crews of ideal collaborators,the better off they will be.We need portable health benefits.or care for vulnerable others,without becoming destitute.We need to reinvent labor organizing.our 21st century values,is long overdue --just ask your mother.Now, how about the second question:How should we live?We should livelike our immigrant ancestors.When they came to America,always knew how to fill one more belly,no matter how small the food available.the white picket fence.and we think success, self-possession.what it really does is divides us.and reclaiming village life,reclaiming interdependence instead.Fifty million of us, for example,live in intergenerational households.say it's improved their relationships.of daily community.with other single moms,has 50,000 users.And people over 65 are especially proneThey understand that their quality of lifeyoung and old alike.But all the research proves otherwise.Now, I've experienced this firsthand.It's 1.5 acres of persimmon trees,different sizes, different shapes,mean our electricity bill rarely exceedsmore than five bucks in a month.and professions,But additionally,where we have common meals twice a week.often have one of two extreme reactions.I would never want to do that."full stop, end of sentence.but you also share the emotional labor.to get all of your emotional needs met,to talk about a hard day at workto ask for advice.this humble acknowledgmentto emulate and count on.Turns out, adults are healthier, too.It's a lot of pressure,a cohousing community like mine,and look out for one another.It's good common sense, right?And yet, money has often made us dumbabout reaching out.The most reliable wealthis found in relationship.I've got some good news for you:Maybe you can't afford your dream home,If you're a textbook success,but that the world doesn't reward.Only you can know.I know that I am not a tributeto my great-grandmother,who lived such a short and brutish life,There is no home big enoughI am a tribute to herwe may, in fact, be insecure.or supple.even lose faith in ourselves.Or we can turn outward,Turns out, the biggest dangerThe biggest danger is achieving a dreamthat you don't actually believe in.So don't do that.Do the harder, more interesting thing,is a tribute to your ancestors.That is the beautiful struggle.Thank you.(Applause)

It's funny the things you forget.I would have already gotten out of the carand pretended to have died.(Laughter)(Applause)Because that's how you die.(Laughter)(Laughter)Settle down.(Laughter)I don't know about that,which will remain namelessfor predominantly legal reasons,but which I'm going to call "SafeMart."(Laughter)And I resented this,and I pressed, "Unsubscribe."And I thought that'd be the end of it."Just two weeksuntil SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"So I tried it again. Right?And here's the problem:The internet gave us access to everything;but it also gave everything access to us.It's hard enough to discriminateand the minutiae of life,and Candy Crush Saga.And I was really annoyed with them,which I can do quite well.(Laughter)And I thought, no --I'm going to find the game.So I replied to it, and I said,"I literally cannot wait!!!!"(Laughter)"What do you need from me?"(Laughter)Like it needs help.And I said, "What's the plan, Dan?I'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ..."(Laughter)"I'm not sure what you mean."(Laughter)(Laughter)He said, "I think you have misunderstood."(Laughter)I was getting excited."(Laughter)"I'm sorry you're disappointed."(Laughter)I said, "Not to worry.Let's do something anyway!(Laughter)(Laughter)I said, "Let's not get into who did what.(Laughter)(Applause)(Laughter)because the next email I got was this:(Laughter)That's outrageous.I said, "Dan?"(Laughter)And I said, "Danny?"I said, "D-Dog?"(Laughter)"The store is now open."(Laughter)And then we were back to this.can be fun if you find the right game.So,this is what I replied:(Laughter)(Applause)And we just, uh ...(Laughter)It was like we were dancing.It was just a beautiful relationship.We just kept going.It was lovely.and I had other stuff to do,believe it or not.it just pings one back.So I set it up, and it says,And I put it on the serverand set it running.(Laughter)I'll be honest, guys --then I forgot about it.(Laughter)I checked back on it the other day,We're on 21,439.(Applause)for eternity.So guys, just remember:and often mundanity of modern life,don't fight the frustration.Let it be the catalystfor whimsy.(Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)

on the next few decadeshas arrived.And it's not social media.It's not big data.It's not robotics.It's not even AI.You'll be surprised to learnIt's called the blockchain. Blockchain.but I believe that this is nowthe next generation of the internet,and for all of you, individually.I'm actually not sending you the original,I'm sending you a copy.And that's great.This is democratized information.But when it comes to assets --things like money,financial assets like stocks and bonds,loyalty points, intellectual property,music, art, a vote,carbon credit and other assets --sending you a copy is a really bad idea.If I send you 100 dollars,(Laughter)and that I can't send it to you.by cryptographers for a long time.middlemen like banks, government,to establish trust in our economy.of every kind of commerce,And overall, they do a pretty good job.But there are growing problems.To begin, they're centralized.JP Morgan, the US Federal Government,LinkedIn, Home Depot and othersfound that out the hard way.to have a bank account.They slow things down.but it can take days or weeksAnd they take a big piece of the action --They capture our data,and that means we can't monetize itor use it to better manage our lives.Our privacy is being undermined.And the biggest problem is that overall,what if there were an internet of value --running on millions of computersand available to everybody.all without powerful intermediaries?and, perhaps propitiously,without a third party.that ignited the world,in many places.Now, don't be confused about Bitcoin --Bitcoin is an asset; it goes up and down,More broadly, it's a cryptocurrency.And that's of greater interest.It's called blockchain.people everywhere can trust each otherand transact peer to peer.but by collaboration, by cryptographyand by some clever code.I call this, "The Trust Protocol."Fair enough.are not stored in a central place,using the highest level of cryptography.And when a transaction is conducted,it's posted globally,across millions and millions of computers.And out there, around the world,is a group of people called "miners."These miners do a lot of work.And every 10 minutes,kind of like the heartbeat of a network,a block gets createdAnd they compete:is rewarded in digital currency,And then -- this is the key part --that block is linked to the previous blockand the previous blockto create a chain of blocks.And every one is time-stamped,kind of like with a digital waxed seal.So if I wanted to go and hack a blockI'd have to hack that block,plus all the preceding blocks,simultaneously,that's watching me.Tough to do.This is infinitely more secureBlockchain. That's how it works.So the Bitcoin blockchain is just one.There are many.He's [22] years old,It's kind of what it sounds like.It's a contract that self-executes,of agreements between people.And today, on the Ethereum blockchain,to create a new model of democracy,(Applause)Recognize this?Rube Goldberg machine.like crack an egg or shut a door.honestly.each with their own computer system,some of them being 1970s mainframesand three days later, a settlement occurs.there would be no settlement,it's just a change in the ledger.So Wall Street and all around the world,wondering, can we be replaced,Now, why should you care?Well, let me describe some applications.Prosperity.The first era of the internet,the internet of information,because social inequality is growing.and protectionism and xenophobia and worseBrexit being the most recent case.tax people and spread it around more.Could we pre-distribute wealth?by democratizing wealth creation,engaging more people in the economy,Number one:have a tenuous title to it?This happened on a mass scale in Honduras,and this problem exists everywhere.in terms of economic mobility,more important than having a bank account,you can't borrow against it,and you can't plan for the future.to put land titles on a blockchain.And once it's there, this is immutable.You can't hack it.This creates the conditions for prosperityfor potentially billions of people.Secondly:a lot of writers talk about Uberas part of the sharing economy.This is a very powerful idea,My view is that ...these companies are not really sharing.who have a room to rent.And when someone wants to rent a room,it identifies the party,it handles the paymentsAnd it even handles reputation,that room is there,and it's rated, and it's immutable.could be disrupted,and this would be good for prosperity.Number three:to the developing worldis not corporate investment,and it's not even foreign aid.It's remittances.This is the global diaspora;people have left their ancestral lands,and these people are getting ripped off.Analie Domingo is a housekeeper.She lives in Toronto,with some cashIt costs her around 10 percent;Six months ago,without going through an intermediary.who's seven minutes away.she puts them in her wallet.The whole thing took minutes,and it cost her two percent.This is a big opportunity for prosperity.And data is really a new asset class,maybe bigger than previous asset classes,like land under the agrarian economy,or an industrial plant,or even money.And all of you -- we -- create this data.We create this asset,as we go throughout life.the virtual you.And the virtual you is not owned by you --that's the big problem.So today, there are companies workingto create an identity in a black box,the virtual you owned by you.And this black box moves around with youas you travel throughout the world,and it's very, very stingy.that's required to do something.A lot of transactions,They just need to know that they got paid.and enabling you to monetize it.And this is a wonderful thing,Let's get this asset that we createback under our control,where we can own our own identityand manage it responsibly.Finally --(Applause)Finally, number five:who don't receive fair compensation,Take music.it got a million singles,it gets a million streams,you don't get 45k,you get 36 dollars,enough to buy a nice pizza.So Imogen Heap,the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter,She calls it "Mycelia."You want to listen to the song?and the IP rights are all specified.protecting the rights of the author,and because the song has a payment systemin the sense of bank account,all the money flows back to the artist,and they control the industry,rather than these powerful intermediaries.Now, this is --(Applause)This is not just songwriters,it's any creator of content,like art,like inventions,scientific discoveries, journalists.and with blockchains,And that's a wonderful thing.So, these are five opportunitiesout of a dozento solve one problem, prosperity,which is one of countless problemsthat blockchains are applicable to.But my case to you is that, once again,at this uncertain time in human history,and the old order of things,if we will it.Thank you.(Applause)



olivier_scalabre_the_next_manufacturing_revolution_is_here
1225438

Guys, we have an issue.(Laughter)Our global economy stops growing.And it's not new.If we continue like this, we need to learnour children don't get better lives.each of us get a smaller piece.Growth matters a lot.If we look at the history of growth,by big manufacturing revolutions.thanks, Mr. Ford.Why did these manufacturing revolutionscreate huge growth in our economies?It's rather simple:putting more into our economy.I'm here today to tell youand that this change, surprisingly enough,It will get us out of our growth slumpover the last decade.that is currently underway.since the last revolution.to try to revitalize it.we really need to get us growing again.and we specialized them by product.and stockpile it to be sold with demand.This did help productivity for a while.Let's take fashion retail.Traditional clothing companiesWhen fast-fashion competitors like Zarastarted replenishing their stocks fasterYet, with all of their shortcomings,those are the factories we know today.When you open the doors,as it did 50 years ago?It's crazy.and now we hit its limits.We turned to the tech sector --Just to name one: the Internet.We hoped it could produce growth.And indeed, it changed our lives.But it hasn't done much for productivity.despite all of those innovation efforts.Weird.(Laughter)This is why we are not growing.But what if we could combine those forces?Bingo!and it's happening right now.big time.Let me tell you about some of them.They are the size of humans,they actually collaborate with them,and they can be programmedIt will be 25 percent in 10 years.It means that by 2025,advanced robots will complement workersto manufacture 20 percent more outputs,to achieve 20 percent additional growth.This isn't some fancy, futuristic idea.These robots are working for us right now.required for Cyber Monday,the annual peak of online retail.Last year in the US,That's real economic growth.and it's now making its way through metal.Those are not small industries.Plastic and metals represent 25 percentof global manufacturing production.Let's take a real example.In the aerospace industry,for one reason:they are made up of 20 different partsthat need to be separately producedand then painstakingly assembled.into just one.The results?40 percent more productivity,for this specific industry.goes much beyond productivity.It's about scale customization.with the functionalities you need,with the design you want,with the same cost and lead timeas a product that's been mass produced,Advanced robots can be programmedwithout any setup time or ramp up.it will also become more flexible,It will create a huge macroeconomic shift.In the world of scale customization,consumer proximity is the new norm.The change will be drastic.Globalization will enter a new era.The East-to-West trade flowswill be replaced by regional trade flows.East for East, West for West.When you think about that,the old model was pretty much insane.before they reach their end consumers.creating more employment,more productivity and more growth.Good news, isn't it?But here's the thing with growth --it does not come automatically.Mature economies will have to seize it.That it was something happening far away.We need to reverse thatwill be able to seize this growth.won't be the factory of the world anymore.as those countries are becoming richer.as to produce in France.The new manufacturing revolutionAnd this is good,In the next five years,If we play it right,and a better future for our children.Thank you.(Applause)



ngozi_okonjo_iweala_how_africa_can_keep_rising

an Africa of hope and opportunity,an Africa of entrepreneurs,of death, poverty and disease.And that what I spoke about,The first has to do with Rwanda,on the continent.a little bit like here,So what has Rwanda said?to people in hard-to-reach placesIn doing this, it will save lives.The second story has to do with somethingcarcasses of dead animals and so on.under the auspices of the African UnionWhat does it do?It's a weather-based insurance agency,this money will be paid out to them,instead of waiting for aid to come.to Mauritania, Senegal and Niger.They were able to restore livelihoods,So these are the kinds of storiesBut that narrative is being challenged nowfor the last one and a half decades,I never knew that the Brexit could happensuch as we have.So now we've got this situation,and I think it's time to take stockWhat did they do wrong?so that we can keep Africa rising?that said, "The Lost Continent."But in the 2000s, policymakers learnedto ensure stability,keep inflation low in single digits,give investors, both domestic and foreign,So that was number one.Two, debt.and they didn't have fiscal space.because they were paying debt.to get debt relief.and give debt relief.So this debt relief in 2005Governments were involved in businesswhich they had no business being in.commercialized, privatized or closed,The telecoms revolution came,and African countries jumped on it.In 2000, we had 11 million phone lines.And this has enabled uswhere Africa is actually leading.in this particular technology.for access to alternative energy.You know, people who can now pay for solarbut there were some improvements.Many of you are aware of that.that I want you to know about,But what did we do wrong?Let me mention eight things.(Laughter)So there are eight things we did wrong.We didn't create jobs for our youth.and underemployment is a serious problem.in the urban areas.So we created more billionaires.50 billionaires worth 96 billion dollarsPoverty,And population growth is somethingparticularly how we educate girls.We had investment from the Chinese.So many people are living in the dark,Africa cannot develop in the dark.The other thing we have not donethat we've had for decades.So even though we've been growing,We are still exporting commodities,and trade among ourselves is low.So that's another serious problem.Then governance.Governance is a serious issue.We have weak institutions,and we have to fight tooth and nail,and the way we manage our finances.We also need to be wary of new conflicts,new types of conflicts,and with Al-Shabaab in Kenya.Otherwise, we create a new realityAnd finally, the issue of education.Now, where do we go from there?they forget what made them succeed.Learning what you're successful at,So all those things I said we did right,Very often, we are not consistent.One regime goes out, another comes inWhat does this do?uncertainties for business.They don't know whether and how to invest.and in certain countries,So managing success.on those things we did not do well.First and foremost is infrastructure.We must.The most important thing is power.You cannot develop in the dark.And then governance and corruption:we have to fight.We have to make our countries transparent.We have genius in our young people.I see it every day.and lead the way.And our women, and our girls:They have strength,and we have to unleash that strengthwe find that the rising Africa narrativeis not a fluke.It's a trend.if we unleash our women,we may step backwards sometimes,we may even step sideways,but the trend is clear.Africa will continue to rise.But if you are not invested in Africa,then you will be missingThank you.(Applause)But that's had consequences.How have you been handling this?It's a very difficult subject.they don't just keep quiet.do you give up, or do you fight on?is we have to fight on.We have to create those institutions.We have to find ways to stop these peopleAnd so that's what we did.for us but us.and we just have to do the best we can.to say to those people, you will not win,and we will not be intimidated.Thank you.(Applause)(Applause)

Imagine that you are a product designer.And you've designed a product,You're pitching this productLet's call him Bob.How would that go?Bob, I've got this incredible ideaIt's called the human immune system.Don't worry. I know it's very complicated.First of all, it cleverly uses redundancyleukocytes, white blood cells --before they're actually needed,And it cleverly leverages diversitynatural killer cells, antibodies.The components don't really matter.The point is that together,that evolution has been able to throw up.And the design is completely modular.creating a virtually foolproof system.because here is the really killer feature.The product is completely adaptive.in case they are ever encountered again.And Bob may say something like,that have gone into your presentation,blah blah blah --(Laughter)But honestly, it's total nonsense.are that it is inefficient and complex.Didn't they teach you 80-20?It overreacts,makes things up as it goes alongIf we went with Bob's philosophy,Who could say no to that?and longevity and resilience,when I was asked a very unusual questionby the CEO of a global tech company.And the question was:A seemingly innocent question,can expect a life span of only 30 years.That is less than half of the life spanthat its employees can expect to enjoy.about what happens 30 years out.or will fail within just five years.for longer than any company?As a lapsed biologist,my friend Simon Levin,ranging from natural tropical rainforeststhrough to managed forests and fisheries.And we asked ourselves the question:actually cropped up again and again,from redundancy through to embeddedness.of long-lived social systems,believe it or not.We also went on to look at business,that were resilient and long-lived,collapses.in Osaka, Japan.It was built by a Korean artisan,Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi,was still around 1,428 years later.in the world.So how is Kongō Gumi doing today?Not too well, I'm afraid.It borrowed very heavilyto invest in real estate.The company failed,by the Kongō family,Speaking of company failures:the company that declared bankruptcyin January 2012.Why did Fujifilm --to diversify into a number of areas,ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals,to medical systems to biomaterials.But in aggregate,to survive and flourish.As the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it,than the rivals.He meant, of course,diversityand adaptation.completely wiped out, in one evening,The ultimate test of resilience.Can you imagine how long it took?Just five days.How was this possible?to repurpose production,fill the missing braking valve capacityand have car production come online again.embeddedness in an integrated systemexisting capacity.in software and electronics.for potentially disruptive technologies.It acquires those technologies very early,even at the risk of failureor the risk of self-disruption.Essilor stays ahead of its game,and has delivered spectacular performancefor over 40 years,why are they not commonplace in business?Why do we not use these words every day?If we think back to our pitch to Bob,in order to apply the principleswe first need to think differentlyabout business.we use what I call "mechanical thinking."We set goals,we analyze problems,we construct and we adhere to plans,and more than anything else,Now, don't get me wrong --of addressing relatively simple challengesin relatively stable environments.overall --until about the mid-1980s,when the conjunction of globalizationthat we now increasingly face?as embodied by our six principles.about when and howwe can shape, rather than control,unpredictable and complex situations.and releasing a bird.The ball would head in a straight line,probably towards the intended target,and the bird certainly would not.So what do you think?Not at all.Every small entrepreneurial companynaturally thinks and acts biologically.Why?through brute force.It lacks the scale to buffer change,for a start-up to survive.Now, the irony is, of course,But along the way somewhere,Every company I know spends plenty of timeHow good is our competitive game?In addition, let's also considerHow long will that game last?Thank you very much.(Applause)

behind 11.5 million documents,verify it and make sense of it?That was a challengeThis is one of many firms around the worldlike the British Virgin Islands,every client file,every email,from 1977 to the present day.It represented the biggest cachethat anyone had ever seen.Where do you even begin to tell a storyBut one user alone can never make senseof such a vast amount of information.So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached outto my organization in Washington, DC,share.(Laughter)We fiercely guard our secrets,at times even from our editors,they'll want that story right away.And to be frank,when you get a good story,you like to keep the glory to yourself.to cover stories in a truly global way.rather than being frightened of it.But where there is crisis,there is also opportunity.The first challenge presentedThere were nearly five million emails,in the cloud.in 76 countries --from the BBC in Britainto Le Monde newspaper in Franceto the Asahi Shimbun in Japan.than a Nigerian journalist?Who best in Canada than a Canadian?We chose our media partners based on trustOver the next few months,The biggest information leak in historyworking shoulder to shoulder,sharing information,but telling no one.For it became clear at this pointwe built a secure virtual newsroom.We used encrypted communication systems,Inside the virtual newsroom,that were emerging from the documents.into offshore companies,thereby likely avoiding taxesBut perhaps most exciting of allthat were emerging from the documents --figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine,through his late father, Ian Cameron.such as Wintris Inc.,a company in the British Virgin IslandsI like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson,as the loneliest man in the world.For nine months, he refused paid workand lived off the earnings of his wife.as he worked red-eyed,night after night,month after month.In all that time, he sat on informationthe very issue he's been elected on --"Wintris is coming," he used to say.(Laughter)(Applause)We were big fans of "Game of Thrones."they did so inside the virtual newsroom,official company registers,As we were researching the story,unconnected to us,A new leader was elected in Argentina.The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA,into each one of these unfolding events.Any of one of these journalists,they could have broken the pact.But they didn't.And on April 3 this year,at exactly 8pm German time,(Applause)It was the first of many protests.It was a first of many resignations.They'd been using the addressto register their offshore company.(Laughter)And this dynamic is producingto vast amounts of leaked information.And by sharing resources,we were able to dig deep --because of financial concerns.Now, it was a big risk,and it wouldn't work for every story,but we showed with the Panama PapersTry obtaining a court injunctionTry stopping the inevitable."Wintris has arrived."(Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you.who worked with you, right?The first one is,was there ever a moment when you thoughtthat the leak may be leaked,that the collaboration may just be brokenby somebody publishing a story?that they got to know?We had to calm them down.but instead of responding,were very nervous about this."Calm, remain calm."BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so,GR: We very much believeshould be made public.of the journalists we're working with.is now all available online.BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do.GR: Thank you.(Applause)

traveling to Mars or some distant planet.The travel time could take a yearor even longer.The space on board and the resourceswould be limited.with minimal inputs.and grow crops in a matter of hours?enabling you to feed the entire crewIt involved microorganisms,which are single-celled organisms.And they also used hydrogen from water.to create a nutritious crop,by the astronauts.So why is this important?We need carbon to survive as humans,and we get our carbon from food.On a long space journey,This is a clever solution, right?to address climate change.And we discovered this researcharticles about this work.And we thought it was a really good idea.how to recycle our carbon better.So we had the idea,to our carbon problem here on Earth?We started a company to do it.using these microbes.And we even made a protein-rich mealin some animal proteins.We began cultivating them even further,and we found that we can make oil.or even as a jet fuel.Palm oil is used to manufactureand we're currently working with themto bring some of these products to market.but also beneficial for business.That's what we're doing today.if we take it to the next level.We believe that this type of technologyWell, actually, it is estimatedby 70 percent.So how will we scale to meet that demand?There are a number of reasons why.of greenhouse gases.In fact, it emits more greenhouse gasesthan our cars, our trucks, our planesand our trains combined.What does that look like?Let me give you a specific example.between 2000 and 2012.that was removed in the process,So let me make this real for you.And as I mentioned before,are manufactured using palm oil.It includes cooking oils.in our kitchens and our bathroomsthat were manufactured using palm oil.Modern ag has some problems,These supercharged carbon recyclers,in their ecosystems where they thrive.And they thrive in exotic places on Earth,like hydrothermal vents and hot springs.And they're rich in nutrients,after a long, hard work week,a product of microbes.Or bread, or cheese, or yogurt.These are all products of microbes.versus months.That means we can make cropsmuch faster than we're making them today.They grow in the dark,so they can grow in any seasonand in any geography and any location.that requires so much land,we can scale vertically,Because, at a large scale,over a period of a year.Well, we've already made a protein meal,or even cornmeal, or wheat flour.We've already made oils,or olive oil or soybean oil.that would give us pasta and bread,cakes, nutritional items of many sorts.industrial products and consumer products,using these types of crops.Not only are we running out of space,with modern agriculture,But it doesn't have to be this way.We can imagine a future of abundance.not only from not crashing,Thank you very much.(Applause)

"Mom, who are these people?"around the time when she was three.We were walking along with my husbandin one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.As she tucked in my side,and preserve its unity.Is it because women are not important?"I had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon,who left home at 18 to study abroad.My father didn't have a son,and so I, in a sense, became his.We have had to juggle more than Arab men,lessons that might turn out usefulHere are three of mine.["Convert their sh*t into your fuel."](Laughter)(Applause)resilience.hoping he would notice how great I wasJohn was part of the audienceAs I proceeded with my presentation,I could see John in the corner of my eye.He had turned a dark shade of pinkand we rushed out and jumped into the car.There he exploded."What you did up there was unacceptable!You are a consultant, not an activist!"I said, "John, I don't understand.and some conclusions about the Arab world.He paused, then added,Time stood still for a long while,It's just never going to happen."One, that these were his issues,his complexes.There may be many like him in our society,(Laughter)As I have progressed in my career,So you get this well-meaning coupleor at a friends gathering,But just like I did with John,their complexes.So instead of replying,I gave back one of my largest smilesas I saw, in flashing light,the following sign in my mind's eye.[Be happy, it drives people crazy.](Applause)that are being thrown at you,to let them make you feel like a failure,And it's true what they say:success is the best revenge.Some women in the Middle EastCorrection: I should say "smart enough,"because who you marry is your own choice,It's simply not expected by our society,and even frowned upon as not very manly.of her children and husband.She mostly exists for her family.has to somehow maintain the perfect home,and manage her demanding career.To achieve this, I have found the hard wayYou need to work your life.Here is how I do this in my personal life.One thing to know about the Middle Easton a strong referral.and I make sure to empower herjust like I would my best talent at work.whether an au pair, nursery,Choose very carefully, and empower.If you look at my calendar,you will see every working dayblocked and called "family time."This is sacred time.asking them about their day,Our son Burhan is five years old,Here's another confession:at teaching him these skills than I am.(Laughter)increase Alia's sense of responsibility,and strengthen the bonding between them,a win-win all around.The successful Arab women I knowas they continue to shoulderas a career woman and mother.This is also about being in the present.When I am with my children,I try to leave work out of our lives.moments where I'm seeing my kids,hearing them, connecting with them.["Join forces, don't compete."]in the public eye as they grew up.This explains, I think, to some extent,The upside of this, however,is that we have spent a lot of timein coffee shops, in living rooms,on the phone,networking.I would say the average Arab womanThe majority of those are also women.between professional women.Arab women, generally speaking,Faced with a patriarchal society,all benefit.couldn't bring many benefitsand that I should instead invest my timeshe highlighted my name.She introduced me to a client,Today, I have two senior women on my team,Women continue to advance in the world,not fast enough, but we're moving.for a total of eight female ministers.That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,to convert shit into fuel,and to join forces and not compete.As I look to the future,some 20, 30 years from nowas her father's daughter.My hopes for my sonThank you.(Applause)

Thank you very much. Good evening.that was worth one dollar.And, you see, I had to be paid this dollarso that I would be covered.and I just want to reassure you,that I did get half the money up front.(Laughter)I ended up in Baidoa, Somalia.Journalists called it the "city of death."And they called it the city of death300,000 people,and aid money to the region was drying up.Many aid organizations, unfortunately,had been forced to close their doors.is: What the hell do we do now?and nothing has really changed too much --I went up to a feeding clinic.with this one young woman,I leaned forwardAnd when I did this,She was stiff,She had died hours beforeof malnutrition and dehydration.money she very clearly did not have.And this is a scene that I have confrontedin war zones the world over;Is this just the way the world is?Do you want to know why?Because over 20 years of doing this work,I have come to understandthat there are aspects of this problemthat we can change --not through force or coercion or invasion,instead of war at the expense of peace.How so?Well, I want you to consider this:in circulation in the world today.at every turn.How cheap?Well, in some parts of the world,In many places in which I have worked,And so now the important part:Can anything be done about this?To answer that question,It is a staggering number --more than 40 million people.are in the Global South.Now, let's look at the countriesAnd what do we notice?Well, you see them in green.primarily Western countries.What does this tell us?are living in poor countries,Who does the biggest business?Well, roughly 80 percent of those weaponsof the United Nations Security Council,plus Germany.It's shocking, isn't it?(Laughter)Grade school was spectacular for me.It was, really, a wonderful experience.(Laughter)But you might be saying to yourselves,each and every single day.surely this is a good thing.since the start of the War on Terror.over the past 15 years.in that same period.What do you notice?roughly three- to fourfold.Now, we can have a circular argument hereWhat we should take away from thisfor use by the Iraqi Army,and other militant groups.And therein lies the problem.Because, you see,Spending on war per person per yearnow amounts to about 249 dollars --249 dollars per person,But we can shift that balance.How do we do this?so we can tackle it from both sides.On the supply side,we can push our governmentslike the Arms Trade Treaty,for where their arms are goingand what their arms might be used for.Here in the United States,You know, the curbing of small arms --to make change here.What about on the demand side?who are being lost to war.I have personally seenaround the world.But here's the thing:they take time,please, by all means do it.as how much you give.are a far more effective way of giving,And I know what it meansto lie in bed in the pitch-black nightof automatic gunfire,and wonder with absolute dreadeach and every single day,especially children.Over the years of doing this work,And on at least a couple of occasions,war has very nearly killed me as well.But I firmly believe,that we can make different choices here.Because you see, war is ours,as human beings.We buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it.On the contrary,we are the only ones who can.(Applause)

One day,this ring that belonged to my grandfatherwill pass to my son, Charlie.And I wonder what his generationand perhaps the one that followsMy grandfather was a coal miner.In his time,was accepted.We know now that that is not the caseBut today,because of its impact on the climate --to mobilize 100 billion dollars a yearand transition to using cleaner energy.That promise is already in jeopardy.And that's a real problem,sooner rather than later.Firstly,because greenhouse gases, once released,stay in the atmosphere for decades.And secondly,So for the climate,at just the wrong time.The story need not be this gloomy, though.Three years ago,deployed to save the financial systemto meet other global challenges.When the financial crisis hit in 2008,the central banks of the US and UKthis is money printing by another name.And boy, did they print.This was not done in isolation.In a remarkable act of cooperation,the Special Drawing Right --to boost reserves around the world.When the financial crisis moved to Europe,promised "to do whatever it takes."And they did.In both cases,What this showsCan we print money for climate finance?Three years ago,Once you break down and dismantle the ideathat money is a finite resource,education, health care, welfare --even defense.uncontrolled money printing --leading to hyperinflation.Think: Weimar Republic in 1930;Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008,with printing national currencies.there are some really compelling reasonsthat's issued by the IMF,to fund it.The Special Drawing Right, or SDR,is the IMF's electronic unit of accountlike Bitcoin, but for governments.And it's truly global.These are national stores of wealthAnd that global nature is why,But here --here's the intriguing part.150 billion dollars' worth --because they have flexible exchange rates.weren't really needed.And they remain unused today.So here's an idea.As a first step,to combat climate change?They could, for example,This was a fund created in 2009,to meet their climate projects.raising almost 10 billion dollars.it helps governments get back on track,that was derailed by the financial crisis.It could also --it could also serve as a test case.it could be used to justifyagain, with the commitmentof the new reservesto the Green Climate Fund.over printing national currencies.The first is it's really easy to argueIt's also fair to sayaimed at a global good.And,So, for example,of global foreign exchange reserves.That's important because it would allayin international finance.And in fact,under this schemeis its nickname, the "greenback."Because even with that cap in place,its massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 --So hypothetically,up to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRsto the Green Climate Fund.That's 30 times what it has today.And you know,as spectacular as that sounds,consider this:in 2009,in the past decade.for three whole years.So what could we doorganized on a global scale?So,The real question is:Do we care enough about future generationsAfter all,we could do it,we did do itand we are doing it today.Thank you.(Applause)

Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollarsto the person sitting two rows behind you.before you'd feel comfortable?She's a doctor in Brooklyn,whether they can pay right away or not.or on the sidewalk,for previous appointments.She would thank them,Most of us are like my mom.We would give credit to someone we knowor that we live next to.don't know us on a personal level,but they do have a way of trusting us,and that's through our credit scores.Our credit scores have been createdfrom getting electricity to buying a home,or taking a risk and starting a business.But ...that don't have a credit score.That's a third of the world's population.They don't have a scoreno bank accounts,no credit historiesand no social security numbers.And because they don't have a score,that can improve their lives.They are not trusted.So we wanted to find a way to build trustSo we created a mobile applicationthey're browsing the InternetOur customers give us access to this datain the central business district.or savings group.Jenipher's food stall does well.But she's not financially secure.Any emergency could force her into debt.And she has no discretionary incometo improve her family's way of living,for emergencies,She could get a microloan,to really have an impact on her business,averaging around 150 dollars.Loan sharks are always an option,they're financially risky.But one day,and apply for a loan.And here's what we saw.So, bad news first.These are factorsa much richer picture of her potential.So for one,Well, it turns out that the data showsa four percent increase in repaymentWe could also seeamong customers who are consistentwith where they spend most of their time.and that she had a strong support network.Our data showsIn Jenipher's case,we took the first riskand gave Jenipher a loan.or in any formal financial record.But it proves trust.By looking beyond income,we can see that people in emerging marketsin just the past year.emergencies, travelwhere more people can succeed.I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week,She said,She's lived her whole lifeThank you.(Applause)

[What does this mean?]of the secretive offshore world.go to companies like Mossack Fonsecacan you give us one?"So you actually get to see the emails,you get to see the exchanges of messages,how this operates.We've also had newshas also got offshore companies.via his close childhood friend,who happens to be a top cellist.and the next set of leaked documents.or a John Grisham novel.Why should we care about this?are able to keep their money offshoreand not pay the taxes that they should,like healthcare, education, roads.And that affects all of us.Now, for my organization Global Witness,this exposé has been phenomenal.to hide and disguise their assets --stacked inside another company,who is behind these structures.to really understand what's going on.I also think it's interestingwho are stashing their assets offshore.than you do to get a library card.to rip off schoolchildren.Now, at Global Witness,How does this actually work?So what we didto buy a house, a yacht, a jet.provided our investigator with suggestionson how to move those suspect funds.These were all preliminary meetings,and of course no money moved hands,It's also importantwho's been caught up in a scandal.This is about how a system works,And in order to tackle this,we need to change the game.We need to change the rules of the gameto make this sort of behavior harder.This may seem like doom and gloom,like there's nothing we can do about it,like nothing has ever changed,But as a natural optimist,Over the last couple of years,when it comes to company ownership.This issue was put on the political agendaby the UK Prime Minister David Cameroncentral registers at a national levelin the House and the Senate,this huge peek into the offshore world,We need ordinary people to get angrybehind secret companies.Together, we can end the secrecythat is currently allowing tax evasion,corruption, money laundering to flourish.

He said, "I'm working with three friends,Six months go by,it's the day before the company launches,That's literally all it is."So I obviously declined to invest.(Laughter)They sell glasses online.and valued at over a billion dollars.And now? My wife handles our investments.Why was I so wrong?Originals are nonconformists,people who not only have new ideasbut take action to champion them.They're the people you want to bet on.And they look nothing like I expected.about recognizing originalsand becoming a little bit more like them.Yes, that's an actual term.when you haven't done anything yet.(Laughter)I would wake up at 5am,(Laughter)(Applause)Since then, I have traded hair for teeth.(Laughter)But this served me well in college,(Laughter)So I challenged her to get some data.She goes into a bunch of companies.who rush in and do everything earlyare rated as less creativethan people who procrastinate moderately.(Laughter)No, here are our results.Why is this?To find out, we designed some experiments.and then we get independent readersby dangling Minesweeper in front of themfor either five or 10 minutes.there's no creativity boost.and then you start procrastinating,that you start to incubate.So I metaprocrastinated,I woke up early the next morning(Laughter)And then I worked diligentlyand one day -- I was halfway through --I literally put it away in mid-sentencefor months.It was agony.As Aaron Sorkin put it,And along the way I discoveredTake Leonardo da Vinci.He toiled on and off for 16 yearson the Mona Lisa.He felt like a failure.He wrote as much in his journal.transformed the way that he modeled lightand made him into a much better painter.What about Martin Luther King, Jr.?the March on Washington,he was up past 3am, rewriting it.When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in,he leaves his prepared remarks"I have a dream."That was not in the script.And because the text wasn't set in stone,he had freedom to improvise.but it can be a virtue for creativity.What you see with a lot of great originalsI looked at them and said,They missed the first-mover advantage.trying to figure out how to get peopleto be comfortable ordering glasses online.until after Myspace and Friendster.You just have to be different and better.They were also full of doubts.They had backup plans lined up,(Laughter)Now, on the surface,a lot of original people look confident,but behind the scenes,They just manage it differently.Let me show you: this is a depiction(Laughter)There's self-doubt and idea doubt.Self-doubt is paralyzing.It leads you to freeze.But idea doubt is energizing.just like MLK did.And so the key to being originalis just a simple thingInstead of saying, "I'm crap,"and I'm just not there yet."So how do you get there?Well, there's a clue, it turns out,in the Internet browser that you use.just by knowing what web browser you use.(Laughter)Yes.(Applause)Why? It's not a technical advantage.It's about how you got the browser.those came preinstalled on your computer,(Laughter)No, it's about being the kind of personand look for a better option.And if you do that well,(Laughter)She rewrites the first act,reinvents the villain as a tortured heroWhen you feel doubt, don't let it go.(Laughter)What about fear?Originals feel fear, too.They're afraid of failing,or by failing to start a business at all.but our inactions.are the chances not taken.He was sure the first few SpaceX launchesbut it was too important not to try.we don't bother to try.But I have some good news for you.A lot of people think they will.If you look across industriestons of them, in fact.Take the guy who invented this.(Laughter)If you look across fields,because they're the ones who try the most.One of the best predictorsNow, you may be wondering,I don't know how Wagner pulled that off.we have to generate more ideas.to build a retail brand,and they tested over 2,000 possibilitiesbefore they finally put togetherWarby and Parker.They have bad ideas.that they succeed.Don't write them off.can boost your creativity,and embracing the fear of failing to try,Look, being original is not easy,but I have no doubt about this:Thank you.(Applause)



knut_haanaes_two_reasons_companies_fail_and_how_to_avoid_them
1561133

Here are two reasons companies fail:they only do more of the same,or they only do what's new.exploration and exploitation.Both are necessary,but it can be too much of a good thing.Consider Facit.I'm actually old enough to remember them.Facit was a fantastic company.They were born deep in the Swedish forest,Everybody used them.They continued doing exactly the same.and they were gone.Gone.To me, the irony about the Facit storyis hearing about the Facit engineers,(Laughter)Facit did too much exploitation.But exploration can go wild, too.A few years back,Let's call them OncoSearch.The company was brilliant.certain forms of blood cancer.They were extremely innovative,or even, "We want it perfect."The sad thing is,before they became perfect --even good enough --they became obsolete.OncoSearch did too much exploration.The founder of the idea is Jim March.Exploration.It's about search,it's about discovery,it's about new products,it's about new innovations.It's about changing our frontiers.Madame Curie,Picasso,Neil Armstrong,Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.I come from Norway;We all know that exploration is risky.We don't know the answers,we don't know if we're going to find them,and we know that the risks are high.Exploitation is the opposite.and making good, better.Exploitation is not risky --in the short term.But if we only exploit,it's very risky in the long term.That's the risk of exploitation.Small children, they explore all day.All day it's about exploration.As we grow older,The same goes for companies.as they become more competent.For example,Or, "How can I make sureor are hit by a crisis?"So, doing one well is difficult.Doing both well as the same time is art --pushing both exploration and exploitation.So one thing we've foundand exploit at the same time, in parallel.But when they do,the payoffs are huge.So we have lots of great examples.We have Nestlé creating Nespresso,we have Lego going into animated films,Toyota creating the hybrids,Unilever pushing into sustainability --Why is balancing so difficult?that keep us where we are.We discover something,to get at it and make it work.But the same goes for that,then we're in the vicious circleOncoSearch was a good example.A famous example is, of course, Xerox.But we don't only see this in companies.We see this in the public sector as well.research, health care, even defense,takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.But still, we change much more often.We really don't give them the chance.Another trap is the success trap.Facit fell into the success trap.but they couldn't see it.that they wouldn't change.We are like that, too.Bill Gates has said:"Success is a lousy teacher.That's the challenge with success.And they apply to our companies.And any company that's able to innovatewith earlier generations of distribution,keep pushing for the next battle.I see other companies that say,Second one: think in multiple time scales.I'll share a chart with you,and I think it's a wonderful one.Any company we look at,taking a one-year perspectiveSo when we think one year,innovation isn't really that important.But companies can't choose.Third:invite talent.I don't think it's possible for any of usI think it's a team sport.I think we need to allow challenging.Last one: be skeptical of success.when the generals, after a big victory,were given their celebration.Riding into Rome on the carriage,"Remember, you're only human."So I hope I made the point:balancing exploration and exploitationhas a huge payoff.of falling into success traps,of just going on autopilot?And what can you do to challenge?Second question is:When did I explore something new last,and what kind of effect did it have on me?Is that something I should do more of?In my case, yes.So let me leave you with this.Whether you're an explorer by natureThank you.(Applause)

I call them relaunchers.for childcare reasons,pursuing a personal interestor a personal health issue.veterans, military spouses,retirees coming out of retirementor repatriating expats.and the relaunchers.as a high-risk proposition,to relaunch their careers,This is Sami Kafala.He's a nuclear physicist in the UKafter long career breaks.And speaking of long career breaks,this is Mimi Kahn.after a 25-year career break.Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connorbut having a difficult time of it.because she loved working.Tracy was doing what so many of us doand applying for jobs with no results.I met Tracy in June of 2011,that don't go anywhere.There will be a handfulwhen I was returning to workthey are going to remember you as you werebefore your career break.as happens with so many of usas someone who looks like this.Or here I am in the kitchen.But those people from the past,they don't know about any of this.They only remember you as you were,My background is in finance,and I hardly kept up with any newsSo I was afraid I'd go into an interviewand here's why.Think about our life stage:we have fewer or no maternity leaves.We did that already.We're in a more settled time of life.We have great work experience.We have a more mature perspective.On the flip side, I speak with employers,about hiring relaunchers.are technologically obsolete.Now, I can tell you,that it's a temporary condition.but I had to relearn it on Excel.I found PowerPoint much more challenging,but now I use PowerPoint all the time.And if they're not up to speed,And they do.or have not changedwhile they have been on career break.That's not the employer's job.where they can add the most value.Back in 2010 I started noticing something.and in 2010, I started noticingbut an internship-like experience,I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Leeand then get a permanent job afterward.called "The 40-Year-Old Intern."and also for this artworkAnd then, courtesy of Fox Business News,(Laughter)These internships are paid,are commanding competitive salaries.Because the internship allows the employerinstead of a series of interviews,until the internship period is over.who are turning into great hires.Think about how far we have come.in engaging with relaunchers at all.specifically with relaunchers in mind,unless you have a gap on your résumé.This is the mark of real change,of true institutional shift,In fact, an employer just told methat their veterans return to work programDifferent pool, same concept.about her interest in returning to work.led to a job offer for Tracy,But it was a temp job.This was in the fall of 2011.So even though she had a second job offerand hope for the best.at the beginning of 2012,because they knew what Tracy could handle.Fast forward to 2015,Tracy's been promoted.Tracy's temp job was a tryout,just like an internship,to more and more employers.But in the meantime,Be their first success story,Thank you.(Applause)

I come from one of the most liberal,Seattle, Washington.and I am truly grateful for my upbringing,exactly as I saw fit.And in point of fact,When I was 19, I dropped out of college --dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.(Laughter)which was my lifelong dream.and I toured for a couple of yearsAnd by the end of my 20s,What a great life.And you know, my parents never complained.They supported me all the way through it.It wasn't their dream."Our son, he's taking a gap decade."(Laughter)And --that I want to tell you about.I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona,And she was quiet, too quiet.Something was wrong.And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"have you been voting for Republicans?"(Laughter)Now, the truth is,But I had a bit of an epiphany,and I want to tell you why that is.It stems from a lifelong interest of minein, believe it or not, poverty.That's not even close.of a kid who was my age in East Africa,Some of you remember that picture,and I dropped out and dropped inand started my family.And I wondered, what happened to that kid?I was looking for the answer:and I want to share it with you.See --But here's the truth.From 1970 until today,the percentage of the world's populationliving in starvation levels,that percentage has declinedby 80 percent.since I was a kid.And I didn't even know about it.This, my friends, that's a miracle.That's something we ought to celebrate.and it happened in our lifetimes.(Applause)If you want to replicate ithave been pulled out of poverty.And I went in search of an answer.You know what, I still don't care.left, right and center.And here it is.Here are the reasons.Number one: globalization.Number two: free trade.Number three: property rights.Number four: rule of law.Number five: entrepreneurship.after 1970 that did that.Now, I'm not naive.I know that free enterprise isn't perfect,to build a better world.But that is great.And that's beyond politics.Capitalism is not just about accumulation.At its best, it's about aspiration,is the aspiration that comes from dreamsthat's related to that first onebut right here at home.The best quote I've ever heardabout pulling people out of povertyis as follows:They have lifted billions out of poverty."Who said it?Wrong.President Barack Obama said that.Why do I know it by heart?Because he said it to me.Crazy.And I said, "Hallelujah."But more than that, I said,"What an opportunity."You know what I was thinking?at Georgetown University in May of 2015.And I thought, this is the solutionIt's coming together around these ideas,liberals and conservatives,to help people who need us the most.It's risen to critical, crisis levels.It's unpleasant. It's not right.There was an article last yearpublished in the West.And it was an article in 2014on political motive asymmetry.It's common in world conflict.What the authors of this article foundsuffer from political motive asymmetry.Think about it. Think about it.Most people are walking around saying,I want to help people,It's impossible.How do we solve it?There's a lot of good research on this.to see how they differ.For example, Jon Haidt has shownthat liberals care about povertyIrreconcilable differences, right?We'll never come together. Wrong.Remember what pulled up the poor.It was the obsession with poverty,spreading around the world.We need each other, in other words,There's no other way.Hmm.How are we going to get that?It's a tricky thing, isn't it.We need innovative thinking.A lot of it's on this stage.We need investment overseasBut you know what we really need?We need a new day in flexible ideology.We need to be less predictable.Don't we?Kinda conventional?Why is that dangerous?on the right, conservatives,it's always about income inequality.Right? Now those are important things,But when it comes to lifting people upand their obsession with poverty,if we choose to take it.Number one. Action item number one:It's not good enough.who are still waiting for these tools.Where does this start? It starts here.then maybe people will listen.Maybe progress will start at that point.That's number one. Number two.who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.If you're a conservative,when we use them responsibly.If we do that, we get two things.and turn it into a competition of ideasbased on solidarity and mutual respect.And then maybe, just maybe,we'll all realize that our big differencesaren't really that big after all.Thank you.(Applause)

I want to tell you the storyabout the time I almost got kidnappedin the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.and I'm having a yard sale.And this guy pulls up in this red Mazdaand he starts looking through my stuff.And he buys a piece of art that I made.driving cross-country on a road tripbefore he goes into the Peace Corps.So I invite him out for a beerand he tells me all about his passionfor making a difference in the world.Now it's starting to get late,and I'm getting pretty tired.As I motion for the tab,I make the mistake of asking him,"So where are you staying tonight?"And he makes it worse by saying,"Actually, I don't have a place."And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"What do you do?We've all been there, right?Do I offer to host this guy?But, I just met him -- I mean,he says he's going to the Peace Corps,That's a small trunk!So then I hear myself saying,And the voice in my head goes,"Wait, what?"That night, I'm laying in bed,I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,"Oh my god, what have I done?What if he's psychotic?"My anxiety grows so much,I leap out of bed,I sneak on my tiptoes to the door,and I lock the bedroom door.It turns out he was not psychotic.We've kept in touch ever since.This was my first hosting experience,and it completely changed my perspective.and when I moved to San Francisco,I brought the airbed with me.So now it's two years later.I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,and all the hotels are sold out.is the gift of creativity.sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.Ha!"Three lucky guests got to stayBut they loved it, and so did we.the door latch clicked,Brian and I just stared at each other.while also making rent?The wheels had started to turn.My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,joined as engineering co-founder.And we buckled down to seeif we could turn this into a business.Here's what we pitched investors:"We want to build a websitetheir bedrooms, the bathrooms --And then, over the Internet,It's going to be huge!"(Laughter)It did not.Why?and all we really knew was design.We learned to do that for objects,between people who had never met.Could design make that happen?Is it possible to design for trust?that we were aiming to achieve.I've got a 30-second experimentthat will push you past your comfort zone.If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.OK, I need you to take out your phones.Now that you have your phone out,I'd like you to unlock your phone.(Laughter)(Laughter)is your home.People don't just see your messages,they see your bedroom,your kitchen, your toilet.Most of us feel really responsible.By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?(Laughter)(Laughter)(Applause)OK, you can hand your phones back now.we were facing,What if we changed one small thingabout the design of that experiment?(Laughter)It turns out,It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.left the review before we reveal them.We did a joint study with Stanford,The research showed, not surprisingly,we prefer people who are like us.The more different somebody is,the less we trust them.Now, that's a natural social bias.But what's interesting is what happenswhen you add reputation into the mix,in this case, with reviews.nothing changes.But if you've got more than 10,everything changes.High reputation beats high similarity.one of our most deeply rooted biases.takes the right amount of disclosure.If you share too little, like, "Yo,"acceptance rates go down.And if you share too much, like,"I'm having issues with my mother,"(Laughter)acceptance rates also go down.But there's a zone that's just right,We bet our whole companyon the hope that,with the right design,What we didn't realizeis just how many peopleThere's three things happening here.The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.The second is the efforts of our team.Now, things have been going pretty well.Guests have thrown unauthorized partiesand trashed homes.In the early days, I was customer service,it hurts to even think about them.was and, I would say, still isAnd when trust works out right,it can be absolutely magical.and he suffered a heart attack.The host rushed him to the hospital.Let me read you his review.(Laughter)"Excellent house for sedentary travelersprone to myocardial infarctions.(Laughter)(Laughter)Highly recommended!"(Applause)Of course, not every stay is like that.But this connection beyond the transactionNow, when I heard that term,I have to admit, it tripped me up.So let's be clear; it is about commerce.it would be incomplete.People share a part of themselves,and that changes everything.You know how most travel today is, like,I think of it like fast food --it's efficient and consistent,at the cost of local and authentic.of local experiences?What if anywhere you visited,there was a central marketplace of localsoffering to get you thoroughly drunkWhat would that look like?instead of isolation and separation.In South Korea, in the city of Seoul,they've actually even started this.to be shared by residents.with empty-nesters who have extra rooms.of sharing economy start-ups.Tonight, just on our service,785,000 peoplein 191 countrieswill either stay in a stranger's homeor welcome one into theirs.We didn't invent anything new.Hospitality has been around forever.So, why did ours eventually take off?Luck and timing aside,and you can design for that.Design can overcome our most deeply rootedstranger-danger bias.And that's amazing to me.It blows my mind.But if it can help out with this one,if it can make a dent in this,Thank you.(Applause)

There we were,on the last night of our lives.Packed into a room just like this,A room like this, nonetheless.With the same great feelings of suspense,the same deep hopes for salvation,the same sweat in the palms(Laughter)This was December 31, 1999,the night of the Second Coming of Christ,and the end of the world as I knew it.I had turned 12 that yearand had reached the age of accountability.And once I stopped complainingSo I went to church as often as I could.and decided to come back early.And just in case he did,I built a backup plan,And I found in their pagesI had another shot.It would be hard --(Laughter)but I knew I could do it.(Laughter)But planning time was over now.It was 11:50pm.We had 10 minutes left,So every faction of the congregationtook its place.The choir stayed in the choir stand,the deacons and their wives --(Laughter)took first position in front of the altar.You see, in America,(Laughter)(Applause)And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisiewere the elderly --in the cotton fields of East Texas,just like the clay of East Texas,outside of East Texashad sometimes been bent and brokeneven further than their backs.And as she made her way to the altar,I snuck right in behind her,because I knew for surethat my grandmother was going to heaven.I might go right on with her.So I held onand I closed my eyesto listen,to wait.And the prayers got louder.went up higher even still.And the heat came on to add to the sweat.And my hand gripped firmer,My eyes clenched tighterAnd then a voice rang out above us:"Amen."It was over.I looked at the clock.It was after midnight.I looked at the elder believerswhose savior had not come,who had believed too much and for too longto start doubting now.But I was upset on their behalf.They had been duped,hoodwinked, bamboozled,and I had gone right along with them.I had prayed their prayers,I had dipped my head not once, but twicein that snot-inducing baptism pool.I had believed.Now what?as it rolled in around the world.for Jesus to come back again and againbased on the different time zones.(Laughter)hurt, really.I just believed a new thing:that it was possible not to believe.that the questions themselves were wrong.a spring of doubt,a spring that promised rivers.I can trace the whole drama of my lifeback to that night in that churchwhen my savior did not come for me;when the thing I believed most certainlyturned out to be, if not a lie,then not quite the truth.I'm convinced that you are heresince the dawn of this new century,and my Lord refused to come.And I held out my hand,reaching for something to believe in.I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,with my face planted in the floor,my hands tied behind my backand a burglar's gun pressed to my head,as an intern in 2008.(Laughter)So hopeful --(Laughter)that I called home to inform my familythat we'd never be poor again.(Laughter)But as I witnessed this temple of financecome crashing down before my eyes,saying, "It's been a long time coming,But as the Congress ground to a haltand the country ripped at the seamscould not save me.praying to the gods of my timeof success,and money,and power.But over and over again,midnight struck, and I opened my eyesto see that all of these gods were dead.And from that graveyard,I began the search once more,not because I was brave,or I would die.Harvard Business School --(Laughter)that it claimed to offer.No, I knew there'd be more work to do.when three friends and I asked a questionfor a very long time:"What if we took a road trip?"(Laughter)but we knew we had to do it.and go find out what everybody was doingall over the country.we went on anyhow.through the swamps of New Orleans,who were building small businessesthat made purpose their bottom line.this struck us as a revolutionary idea.(Laughter)And this idea spread,for purpose, for meaning.in the nooks and crannies of Americawho were creating jobs and changing livesand who needed a little help.But if I'm being honest, it also spreadbecause I fought to spread it.to preach this gospel,to get more people to believeone social business at a time.But it was this journey of evangelismthat led me to the rather different gospelthat I've come to share with you today.It began one evening almost a year agoUnder a full-size replica of a whale,I sat with the titans of our timeThere was pride in a roomsurpassed half a trillion dollars.We looked over all that we had made,and it was good.(Laughter)But it just so happened,two days later,I had to travel up the road to Harlem,that had once been a vacant lot,that showed up there every day.All of them lived below the poverty line.Some of them came to Tony's program,called Harlem Grown,to get the only meal they had each day.after 20 years as a cab driver.He told me that he would take any helpthat he could get.And I was there as that help.welling up in my eyes.I felt the weight of revelationthat I could sit in one room on one night,and another room, two days later,just 50 blocks up the road,where a man was going without a salaryto get a child her only meal of the day.it wasn't rage toward the one percentor pity toward the 99.that I was the dialysiseven if they didn't have any boots;that my organization stood inor Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward;And the shame of that,that shame washed over meagainand againand again.I had been duped,hoodwinked,bamboozled.But this time, the false savior was me.from a world where people spoke in tonguesand took a text to be infallible truth.Yes, I've come so farthat I'm right back where I started.Because it simply is not true to saythat we live in an age of disbelief --or Tony Robbins.or the Harvard Business Review.We may believe most deeplybut we desperately want to believe,we need to believe.that promise to solve all our problems.we take the text of technological progressto be infallible truth.when we fail to question one brick,But if you are disturbedthen it must be questioning time.or a triple bottom line.I have and I offer a gospel of doubt.it asks that you believe a new thing:that it is possible not to believe.on this stage, in this room,are wrong.Because it raises the question, "Why?"why are people still suffering so bad?MBAs Across America,out of business.and we will share our model freelywithout waiting for our permission.This doubt compels meto renounce the role of saviorthat some have placed on me,to wait for second comings,And this doubt, it fuels me,it gives me hopethat when our troubles overwhelm us,it will not be our blind faith --no, it will be our humble doubtand of our worldand lets us raise our voice to whisperor to shoutor to say simply,very simply,"There must be another way."Thank you.(Applause)



travis_kalanick_uber_s_plan_to_get_more_people_into_fewer_cars

by getting more people into fewer cars;And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ...not self-driving cars.And if it had survived,So let me introduce you to the jitney.my hometown,and he saw trolleysthat was slang for a nickel.And so people jumped on board,And within one year,by 1915,45,000 rides per day in Kansasand 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.To give you some perspective,Uber in Los Angelesis doing 157,000 rides per day, today ...100 years later.And so these are the trolley guys,And so they got to workand they went to cities across the countryAnd there were all kinds of regulations.In some cities,if you were a jitney driver,In other cities,install it in every Jitney --(Laughter)All right. So what happened?That's unfortunate ...And car ownership skyrocketedand it's no wonder that by 2007,And that phenomenon had gone global.In China by 2011,wasted, sitting in traffic.160 billion dollars in lost productivity,of course also sitting in traffic,Because if you have to own a caris used storing these hunks of steel.We even have skyscrapers built for cars.That's the world we live in today.It's called mass transit.And even in a city like New York City,Why is that?how to get to everybody's doorstep.the situation's much worse,in fact, much worse around the world.We didn't have any grand ambitions.But it just turned outWe saw a lot of peoplepushing the same button at the same timegoing essentially to the same place.And so we started thinking about,up to 50 percent cheaper --and of course for the cityAnd so the big question for us was:would it work?Could you have a cheaper rideIn San Francisco,before uberPOOL, we had --And once we introduced uberPOOL,taking cars off the road.It looks like uberPOOL is working.And so we rolled it out in Los Angeleseight months ago.But the part that I'm really --(Applause)But my favorite statistic --remember, I'm from LA,I spent years of my lifeNow, in China everything is supersized,that's 500,000 per day.In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.How do we get that to a million?But what about the suburbs?and, well --And every morning at about the same time,cars roll of out their driveway,most of them, one person in the car,So the question for us is:well, how do we turnall of these commuter cars --go to your carand you light up the Uber app,and all of a sudden,you become an Uber driver.on your way to workand it's a really great thing.There's just one hitch ...it's called regulation.So 54 cents a mile, what is that?Well, that is what the US governmentfor 54 cents a mile or less.But what if for 60 cents a mileAnd what if at 60 cents a mileIf we could,it's obviously something we should do.If by 1915 this thing was taking off,if that thing could just keep going.How would our cities be different today?Well, we lost that chance.to make our new cities a reality?With the technology in our pockets today,and a little smart regulation,we can turn every car into a shared car,Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Travis, thank you.Travis Kalanick: Thank you.a powerful part --it's cool.But I've got a couple other questionsSo first of all, last week I think it was,and I couldn't find the app.TK: Sure.CA: How did it go?well, what we were trying to accomplish.it makes a lot more sense.Which is, when we first got started,it was just black cars.And so what we didthat looked like a badge on a luxury car.And as we've gone worldwideto be more accessible,to be more hyperlocal,to be about the cities we were inAnd to be more iconic,and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin.I mean, your hands are sweating,you've got --you know, you're a little worried.What we saw is a lot of people --CA: OK, that's cool.believe that the only chanceof taxi industry and so forth,which you've certainly proved to be.Did you notice a loss of business?Did you learn anything from that?TK: Well, look, I think --and you have --and for us,it was about a year and a half ago,and for us it was hard times, too.Now, inside, we felt like --I guess at the end of the daybut on the outside that wasn't evident.And so there was a lot that we had to doto sort of --We'd gone from a very small company --our company was 400 people,and today it's 6,500.And so when you go through that growth,and talk about them all of the time.And if you check those boxes,And I think we learned a lot of lessonsBut it was certainly a difficult period.CA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn,How --This thing's taken off,I mean -- who are you?Do you want that?(Laughter)First is on the pricing side --I mean, keep in mind, right?UberX, when we first started,It's nowin many cities, half the price of a taxi.And we have all the data to showWhat happens is when the price goes down,people are more likely to take Uberand actually, earnings come up.So even in New York --compare the earningsSeptember after September after September.Same month every year.And we see the earnings going up over timeas the price comes down.but we don't see those earnings pop,we bring the prices back up.So that addresses that first part.And then the enigma and all of this --I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I amthat's a really sad math professor.And so at Uber we like the hard problemsBut we don't want just any math problem,and we want the one that if you solve it,there's a little bit of a wow factor.CA: In a couple years' time --say five years' time, I don't know when --CA: What do you say to a driver?it's likely going to take a lot longerThat's part one.Part two is it's going to also take --there's going to be a long transition.Because, well --A million people die a year in cars.when you give people their time backand it's not so anxiety-ridden.So I think there's a lot of good.but one for optimistic leadership,Where instead of resisting --resisting technology,Are there ways to partner with cities?for that transition period.especially that transition period.But it is a world that's going to exist,and it is going to be a better world.(Applause)

I believe big institutionshave unique potential to create change,and I believe that we as individualshave unique powerbecause trusting big institutions,not really part of my family legacy.My mother escaped North Koreawhen she was 10 years old.repressive governments, occupying armiesand even armed border patrols.she had to defy an entire cultureto come to the United States.Because of her bravery and passion,and that has made my story so different.I've actually run toward them.to work for The Wall Street Journal,the White Housewhere I lead sustainable investing.Now, these institutions are like tankers,and working inside of them,and I've become convincedif we ask it to be.Now, I know some of you are thinking,kind of like an ocean.or retirement accounts can dodon't affect the tides,But why is that?actually belongs to individuals like us,and their capital from us,Why can't we make some waves?So let me ask you a different question:did any of you buy fair trade coffeeOK. Do any of you go to the restaurantand order the sustainably farmed troutthat you really wish you could have?So why do we do these things?combustion engine vehicles.One fish is just one fish in the sea.And one cup of coffeethat our actions add up,that our choices might influence others"This one cup helps save the planet."(Laughter)So why do we think that our choicein a reusable mug matters,for our IRA doesn't?that we care,that we care about fair labor standards,and about healthy communities?but we would vote with our lattes?it would fill up with sweet porridge.And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop,"it would stop.and things could go terribly awry.So I think when it comes to markets,that obeys only one command:make more money.Only those words said exactly that waywill make the pot fill up with gold.the spell might not work.and you might see your gold coins shrinkand we found something fascinating.Overwhelmingly,71 percent of people said yes,that you already have traditionally71 percent wanted that.would actually do better financially.But here was the weird thing:54 percent of the peopleSo is it true?instead of drinking it?or Ben &amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so.for hundreds of millions of dollarseach.But here's the important thing.Those corporations realizedthose brands wouldn't make more money.they need to stick to making more money.and they found something fascinating.If you had invested a dollar 20 years agoin a portfolio of companiesthat focused narrowly on making more moneyquarter by quarter,that one dollarThat's not bad until you considerin a portfolio of companiesthat focused on growing their businessthat one dollar would have grownto 28 dollars and 36 cents.almost twice as much sweet porridge.like wasting less energy and waterin their manufacturing processes;not just quarterly results;or building a first class culturethat would have higher employee loyalty,retention and productivity.Now, Harvard's not alone.lower cost of capitalAnd then there's Al Gore.right into the core investment process.Far from making less sweet porridgeNow, sustainable investing,and it's not just for the elite.or microfinance in emerging marketsor artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn.It's about mutual funds.It's about all the thingswe already see in the market today.So here's why I'm convincedthat we collectively have the powerthat sustainable investing done right,the traditional sphere, can pay.It makes sense.Secondly,the biggest obstacle standing in our waymay actually just be in our heads.We just need to let go of that myththat you get less sweet porridge.And once you get rid of the fable,And third, the future is already here.So what are we waiting for?She knew that she wanted a lifeShe was passionate about that goalno big institution stand in her way.She made it to the States,and she became a teacher,an award-winning authorand a mother,It seems almost too propheticthat her name in Korean means"passionate clarity."Passionate clarity:to make choices.So change your perspective.Vote with your small change.Change the fablesand change the markets.Thank you.(Applause)

the Dutch.It hasn't always been this way.In the last 150 years,in developed countries,but almost all of them involve nutrition,namely the increase of dairy and meat.In the last 50 years,from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.which means that by 2050,than what is available to humankind today.by the end of this century, at 11 billion,This challenge is staggering --so much so, that recently,and food production systems,At the same time,than the oceans can naturally replace.such as swordfish and bluefin tuna,But ultimately,It's unlikely,even with the best-managed fisheries,than we do today.We need to alleviate the pressure on it.And we are at a pointwe might face total collapse.So how do we fix this?We could all become vegan.Sounds like a great idea,but it's not realisticAnd suppose we fail to change our waysand continue on the current path,failing to meet demands.It takes very little imaginationPeople are hungry,For so, so many reasons,We must do betterand there is a solution.And that solution lies in aquaculture --Fish is the last food that we hunt."Life's too short for farmed fish,"or, "Wild-caught, of course!"And if it was a large predatory species,We don't know.Very few people realizethat caught the wild animal.But let's back up for a secondIt's healthy,it prevents heart disease,it provides key amino acidsand key fatty acids like Omega-3s,And aside from being healthy,it's also a lot more exciting and diverse.Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig,but that's beside that point.I know I sound fish-obsessed --(Laughter)Let me explain:in aquaculture a couple of years ago.We were inspired by Sylvia Earle,who won the TED Prize in 2009.Amy was there as the TED Prize Director;love to dive, passion for the oceans.Mission Blue truly changed our lives.We fell in love,got marriedand we came away really inspired,something that was meant to last,that could make a real differenceand something that we could do together.realize what was going onand to really get involvedbecause aquaculture has the potentialWe were stunned when we heard the statsAnd to talk about stats --wild catch and farmed combined,produced on planet earth last year.Every single fishing vessel combined,small and large, across the globe,for human consumption.Aquaculture this year,for the first time in history,But now this:Demand is going to go up.In the next 35 years,An enormous number.It needs to come from farming.And talk about farming --for farming you need resources.so does an animal.and drink almost 8,000 liters of waterto create just one pound of meat.Experts agree that it's impossibleWe just don't have enough feed or water.We need something more efficientto keep humankind alive on this planet.and depending on species, even less.And why is that?And most fish are cold-blooded --they don't need to heat themselves.Fish chills.(Laughter)And it needs very little water,which is counterintuitive,but as we say,it swims in it but it hardly drinks it.aside from insects.How much we've learned since.for human consumption,that's turned into fish meal and fish oil.This is madness.It's destroying our oceans.Recently, an article came out of Stanfordwould stop using fish meal,our oceans would be saved.Now think about that for a minute.coral reef destruction and so on.Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation,climate change, food security and so on.In the search for alternatives,the industry, on a massive scale,has reverted to plant-based alternativeslike soy, industrial chicken waste,blood meal from slaughterhousesand so on.but this is not the right approach.It's not sustainable,it's not healthy.Of course not.If you feed salmon soy with nothing else,it literally explodes.Salmon is a carnivore,it has no way to digest soy.Now, fish farming is by farBut it's had a really bad reputation.There's been excessive use of chemicals,ecosystem destruction and pollution,altering the overall genetic pool,and then of course, as just mentioned,the unsustainable feed ingredients.How blessed were the dayswhatever it was.Once you know, you know.You can't go back.It's not fun.that produces healthy food.But the good news isthat decades of development and researchthat allow us to do a lot better.New technologies meanswith a minimal footprintHealthy for the people,healthy for the fish,healthy for the planet.Microbes, for example,at scale.Insects are the --well, first of all, the perfect recyclingbecause they're grown on food waste;but second,think of fly-fishing,You don't need large tracts of land for itThis revolution is starting as we speak,it just needs scale.I imagine, for example,with little or no effluent,almost no energy and almost no wateroff of each other,mimicking nature.You need very little feed,very little footprint.From alternatives to battle diseaseso we can improve farm practices.So somebody needs to connect the dotsrethinking everything from the ground up,alongside great entrepreneursThis industry

is the defining challenge of our time.Of course there are other challenges --environmental challengesand, of course, radicalized terrorism.However,it will take us a long wayMore importantly,unless and until we solve economic growthwe'll be unable to addressThe fundamental question is this:How are we going to create economic growthat a time when they continue to struggleThey continue to underperformcapital, labor and productivity.In particular,and they also see productivity stalling.In a similar vein,and where, on average,In these countries,in order to put a dent in povertyAnd yet today,the largest emerging economies --Worse than that,and, in many cases, actually regressing.Economic growth matters.With economic growth,If growth wanes,the risk to human progressThe context matters.And countries in emerging marketsThere are some people hereby what's happened around the worldbefore it plateaus in 2100,And you worry about how man,embodied in the corporate globalist,has become greedy and corrupt.of millions of people around the world.And more importantly,is that the factors of production,but what has happened to capitalism.Economic growth needs capitalism,but it needs it to work properly.And as I mentioned a moment ago,Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.When in practical experience,capitalism is much more of a spectrum.And we have countries such as China,which are more market capitalist.This is really importantbecause this type of capitalismthat it is now fostering corruptionand, worse still,it's increasing income inequality --is how can we fix capitalismso that it can help create economic growthhow does capitalism work today?Very simplistically,do they then decide it's importantbut also to be arbiter of social goods.But nevertheless,this framework --this two-stage framework --is the basis from which we must now startFirst of all,we can draw on the right-wing policiesto see what could be beneficial for usIn particular,right-leaning policiesFor example,sending children to school,parents could earn money for that,parents could get paid for doing that.Now, quite apart from the debateto do what we think they should do anyway,has actually yielded some positive resultsin places like Mexico,in Braziland also in pilot programs in New York.But there are also benefitsso that it's not so narrowly definedof the factors of productionBut also we've started to have debatesabout how the role of the private sectoralbeit small in scale,are moving in that right direction.when the infrastructure rolloutMore recently, of course,My fundamental message to you is this:about what might work.Ultimately,Thank you.(Applause)by saying growth is also an ideology,and improvements in living standards.And so I think that we should be openbut the only way for that happento take us on a long journey,is for economic growthDo you see that happening?I think if we start to constrain ourselvesthat we know today,we could get quite negativeHowever, we've seen the Club of Rome,we've seen previous claimsI think we could reinvest in energy,And so in that sense,BG: The thing that strikes meand taking a different directionIs that what you're suggesting?I think it is absolutely the casethat traditional models of economic growthAnd I think it's no accidenthas democracy,and it has free market capitalism --to the extent that it is free --The second largest economy is China.It has deprioritized democracyand completely different economic models,measured as a Gini coefficient.because it's not clear at allwhat model we should be adopting,If you could send a tweetwhat would you say?As you're aware,have been on the agenda many times now --and we keep revisiting these issuesin fact there's a schismand what emerging market countries want.Developed countries recognizebut also as trendsetters in R&amp;D.But in essence, it cannot be a situationwithout developed countries themselves(Applause)

Democracy.In the West,We see democracyIt doesn't.have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubtspectacular growth,while politics remains democracy-free.here in Europe.the newly elected Greek government --in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,our elections --could not be allowed to interfereAt that moment,or the Chinese Communist Party,Tonight, here, I want to present to youthat Lee Kuan Yew,the Chinese Communist Partyand indeed the EurogroupAnd without democracy,our societies will be nastier,our future bleakand our great, new technologies wasted.Speaking of waste,I call it the twin peaks paradox.One peak you understand --you know it, you recognize it --We all recognize the mountain of debts.But few people discern its twin.A mountain of idle cashtoo terrified to invest itlike green energy.Now let me give you two numbers.Over the last three months,on all the wealth-producing goods --things like industrial plants, machinery,office blocks, schools,$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of moneyuntil you compare it to the $5.1 trillionin our financial institutions,The result is stagnant wages,out of work.And consequently, low aggregate demand,which in a never-ending cycle,reinforces the pessimism of the investors,exactly like Oedipus' father,that his son would grow up to kill him,unwittingly engineered the conditionsThis is my quarrel with capitalism.Its gross wastefulness,all this idle cash,should be energized to improve lives,to develop human talents,green technologies,I believe so,but before we move on,what do we mean by democracy?Aristotle defined democracybeing in the majority, control government.But it would be a mistakeon the basis of whom it excluded.What was more pertinent,was the inclusion of the working poor,but more importantly, crucially,that were afforded equal weightAnd indeed,They have their roots in the Magna Carta,in the 1688 Glorious Revolution,indeed in the American constitution.and empowering the working poor,leaving the economic sphere --the corporate world, if you want --as a democracy-free zone.Now, in our democracies today,the moment it started happening,eating into its power.(Laughter)which is separate.Indeed,If you think about it,that in the end they starve.Similarly,causing economic crisis.Corporate power is increasing,political goods are devaluing,inequality is rising,aggregate demand is fallingthe taller the twin peaksand humanity's wealth.Clearly, if this is right,or the exclusion of women and migrants.Now, this is not an original idea.and it didn't go very well, did it?as they were in ancient Athens,But there is a solution:eliminate the working poor.Capitalism's doing itThe problem isautomation makes the twin peaks taller,the waste loftierand the social conflicts deeper,including --soon, I believe --in places like China.So we need to reconfigure,(Laughter)The more interesting questionwhere machines serve the humansI think we can afford to be optimistic.But what would it take,what would it look likeIn practical terms,allow me to share just briefly,a couple of examples.At the level of the enterprise,imagine a capital market,where you earn capital as you work,from one company to another,and the company --indeed, no towering twin peaks.imagine for a momentthe G-20,on behalf of all humanity.And imagine furtherlet's call it "the cosmos,"in units of cosmos --or indeed to a country's trade surplus.This is not a new idea.in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.The problem isNow we do,The world that I am describing to youis simultaneously libertarian,Marxist,the division between capital and labor,and Keynesian,global Keynesian.But above all else,Will such a world dawn?It is our choice,and we'd better make it democratically.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...then Marx is relevant.if we don't do it,such a massive fall in aggregate demand,as it is now,But so is Hayek,that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,and so is Keynes,so that's why I'm totally confused.(Laughter)BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.(Laughter)(Applause)YV: That was Einstein, actually --and last night at the speaker dinner,Would you like to share that?democracy to the political sphere,the economic sphere --a completely democracy-free zone.In a sense,if I am allowed to be provocative,Because remember,that's a mistake, historically.And to be castigating Chinasmacks of hypocrisy.YV: I knew this was coming.BG: Yes.BG: Six months after,and very disappointing,Not just Greece, the Eurozone.To move away from the complacencygoing through the Eurozone,which by the way,to put it right.And, unfortunately,the powers in the Eurozone,in the Eurogroup,chose to maintain denial.But you know what happens.When you try to keep aliveyou may succeed in prolonging it,but when change happensYV: Well, there's no doubtthe Eurozone has no future.YV: Every day.(Applause)No, but seriously.who tells you after six months in a job,especially in such a stressful situation,Of course I made mistakes.for the extension of a loan agreementin the end of February.I was imaginingto find common ground.And there wasn't.just because they did not wantthat were running through the Eurozone.And because they didn't want to admitWe lost one-third of our nominal GDP.This is worse than the Great Depression.And no one has come cleanto say, "This was a colossal mistake."BG: Despite all this,YV: Absolutely.Because if it doesn't,will be demonic,and they will destroy the European Union.but for the whole global economy.And if we allow ourselveswhich seems to me to be what we are doing,then that will be detrimentalYanis, thank you for coming to TED.YV: Thank you.(Applause)

The applications start rolling in,Now the choosing begins.great recommendations.All the right stuff.But remember -- both are qualified.So I ask you:who are you going to pick?We call A "the Silver Spoon,"And we call B "the Scrapper,"to get to the same point.as Silver Spoons and Scrappers --(Laughter)(Laughter)let me explain.A resume tells a story.that makes me stop and fully consider thembefore tossing their resumes away.A series of odd jobs may indicateTo be clear,takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice.how will you handle the tough times?Eventually, he quit.But on the flip side,and you actually succeed?Before I was born,Our lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest,"one part "Awakenings"and one part "A Beautiful Mind."(Laughter)So I was highly motivatedAs I met successful business peopleand read profiles of high-powered leaders,I noticed some commonality.anywhere from poverty, abandonment,death of a parent while young,on children at risk,among a subset of 698 childrenOne-third.Take this resume.He never finishes college.He job-hops quite a bit,goes on a sojourn to India for a year,and to top it off, he has dyslexia.Would you hire this guy?His name is Steve Jobs.In the US,who experience post traumatic growth,they now view their learning disabilityThey embrace their trauma and hardshipsas key elements of who they've become,and know that without those experiences,to become successful.the schools were closedwhen he got a job in a clothing factory.But instead of accepting his fate,of middle and high school.He did it, he succeeded.Today, he holds a master's degree,Scrappers are propelled by the beliefWhen things don't turn out well,Scrappers have a sense of purposeyou figure, "Business challenges? --(Laughter)Really?Piece of cake. I got this."(Laughter)And that reminds me -- humor.And finally, there are relationships.Somewhere along the way,and who are invested in their success.is essential to overcoming adversity.I was lucky.In my first job after college,She watched me workand encouraged me to focus on my futureand not dwell on my past.Along the way I've met many peopleadvice and mentorship.These people don't mind(Laughter)tend to support Scrappersand outperform their peers.According to DiversityInc,outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 25 percent.So back to my original question.Who are you going to bet on:Silver Spoon or Scrapper?I say choose the underestimated contender,Hire the Scrapper.(Applause)

I had a friend tell me,It's all about just building your resume."I don't know if anyone's ever felt that.had already automated my job role.Well, as I'm trying to figure out(Laughter)don't enjoy their work.I'm guessing this room is different,that wake up inspired every day,who lead these lives of quiet desperation.and I read books and did case studies,what that was for me."You're into this career thing.within two months.And so often their answer would be,or no wall at all.and inspire people to change?which I'll explain in a little bit.of really three simple thingsyou're never going to find it.but don't even get me started on that.so we know what our soul is made of,And then the next step is our experiences.about what we love, what we hate,and assimilating that learningwhat can I apply more to my life.but whatever it is, take note on that,and make a better impact.He says, "Oh, it's simple. More."And he just smiles.But once we have this framework together,my values, who I am as a person,Either way, we start to believe it.people thought were crazy at first.until Roger Bannister stood up and did it.And then what happened?if we can push those limits a bit.If you don't think you can run a mile,you realize that confidence compoundsI'm terrified of deep, dark, blue water.when I was a kid.I swear there's something in there.ridiculous, but it's there.right down here in the San Francisco Bay.And he dives in, swims off. OK.(Laughter)And of the 80 people swimming that day,What would you have said yes to?and I'm getting out of the waterAnd he's just flailing like this.This was not fatigue.totally limp.and they plop him down in his wheelchair.when he made this accomplishment.I just had no idea he was going to swim.of what you believe is possible.and it starts with little bitty steps.And the best way to do thisThere's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says.and also individually.and it proves the same thing over again,so we have to manage those surroundings.I found myself in this situation --personal example, a couple years ago.and I was doing all I could,Thank you guys for the support.(Applause)and I was about to shut it down,and right about then,of businesses and websites and blogsand he supports his whole familyAnd after four years of zero growth,for Live Your Legend so many years back.you know, you ask what was going on.that you could have movements like this.to how could I possibly not.it ripples across your whole world.why I go to every TED event I can,They are 100 percent in our control.You can't control a recession.Most things are totally out of our hands.These three things are totally on us,than had been laid off.That's not a cliché anymore.and you can learn from them.

Today I'm going to talk about work."Why do we work?"instead of living our lives(Laughter)"Why do we work?"but that's not why we do what we do.And in general,for doing the work that we do.we are not just being descriptive.(Laughter)Now, I think this is totally obvious,an incredibly profound question.Why, if this is so obvious,Why is it that as capitalism developed,Workers who do this kind of work,or in fulfillment warehouses,do it for pay.So the question is, "Why?"And here's the answer:the answer is technology.Now, I know, I know --that's not what I mean.profound though that is.I'm talking about another technology.I'm talking about the technology of ideas.I call it, "idea technology" --how clever of me.(Laughter)Science creates ways of understanding.And in the social sciences,and how we act.you shrink into despair.then you rise up in revolt.that science gives us.With things, if the technology sucks,it just vanishes, right?Bad technology disappears.With ideas --if people believe that they're true.except for the pay at the end of the day.and the way you made it worth their whileSo the work example is merely an examplethat ends up making them true.It is not trueIt is truethat you "can't get good help anymore"And interestingly enough, Adam Smith --of mass production, and division of labor-- understood this.Now, notice the word here is "become."and deprives people of the opportunityand have complete confidenceIt's going to work the same damn wayto have a human natureWe design human natureAnd so you people --Thank you.(Applause)Thanks.



jamie_bartlett_how_the_mysterious_dark_net_is_going_mainstream
1906776

there really is only one place to go,Now, you can't get to these sitesknown as Tor hidden services,called the Tor browser.It then became open source,and it allows anybody to browse the netwithout giving away their location.that use the same software.You can use it on the normal Internet,but it's also your key to the dark net.are incredibly difficult to shut down.for anybody with something to hide,On the dark net, you will findwhistle-blower sites, The New Yorker.You will find political activism blogs.You will find libraries of pirated books.But you'll also find the drugs markets,and much more besides.anywhere on the net.takes place in big businesses,takes place in world-class universities,it also takes place in the fringes,In this part of the Internet,you will not find a single lolcat,a single pop-up advert anywhere.And that's one of the reasons why I think(Laughter)to go and procure high-quality narcotics.But let's say for a moment that you were.(Laughter)Bear with me.is how familiar it looks.Every single product --thousands of products --has a glossy, high-res image,a detailed product description, a price.There's a "Proceed to checkout" icon.There is even, most beautifully of all,a "Report this item" button.(Laughter)Incredible.you pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin,which it nearly always does.That's important.Something far simpler than that.It's the user reviews.(Laughter)uses a pseudonym, naturally enough,the only way of trusting a vendorfrom other users of the site.and the vendors are attentive,they're polite, they're consumer-centric,buy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery,to keep you happy.I spoke to Drugsheaven.at a reasonable price.He had a very generous refund policy,detailed T's and C's,and good shipping times."Dear Drugsheaven," I wrote,A couple of hours later, I get a reply.They always reply."Hi there, thanks for your email.(Laughter)I do hope we can do business together.Best wishes, Drugsheaven."(Laughter)95 percent of them were five out of five.The customer, you see, is king.But what does that mean?Well, on the one hand,to more people.you have a reasonably good wayNow, as I said,But these markets,the inhospitable conditions,more decentralized, harder to censor,and more customer-friendly.Let's take the payment system.You don't pay with your credit card,So you use the crypto-currency bitcoin,before they'd mailed the drugs out.So on purchasing my item,I would send my bitcointo a neutral, secure third digital wallet.and then when I received it,vendor, buyer, site administrator --would have to sign the transaction offwith a unique digital signature,and then the money would be transferred.Brilliant!Elegant.It works.because every bitcoin transactionSo they came up with a tumbling service.they're tumbled and jumbled up,but they're different bitcoins:micro-laundering systems.(Laughter)It's incredible.Check Grams, the search engine.You can even buy some advertising space.(Laughter)Yeah.(Laughter)but Guatemalan farmers.into local education programs.(Laughter)There's even a mystery shopper.where nobody knows who anybody else is,is a staggering achievement,a phenomenal achievement.And it's that kind of innovationthat's why those on the fringesIt's easy to forgetthat because of its short life,over the last 30 years or so.but I think it's going to change again.creative, secure, difficult to censor --I think that's the future.And the reason it's the futureSince the revelations from Edward Snowden,using various privacy-enhancing tools.of the Tor browser,sometimes even mundane.default encrypted messaging services.And here's the thing --the more of us join,the more interesting those sites become,and then the more of us join, and so on.And I think that's what's going to happen.In fact, it's already happening.and a hideout for whistle-blowers.It's already going mainstream.Facebook has started a dark net site.Yes, the dark net is going mainstream,every major news outlet,will be using the dark net, too.more exciting, more innovative,more terrible,more destructive.It's good news if you care about freedom.It's also good newsand if you want to buy and sell drugswith impunity.Neither entirely dark, nor entirely light.Thank you very much, indeed.(Applause)

named William Muir studied chickens.He was interested in productivity --(Laughter)so he devised a beautiful experiment.and he let it alone for six generations.But then he created a second groupyou could call them superchickens --and he put them together in a superflock,After six generations had passed,what did he find?They were all plump and fully featheredWhat about the second group?Well, all but three were dead.They'd pecked the rest to death.(Laughter)"That superflock, that's my company."(Laughter)Or, "That's my country."Or, "That's my life."is its own reward.or by superstars.But for the past 50 years,along the superchicken model.aggression, dysfunction and waste.and a richer way to live.(Applause)So what is it that makes some groupsThey brought in hundreds of volunteers,with spectacularly high I.Q.aggregate I.Q.and the groups that scored highly on thisdid better.so that no one voice dominated,but neither were there any passengers.And thirdly, the more successful groupshad more women in them.(Applause)the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test,but what's key to thatideas can flow and grow.for the Beijing Olympics.Now, this building had to receivethat were coming off long-haul flights,what quantity of waste to cater for?tweaking the spreadsheet.Instead, he asked for helpThe problem was solved in less than a day.is central to their success.Now, helpfulness sounds really anemic,but it doesn't.I realized that we were getting stuck.didn't know each other.that we achieved real momentum.that have banned coffee cups at desksand talk to each other.It means collective restoration.At Idexx, a company up in Maine,from different parts of the businessHave they all gone mad?and it always will get toughwhat people need is social support,and they need to know who to ask for help.And what motivates peopleWhat matters is the mortar,not just the bricks.Now, when you put all of this together,What does this mean in practical terms?It means that time is everything,And time is what builds value.that they synchronize coffee breaksprofits went up 15 million dollars,Not a bad return on social capital,which compounds even as you spend it.because that's what their contribution is.because no idea is born fully formed.that they achieve their potential.And that's what social capital supports.We're used to talking about stars.does that mean no more stars?So I went and I sat in on the auditionsAnd what I saw there really surprised me,because that's where the drama is.It's just, they don't last very long.in themselves."for their ingenuity and creativity,I couldn't even see any superstars,because everybody there really mattered.And when I reflected on my own career,(Laughter) (Applause)a lot of things have to change.employees against each other.that money erodes social connectedness.Now, we need to redefine leadershipWe know that this works.the risks were immense.CFCs were everywhere,there will be no stars in this team.We need everybody.Everybody has a valid perspective.Second, we work to one standard only:the best imaginable.that he had to butt out,Now, this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing.He gave the team air cover,this group cracked it first.And to date, the Montreal Protocolever implemented.There was a lot at stake then,and there's a lot at stake now,by a few supermen or superwomen.Now we need everybody,to create the best beyond measure.Thank you.(Applause)

I'm really excited to share with yousome findings that really surprise meI believe that the startup organizationand organize them in a startup,why do so many fail?That's what I wanted to find out.for startup success.I wanted to know thisto college, when I made loudspeakers.many successes, and many big failures.We learned a lot from those failures.So I tried to look across what factorsSo I looked at these five.First, the idea.But then over time,that mattered even more than the idea.but he once said,So much about a team's executionThe customer is the true reality.And that's why I came to thinkThen I looked at the funding.Maybe that's the most important thing?Is it just right?across many companies.and 100 non-Idealab companiesSo first, on these Idealab companies,the top five companies --those all became billion-dollar successes.And the five companies on the bottom --And some failures:Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.comFlooz and Friendster.The bottom companies had intense funding,but they didn't succeed.and the results really surprised me.The number one thing was timing.Timing accounted for 42 percentTeam and execution came in second,and the idea,that actually came in third.Now, this isn't absolutely definitive,And funding, I think as well,especially in today's age,because people thought,Of course, people proved that wrong.But one of the reasons it succeeded,is the timing.when people really needed extra money,and that maybe helped people overcomeSame thing with Uber.Uber came out,great execution, too.But the timing was so perfectWe thought the idea was so great,And then some of our failures.We were so excited about it --Just two years later,YouTube was perfectly timed.Great idea, but unbelievable timing.So what I would say, in summary,is execution definitely matters a lot.The idea matters a lot.But timing might matter even more.And the best way to really assess timingfor what you have to offer them.And to be really, really honest about it,As I said earlier,I hope some of these insightsthat wouldn't have happened otherwise.(Applause)

I have a confession to make.I'm a business professorBut recently, I've discoveredI'm an ethnographer.I use the methods of anthropologySo along with three co-conspirators,exceptional leaders of innovation.We studied 16 men and women,working in 12 different industries.on-site, watching these leaders in action.The bottom line?and inspiring others to execute it.But what do we mean by innovation?It can be a product or service.We have a pretty inclusive definition.How many of you recognize this man?Put your hands up.How about these familiar faces?(Laughter)From your show of hands,but very few of you recognized Ed Catmull,the founder and CEO of Pixar --My first visit to Pixar was in 2005,when they were working on "Ratatouille,"that number 15 is sure to be a winner.But we all know that's a myth.Innovation is not about solo genius,it's about collective genius.to make one of those movies.To help us understand the process,He did so reluctantly,done by discrete groups.So think about it.Some shots go through quickly.They don't all go through in order.So if you think about that scene in "Up"The other thing about a Pixar movieuntil the entire movie wraps.It was beautiful, but he said,"Let's put in those few seconds of film."Innovation is a journey.and different points of view.Innovations rarely get created full-blown.As many of you know,Most of those failures are attributedwe found that innovative organizationsthrough debate and discourse.they don't minimize them.where people suspend their judgment.to create a portfolio of alternatives.Individuals in innovative organizationsIt's about discovery-driven learningExperiments are usually about learning.When you get a negative outcome,Pilots are often about being right.This is about doing decision makingto reconfigure them in new combinationsThey don't compromise.Instead, they have developedand not simply either/or solutions.These three capabilities are why we seethat Pixar is able to do what it does.Let me give you another example,was a man named Bill Coughran.They thought about it for a while.around different alternatives.Two groups coalesced.One became known as Big Table,on their particular approach.was the right one for the moment.So they selected that one.of the Build it From Scratch team,to work on the next-generation system.This whole process took nearly two years,of running parallel experiments."Leadership is the secret sauce.But it's a different kind of leadership,"Linda, I don't read books on leadership.is exactly what is needed.of innovative problem solving.and building those three capabilities.How do they define leadership?to which people want to belong.What do they focus their time on?Not on creating a vision.so that people will interact?is allowed to give notes to the directorWhat can we do to make surespeak up and are heard?(Laughter)My job is to nurture the bottom-upand not let it degenerate into chaos."How did he see his role?I'm never a dictator of viewpoints."Advice about how you exercise the role?Hire people who argue with you.And, guess what?what are these people thinking?They're thinking,or you don't work at a Google,I want to tell you there's still hope.We've studied many organizationsas ones where a lot of innovation happens.an Indian outsourcing company.When we met Vineet,we saw at Pixar or Google.So they began to work on that.as the source of innovation.to that level.by loosening the stranglehold of the few,that was happening every day.were in fact visionaries.is to set the stage, not perform on it.If we want to invent a better future,then we need to reimagine our task.Our task is to create the spacewhere everybody's slices of geniuscan be unleashed and harnessed,Thank you.(Applause)

I call them my terminal days.My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term,and my parents and grandparents had it.who looks at my exams and says,"Ricardo, things don't look very good.You have six months or a year to live."I'm going to visit these places,But of course, we all knowIt's very difficult to do.So I said, I'm going to do something else.And I will do, during those days,(Laughter)When you think about --(Applause)when you think about the opposite of work,we, many times, think it's leisure.It's a very crowded thing that we do.The opposite of work is idleness.we have very little time.So this is not a simple business.We looked at it and we said,this is what you don't say,and let's see what's left.So we started this about 30 years ago,And so we said, look, the retirement,why don't you do it next week?And we'll do it like this,you go and do this on Wednesday.And what we found --we thought, these are the older peoplewere 29, of course.And so we started looking,So we started saying things like,what time you left, etc.?Can't we exchange this for a contractWhy are we building these headquarters?and big and important?So we started asking questions one by one.We'd say it like this:One: How do we find people?look, when you come to us,So, come have your interviews.And then, come back.(Laughter)by their future subordinates.We said things like,why can't people set their own salaries?What do they need to know?how much people make inside the company,So we started having, in the cafeteria,what the margins are, and so forth.And this is 25 years ago.we don't want to know where you work.Don't tell us where you are.we had two people in the H.R. department,and thankfully one of them has retired.(Laughter)People are the only thing we have.in the terminal days and in the company,which is, how do you set up for wisdom?So for example, many times,So we'd say things like,(Laughter) (Applause)So the process is looking for wisdom.for the first two people who showed up.(Laughter)And the fact is that they kept us honest.we'd say, now wait a second,Where do we start?how do you redesign school for wisdom?we need the directors to do more.The teacher's role is entirely obsolete.(Applause)what would it look like?and Lumiar says the following:One guy, we'll call a tutor.But please don't teach,Keep that to yourself.(Laughter)And we use the senior citizens,So we bring them to school and we say,So we have violinists teaching math.We have all kinds of things where we say,How do we express ourselves?but also for grammar.We know nothing about love,we know nothing about death,we know nothing about why we're here.So that's a big part of what we do.(Applause)We'd say, why do we have to scold the kidswhich meets once a week.And we'd say, you put the rules togetherSo can you all hit yourself on the head?Sure, for a week, try.except they're theirs.And then, they have the power,And then, in this same vein,we keep a digital mosaic,with 600 tiles of a mosaic,You can't.You don't know anymore.(Laughter) (Applause)I'll give it to Bill Gates. (Laughter)he says, look, you're a silly guyBut I like sharing as you go better.(Applause)I taught MBAs at MIT for a timeIt is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge.And I did another stroll around,which did me better, which was,why do I want to be remembered at all?(Laughter)we had a big pit with fire,This is a book in 38 languages,And that did two things.They don't know what I do.(Laughter)Which is good.And I'm not going to take them somewhere(Laughter)The five kids know nothing, which is good.And the second thing is,in part of those terminal days.And some people would say,and so you go out and do everything.No, we've been to the beaches,so that's done.I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas.So, we've been busy.(Laughter)And so I'm writing a new book.And so I've been trying for 10 yearsmuch as the public schools we have,has 91 out of 100.But for free, nobody wants it.I think is a little bit like this:to email and work from home.But very few of us have learnedyou will come to the question, what for?What am I doing this for?you'll have a much wiser future.Thank you very much.(Applause)(Laughter)To many people, this seems crazy.And yet so deeply wise, also.Your ideas are so radical.is still quite low.but I don't think it's very important.but that's a very personal one.CA: So that's the key thing?in the business point of view this works,RS: They don't even have the incentive.It's a quarterly report.If you're not good in 90 days, you're out.And the guy says, "Get out of here."So this is the problem.(Laughter)We put it out there.Suddenly, you find people --This will find its own place.this is so good you've got to do this.and then people will do it no matter what.that my son asked me when he was three.There is no other question.Nobody has any other question.and you're saying, boy --not in a week, not in two months,to say, no, what am I doing this for?Stop everything. Let me do something else.And it will be okay,if you're stuck in a process.this penultimate day of TED.Ricardo Semler, thank you so much.RS: Thank you so much.(Applause)



tom_wujec_got_a_wicked_problem_first_tell_me_how_you_make_toast
2282776

Some years ago,I stumbled across a simple design exercisebut under deep inspection,The exercise has three partswhich is how to make toast.And most people draw something like this.The toast is then deposited for some time.and some of them are very good,Under close inspection,and all about the transformation of toast.(Laughter)that goes all the way back to the store.So it's crazy stuff.But I think it's obviousDo you see it? What's common about these?Most drawings have nodes and links.that produces a full systems model,about how we think something works.So that's the value of these things.That seems obvious.and many students make toast with a fire.Less than that, the drawing seems trivial,but it's quick to understand,It's too complex.So the sweet spot is between 5 and 13.which is how to make toast,So what happens then?and more logical nodes.rearranging them like Lego blocks.It's the essence of the design process.And systems theorists do tell usThe drawings are much richer.So what happens then?Well, here's what happens.and then it gets messier,but as people refine the models,the best nodes become more prominent,What emerges is a unified systems modelso that's a really different outcomebut participants don't feel map shockTo deal with contradictions, for example,because we iterate much more fluidly.So that's interesting.or long-term sustainability?by collaboratively drawing them out.really have an edge.And the practice is really pretty simple.produces some really remarkable outcomes.What's really important to knownot just the models themselves.And these visual frames of referenceBig publishing company.They lost a bunch of money one year,systems upon systems,I've collected a bunch of best practices.and download examples of various templateshelps us get clear, engaged and aligned.remember what design has to teach us.It's simple, it's fun, it's powerful,Thank you.(Applause)

I didn't follow along with the crowd.I was outspoken and extremely social.(Laughter)and that changed everything.After all, I was a bit unconventional.But I realize nowHiding is a progressive habit,and once you start hiding,In fact, even now,I made up a cover storySo it is fitting and scaryI am a lesbian.(Applause)Thank you.I've struggled to say those words,uniquely Morgana,Just Morgana.this may not seem like a big deal to you.and hidden this for so long.And I'm not alone, of course.hide aspects of their identity.Of all the employees they surveyed,in order to fit in at work.The study found that even in companiesto their long-term career advancement.Twelve years:compared to accepting communities.Twelve years reduced life expectancy.I realized had a ripple effectfor every story just like mine.and atmosphere of discrimination.A former coworker and friend of mineHe voted in favor of the bill,How does my friend feelHow does her father feel?And that shakes me to the core.What if I had told her my story years ago?I will never know,to try to make a difference.a profession that works to welcome,should be reflected in the workplace,When I came to this company one year ago,But I didn't.I did nothing.(Applause)"Remember this."are my own fears and insecurities.I made a choice todayThank you.(Applause)

that consumes no electricity.That's a cool invention, literally.And since we are in South America,let's go to Lima in Peru,a region with high humidityThe Peruvians are amazing.For the past seven years,Many of them did not go to school.They don't invent stuff in big R&amp;D labs.The street is the lab.Why do they do that?like capital and energy,are also scarce in those regions.In India, we call it Jugaad.Jugaad is a Hindi wordbut they create more value at lower cost.are like alchemists.which is the essence of frugal innovation.using fewer resources.Let's first go to China,has developed a telemedicine solutionin Chinese villages.Now let's go to Kenya,a solar radio, and a cell phone charger.using your mobile phone.This is an amazing solution for Kenya,This shows that with frugal innovationI live in Silicon Valley,Think of the iPhone 5, 6, then 7, 8.And third, most importantly,because of the growing income disparityand basic needs of customers.Do you know that today,because existing banking servicesand face deprivation.is if we learn to do more with less.Let me give you two examples.When I first saw this building,and the food multinational Danoneto make high-quality yogurt in Bangladesh.and cost much less to build.I guess you can call it a low-fat factory.Danone was so inspired by this modelNow, when you see this example,Actually, no.Let me give you an example.and yet consumes less energy,and radiation dosage by up to 60 percent.But the frugal innovation revolutionwho are coming up with amazing solutionsthat personally inspire me.It's called gThrive.It pays for itself within one year.How do they do that?all with no additional charge.now being adopted in the North.Ultimately, we would like to seethat benefit the entire humanity.Let's go to Nairobi to find that out.Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams.To ease the situation,Instead they process images, traffic data,at least 20 percent faster.and yet more effective.that I want to share with youto do more with less.The first principle is: Keep it simple.like the C.T. scanner we saw in China.Companies tend to scale up verticallylike Grameen Bank has shown.as it faces resource constraints.of innovators from around the worldto cocreate frugal solutionswhile preserving our precious planet.Thank you very much.(Applause)

The power of yet.I heard about a high school in ChicagoAnd I thought that was fantastic,But if you get the grade "Not Yet"It gives you a path into the future.a real turning point.I wanted to seeso I gave 10-year-oldsThey had what I call a growth mindset.From their more fixed mindset perspective,they were gripped in the tyranny of now.So what do they do next?I'll tell you what they do next.In another study, after a failure,as students confronted an error.There's hardly any activity.They run from the error.They don't engage with it.the idea that abilities can be developed.They engage deeply.Their brain is on fire with yet.They engage deeply.They process the error.They learn from it and they correct it.How are we raising our children?into their future lives?we have already raised a generationwithout an award.So what can we do?How can we build that bridge to yet?Here are some things we can do.That has failed.Don't do that anymore.their improvement.This process praisecreates kids who are hardy and resilient.There are other ways to reward yet.We recently teamed up with game scientistsfrom the University of WashingtonThe usual math gamebut this game rewarded process.And we got more effort,more strategies,give kids greater confidence,In one study, we taught themto learn something new and difficult,and over time they can get smarter.Look what happened: in this study,So let's talk about equality.who chronically underperform,for example, children in inner cities,equality happens.And here are just a few examples.In one year,on the state math test.In a year to a year and a half,This happened because the meaningof effort and difficulty were transformed.Before, effort and difficultybut now, effort and difficulty,stronger connections.That's when they're getting smarter.He said, "Dear Professor Dweck,I put more effort into my schoolwork,into my relationship with my family,Let's not waste any more lives,because once we knowthat abilities are capable of such growth,to live in places that create that growth,to live in places filled with yet.Thank you.(Applause)

2014 is a very special year for me:20 years as a consultant,20 years of marriage,and I'm turning 50 in one month.It was a gray November day,and I was overdue.As a matter of fact,more than 1.3 million.Last year, we just hit over 600,000,so half of my number.(Laughter) (Applause)so people over 15 and under 65,Now, let's do a simple simulationAs you can see,the peak is moving to the right,By the way, I don't need any forecastsThe red area,is already set in stone today,except for much higher migration rates.it is much, much smaller.what does this mean for Germany?so people who provide labor,Now, what about labor demand?That's where it gets tricky."It depends."So I would say it depends.We didn't want to forecast the future.Highly speculative.We did something else.over the last 20 years,and calculated the following scenario:we could directly calculateAnd this is the green line: labor demand.Eight million people are missing,so big numbers, really big numbers.And we calculated several scenarios,and the picture always looked like this.Now, to close the gap,get many more women in the workforce,increase retirement age —and all these measures at once.We won't grow anymore. Why?But where?for the largest 15 economies in the world,Blue indicates a labor surplus,red indicates a labor shortfall,like Italy, France, the U.S.,in most of our largest economies,as well as Brazil and Russia.Now, to tell the truth,What you can see here are average numbers.We de-averaged themand what we foundSo on top of an overall labor shortage,and this means huge challengesin terms of education, qualification,upskilling for governments and companies.Now, the short answer would bedriven by technology.A long answer would go like this.Let's take Germany again.when it comes to productivity.(Laughter)That was 1998.(Laughter) (Applause)Not only in the production industry,but even office workers are in jeopardyand might be replaced by robots,but when, how fast, and to what extent?Or in other words,Yes and no.(Laughter)and automation has already taken place.was caused by electronic parts.Today, this number is more than 30 percentlike the cognitive systems engineerAs a matter of fact,in spite of robots and automation.So what does this mean?And this kind of de-averagingSo people, high-skilled people,Are they actually willing to work abroad?What are their job preferences?at least in the short term,so we asked about mobility.are willing to work abroad.For me, a surprisingly high number.this number is even higher.If you split this number up by country,yes, the world is mobile, but only partly.Now where would these people like to move?So, what are they looking for?Number four,having a great relationship with the boss;three, enjoying a great work-life balance;and the top priority worldwideis being appreciated for your work.So, do I get a thank you?but every day.People are looking for recognition.Now, let me connect the dots.We will face a global workforce crisisplus a huge skill mismatch,plus a big cultural challenge.Every company,but also every country,needs a people strategy,and to act on it immediately,Number one, a plangeneration Y, women, but also retirees.And four,for how to retain the best people,or in other words,Employees are resources, are assets,not costs, not head counts,not machines,not even the Germans.Thank you.(Applause)

Picture this:It's Monday morning,you're at the office,you're settling in for the day at work,walks right into your cubicleand he steals your chair.Doesn't say a word —just rolls away with it.to get some work done today.and you'd say, "Why my chair?"(Laughter)But there's no agenda.you go back to your desk,"Boy, I wish I had those two hours back,like I wish I had my chair back."(Laughter)Every day, we allow our coworkers,to steal from us.I'm talking about time. Your time.In fact, I believe thatMindless Accept Syndrome.(Laughter)(Laughter)Meetings are important, right?But between globalizationand pervasive information technology,the way that we workAnd we're miserable. (Laughter)which is a self-inflicted wound.Let me tell you why.It goes on for about five minutes,And everybody leaves very angry.It's kind of funny.(Laughter)Let's take a quick look.As a group, we need to decide if —bloop bloop —Hi, who just joined?Hi, it's Joe. I'm working from home today.(Laughter)so let's skip the roll calland I'm gonna dive right in.As a group, we need to decide if —bloop bloop —(Laughter)Hi, who just joined?No? I thought I heard a beep. (Laughter)Sound familiar?A couple of weeks after I put that online,500,000 people in dozens of countries,I mean dozens of countries,watched this video.It's close to about a million right now.And if the numbers —there are the many, many thousandsof comments posted onlineafter the video went up.Thousands of people wrote things like,"OMG, that was my day today!""That was my day every day!""This is my life."One guy wrote,"It's funny because it's true.Eerily, sadly, depressingly true.It made me laugh until I cried.And cried. And I cried some more."(Laughter)This poor guy said,These are real quotesand it's real sad.and live to meet another day.It's right at our fingertips, literally.It's something that I call ¡No MAS!(Laughter)click the tentative button!It's right next to the accept button.And if we do this often enough,and we do it respectfully,No MAS!Thank you.(Applause).

that I should be fired,have my medical license taken away,that I should go back to my own country.My email got hacked.In a discussion forum for other doctors,but then came the response:"Too bad it wasn't a real bomb."I never thought that I would do somethingBecoming a doctor was my dream.I grew up in China,She was about the same age as my mother.She had this wild, curly hair,She was one of those doctors who,if you fell and you broke your arm,she would ask you why you weren't laughingbecause it's your humerus. Get it?See, you'd groan,Well, we all have that childhood heroWell, I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam.so that I could pursue my dream.Well, eventually I learned enough English,and my parents were so happyBut then one day, everything changed.I knew something had to be really wrong.And it was:She went through surgery and radiation,and was on her third round of chemotherapywhen she lost her address book.On several websites,and in fact often spoke on behalfShe called me in a panic,and I didn't know what to believe.but maybe it wasn't.It made her scared and it made her doubt.When it comes to medicine,having that trust is a must,There's another side to this fear.who was biking back to his dormwhen he got struck and hit,run over by an SUV.He had seven broken ribs,shattered hip bones,Now, imagine being his parentsto find their son in a coma.They asked to attend our bedside roundswhich I thought was a reasonable request,The head doctor, though, said no.He gave all kinds of reasons.Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way.He even said,"What if they see mistakes and sue us?"we have to put on our white coats,put up a wall, and hide behind it.There's a hidden epidemic in medicine.you go to the hospital,you're wearing this flimsy gown,You don't know what's going to happen.But it's not just patients who are scared;doctors are scared too.and what medicine is all about.And so what do we do?Of course, the more we hide,We don't just have a fear of sickness,we have a sickness of fear.Can we bridge this disconnectCan we overcome the sickness of fear?Let me ask you differently:but everyday people.Chinese restaurants and train stations.What did they find?Well, when we asked people,because people understand health carepeople gave three different answers.and certified to practice medicine.not on who pays them.Surprisingly to us,Jonathan, a 28-year-old law student,and specializes in LGBT health.Serena, a 32-year-old accountant,doesn't even like going to the doctorthat to show their doctors their bodiesand tell them their deepest secrets,so that they can make an informed choice.As a result of this, I formed a campaign,Who's My Doctor?Participating doctors voluntarily discloseon a public websiteand what specialty we're in,but also our conflicts of interest.about drug company affiliations,and we talk about how we're paid.Incentives matter.Then, we go one step further.LGBT health, alternative medicine,so you have a right to know who we are.Medscape's public forumand several online doctors' communitieshad thousands of posts about this topic.Here are a few.From a gastroenterologist in Portland:I have loans and mortgages.Well, times may be hard for everyone,but try telling your patientthat you need the free lunch.From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte:From a psychiatrist in New York City:what model of car we drive,and what toilet paper we use."won't affect your patients' health,"More government-mandated stuff?Well, two pieces of good news.(Laughter) (Applause)asking for me to be fired.After the bomb threat, I was done.But then I heard from patients.Over social media, a TweetChat,which I'd learned what that was by then,generated 4.3 million impressions,They wrote with things like,they shouldn't be doing it."Why shouldn't doctors?"And finally, many people wrote and said,"Let us patients decideIn our initial trial,What a crazy new idea, right?Remember Dr. Sam, my doctor in China,with the goofy jokes and the wild hair?Well, she was my doctor,but she was also our neighborI went to the same school as her daughter.My parents and I trusted herand she had no need to hide from us.that he quit smoking a few years ago,that he says he's a regular churchgoer,You knew what he was about,and he had no need to hide from you.But the sickness of fear has taken over,and patients suffer the consequences.I know this firsthand.She was a planner,and how she wanted to die.Not only did she sign advance directives,how it was time for her to go.One day, when I was a resident physician,and put on a breathing machine.The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye,"Do you remember when you were that age?Her oncologist was there too, and said,"This is your mother.if you don't do everything for her?"I knew my mother so well.but I was a physician.to let her die in peace,every single day.We can bridge the disconnectthat having open medical records,will increase patient trust,improve health outcomes,and reduce malpractice.That openness, that trust,is only going to be more importantto address issues like smoking cessation,well, that requires us to establish trust.Brandon Combs, an internist in Denver:The type of relationship I've developed —that's why I entered medicine."Aaron Stupple, an internist in Denver:I don't hide anything from them.This is me. Now tell me about you.We're in this together."May Nguyen, a family physician in Houston:They ask me how I could be so brave.I said, I'm not being brave,it's my job."I leave you today with a final thought.Being totally transparent is scary.You feel naked, exposed and vulnerable,but that vulnerability, that humility,take off our white coats,That's when we establish trust.from one of secrecy and hidingto one that is fully open and engagedfor our patients.Thank you.(Applause)

I grew updiagnosed as phobically shy,and, like at least 20 other peoplein a room of this size,I was a stutterer.Do you dare raise your hand?And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us,because when we are treated that way,we feel invisible sometimes,or talked around and at.And as I started to look at people,which is mostly all I did,I noticed that some peoplereally wanted attention and recognition.Remember, I was young then.So what did they do?What we still do perhaps too often.We talk about ourselves.And yet there are other people I observedwho had what I called a mutuality mindset.In each situation, they found a way to talk about usand create that "us" idea.So my idea to reimagine the worldis to see it one where we all becomegreater opportunity-makers with and for others.There's no greater opportunityor call for action for us nowthan to become opportunity-makerswho use best talents together more oftenfor the greater goodAnd I want to talk to you about that,because even more than giving,even more than giving,is the capacity for us to do something smartertogether for the greater goodthat lifts us both upand that can scale.That's why I'm sitting here.But I also want to point something else out:Each one of youis better than anybody else at something.That disproves that popular notionthat if you're the smartest person in the room,you're in the wrong room.(Laughter)So let me tell you abouta Hollywood party I went to a couple years back,and I met this up-and-coming actress,and we were soon talking about somethingthat we both felt passionately about: public art.And she had the fervent beliefthat every new building in Los Angelesshould have public art in it.She wanted a regulation for it,and she fervently started —who is here from Chicago? —she fervently started talking aboutthese bean-shaped reflective sculpturesin Millennium Park,and people would walk up to itand they'd smile in the reflection of it,and they'd pose and they'd vampand they'd take selfies together,and they'd laugh.I said, "I know someone you ought to meet.(Laughter) —"and he shares your fervent desireHe spent five years in solitary,and he's articulateHe had workout regime he did every day.(Laughter)I think she was following me at that point.I said, "He'd be an unexpected ally."And not just that. There's James. He's an architectand he's a professor, and he loves place-making,and place-making is when you havethose mini-plazas and those urban walkwaysand where they're dotted with art,I think they'd make good allies.And indeed they were.They met together. They prepared.You can't buy that.What I'm asking you to considerbecause more than wealthor fancy titlesor a lot of contacts, it's our capacity to connectAnd I'm not saying this is easy,about who you wanted to connect with,but what I want to suggest is,this is an opportunity.I started thinking about itand trends that transcended businessor politics or lifestyle.So I had to have contactsin different worlds very different than mine,because otherwise you couldn't spot the trends.And third, I had to write the storyin a way stepping into the reader's shoes,That's what opportunity-makers do.And here's a strange thing:Unlike an increasing number of Americanswho think exactly like thembecause we then become more rigid and extreme,opportunity-makers are actively seeking situationswith people unlike them,and they're building relationships,and because they do that,they have trusted relationshipswhere they can bring the right team inand seize more opportunities.They're not affronted by differences,they're fascinated by them,and that is a huge shift in mindset,and I believe in doing that.It's especially important now.Why is it important now?Because things can be devised like dronesand drugs and data collection,and they can be devised by more peopleand cheaper ways for beneficial purposesand then, as we know from the news every day,they can be used for dangerous ones.It calls on us, each of us,to a higher calling.But here's the icing on the cake:It's not just the first opportunitythat you do with somebody elsethat's probably your greatest,as an institution or an individual.It's after you've had that experienceand you trust each other.It's the unexpected thingsthat you devise later onyou never could have predicted.and he was soon talking to Wally,my friend the ex-con,about that exercise regime.And he thought,I have a set of racquetball courts.That guy could teach it.They're frequent travelers.They could practice in their hotel room,no equipment provided.That's how Wally got hired.Not only that, years laterhe was also teaching racquetball.Years after that,he was teaching the racquetball teachers.around a shared interest and action,you're accustomed to serendipitousthings happening into the future,and I think that's what we're looking at.We open ourselves up to those opportunities,key players who are uniquely positioned to do this,to scale systems and projects together.So here's what I'm calling for you to do.Remember the three traits of opportunity-makers.Opportunity-makers keep honing their top strengthand they become pattern seekers.and they communicate to connectaround sweet spots of shared interest.So what I'm asking you is,the world is hungry.I truly believe, in my firsthand experience,the world is hungry for usto unite together as opportunity-makersand to emulate those behaviorsas so many of you already do —I know that firsthand —and to reimagine a worldwhere we use our best talents togethermore often to accomplish greater things togetherthan we could on our own.Just remember,as Dave Liniger once said,"You can't succeedcoming to the potluck with only a fork."(Laughter)Thank you very much.Thank you.

I live in Washington, D.C.,My father was a government worker.My mother could not read or write, but sheown kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere."So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up.But I almost didn't go to collegeuntil an aunt offered financial help.I went to study in Sambalpur,the largest town in the region,I had dreams of going to the United Statesfor higher studies.When the opportunity came,I crossed two oceans, with borrowed moneyfor airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket.In the U.S., I worked in a research center,part-time, while taking graduate classes in economics.And with the little I earned, I wouldfinance myself and then I would sendmoney home to my brother and my father.My story is not unique.There are millions of people who migrate each year.With the help of the family, they cross oceans,They risk their lives to realize a dream,and that dream is as simple as having adecent job somewhere so they can send money homeand help the family,which has helped them before.These are people who live in a countryother than their country of birth.If there was a country made up ofonly international migrants,that would be larger, in population,than Brazil.That would be larger, in its sizeof the economy, than France.Some 180 million of them, from poor countries,send money home regularly.Those sums of money are called remittances.Here is a fact that might surprise you:413 billion dollars, 413 billion dollarswas the amount of remittances sent last yearby migrants to developing countries.Migrants from developing countries,money sent to developing countries —413 billion dollars.That's a remarkable number becausethat is three times the size ofthe total of development aid money.And yet, you and I,my colleagues in Washington,we endlessly debate anddiscuss about development aid,while we ignore remittances as small change.True, people send 200 dollars per month,on average. But, repeated month after month,by millions of people,its IT exports.In Egypt remittances are three timesthe size of revenues from the Suez Canal.In Tajikistan, remittances are 42 percent of GDP.conflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline,as in Somalia or in Haiti.No wonder these flows have hugeimpacts on economies and on poor people.Remittances, unlike private investment money,they don't flow back at the firstsign of trouble in the country.They actually act like an insurance.When the family is in trouble,facing hardship, facing hard times,remittances increase, they act like an insurance.Migrants send more money then.Unlike development aid money,that must go through official agencies,through governments, remittancesdirectly reach the poor,reach the family,and often with business advice.So in Nepal, the share of poorpeople was 42 percent in 1995,the share of poor people in the population.By 2005, a decade later, at atime of political crisis, economic crisis,the share of poor people went down to 31 percent.That decline in poverty, most of it,about half of it, is believed to bebecause of remittances from India,another poor country.In El Salvador, the school dropoutrate among children is lowerin families that receive remittances.In Mexico and Sri Lanka,the birth weight of children is higheramong families that receive remittances.Remittances are dollars wrapped with care.Migrants send money home for food,for buying necessities, for building houses,for funding education, for fundinghealthcare for the elderly, for businessinvestments for friends and family.Migrants send even more money homefor special occasions like a surgeryor a wedding. And migrants also sendmoney, perhaps far too many times,for unexpected funerals thatthey cannot attend.Much as these flows do all that good,there are barriers to theseflows of remittances, these400 billion dollars of remittances.Foremost among them isthe exorbitant cost of sending money home.Money transfer companies structuretheir fees to milk the poor.They will say, "Up to 500 dollarsif you want to send, we will charge you30 dollars fixed."you have to pay that $30 fee.The global average cost of sendingmoney is eight percent.That means you send 100 dollars,the family on the other side receives only92 dollars.To send money to Africa,the cost is even higher:12 percent.To send money within Africa,the cost is even higher:over 20 percent.And then there is the case of Venezuela, where,because of exchange controls,you send 100 dollars and youare lucky if the family on the other sidereceives even 10 dollars.Of course, nobody sends money to Venezuelathrough the official channel.It all goes in suitcases.Whereever costs are high,money goes underground.And what is worse,many developing countries actuallyhave a blanket ban on sending moneyout of the country.Many rich nations also have aSo, is it that there are no options,no better options, cheaper options, to send money?There are.M-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send moneyand receive money at a fixed cost of only60 cents per transaction.U.S. Fed started a program with Mexicoto enable money service businessesto send money to Mexicofor a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction.And yet, these faster, cheaper, better optionscan't be applied internationallybecause of the fear of money laundering,even though there is little datato support any connection, any significantconnection between money launderingand these small remittance transactions.Many international banks noware wary of hosting bank accountsof money service businesses, especiallythose serving Somalia.Somalia, a country where theper capita income is only 250 dollars per year.Monthly remittances, on average, to Somaliais larger than that amount.Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia.And yet, this is an example ofthe right hand giving a lot of aid,while the left hand is cutting the lifebloodto that economy, through regulations.In the villages, the only place where you canget money is through the post office.Most of the governments in the worldhave allowed their post offices to haveexclusive partnerships with money transfer companies.So, if I have to send money to myfather in the village, I must send moneythrough that particular money transfer company,even if the cost is high.I cannot go to a cheaper option.This has to go.So, what can international organizations andsocial entrepreneurs do to reduce the costof sending money home?Governments should recognize thatsmall remittances are not money laundering.Second, governments should abolish exclusive partnershipsFor that matter, between the post officeand any national banking system thathas a large network that serves the poor.In fact, they should promote competition,open up the partnership so thatwe will bring down costs like we did,like they did, in the telecommunications industry.You have seen what has happened there.Third, large nonprofit philanthropic organizationsshould create a remittance platformon a nonprofit basis.They should create a nonprofitremittance platform to serve the money transfercompanies so that they can send money at a low cost,while complying with all the complexregulations all over the world.The development community shouldset a goal of reducing remittance coststo one percent from the current eight percent.If we reduce costs to one percent,bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year.That is larger than, or almost similar to,the total aid budget of the United States government,the largest donor on the planet.Actually, the savings would be largerthan that 30 billion because remittance channelsare also used for aid, trade and investment purposes.Another major impediment to theflow of remittances reaching the familyis the large and exorbitantand illegal cost of recruitment,fees that migrants pay, migrant workerspay to laborers who found them the job.I was in Dubai a few years ago.I visited a camp for workers.It was 8 in the evening, dark, hot, humid.Workers were coming back fromtheir grueling day of work,and I struck a conversationwith a Bangladeshi construction worker.He was preoccupied that he is sendingmoney home, he has beensending money home for a few months now,and the money is mostly goingto the recruitment agent, to the labor agentwho found him that job.And in my mind, I could picturethe wife waiting forthe monthly remittance.The remittance arrives.She takes the money and handsit over to the recruitment agent,while the children are looking on.This has to stop.it is all the workers. There are millions of migrantworkers who suffer from this problem.A construction worker from Bangladesh,That means that for the two years or three yearsof his life, he is basically sending moneyto pay for the recruitment fees.The family doesn't get to see any of it.It is not only Dubai, it is the darkunderbelly of every major city in the world.It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers,it is workers from all over the world.It is not only men.Women are especially vulnerable torecruitment malpractices.One of the most exciting and newestthing happening in the area of remittancesis how to mobilize, through innovation,diaspora saving and diaspora giving.Migrants send money home,but they also save a large amount ofmoney where they live.Annually, migrant savings are estimatedto be 500 billion dollars.Most of that money is parked inbank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate.or four percent interest rate, and then saythat the money would be used for building schools,roads, airports, train systemsin the country of origin, a lotof migrants would be interested inparting with their money becauseit's not only financial gains thatgive them an opportunityto stay engaged with their country's development.Remittance channels can be usedto sell these bonds to migrantsbecause when they comeon a monthly basis to send remittances,You can also do the samefor mobilizing diaspora giving.I would love to invest in abullet train system in Indiaand I would love to contribute to effortsto fight malaria in my village.Remittances are a great way ofsharing prosperity between placesin a targeted way that benefitsthose who need them most.Remittances empower people.We must do all we can to make remittancesand recruitmentsafer and cheaper.And it can be done.As for myself, I have beenaway from India for two decades now.My wife is a Venezuelan.My children are Americans.Increasingly, I feel like a global citizen.And yet, I am growing nostalgicabout my country of birth.I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time.My parents are not there anymore.My brothers and sisters have moved on.There is no real urgency for me to send money home.And yet, from time to time,I send money home to friends,to relatives, to the village,to be there, to stay engaged —that's part of my identity.And, I'm still striving to be a poetfor the hardworking migrantsand their struggle to break freeof the cycle of poverty.Thank you.(Applause)

Women represent50 percent of middle managementand professional positions,represent not even a third of that number.So some people hear that statistic and they ask,why do we have so few women leaders?But I look at that statisticand, if you, like me, believethat leadership manifests at every level,you would see that there's a tremendous,awesome resource of leaderswho are leading in middle management,which raises a different question:Why are there so many womenmired in the middleand what has to happento take them to the top?So some of you might be some of those womenwho are in middle managementand seeking to move up in your organization.I met her two years ago.She was a vice president in a Fortune 50 company,and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration,"I've worked really hard to improve my confidenceand my assertiveness and develop a great brand,I get terrific performance evals from my boss,my 360s in the organization let me knowthat my teams love working for me,I've taken every management course that I can here,I am working with a terrific mentor,and yet I've been passed overtwice for advancement opportunities,even when my manager knowsthat I'm committed to moving upand even interested in an international assignment.I don't understand whyI'm being passed over."So what Tonya doesn't realizeis that there's a missing 33 percentof the career success equation for women,and it's understanding what this missing 33 percent isthat's required to close the gender gap at the top.In order to move up in organizations,you have to be known for your leadership skills,and this would apply to any of you,women or men.It means that you have to be recognizedfor using the greatness in youto achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomesby engaging the greatness in others.Put in other language,it means you have to use your skillsand talents and abilitiesto help the organization achieveits strategic financial goalsand do that by working effectively with othersinside of the organization and outside.And although all three of these elementsof leadership are important,when it comes to moving up in organizations,they aren't equally important.So pay attention to the green boxas I move forward.In seeking and identifyingemployees with high potential,the potential to go to the top of organizations,the skills and competenciesthat relate to that green boxare rated twice as heavilyas those in the other two elements of leadership.These skills and competenciescan be summarized as business,strategic, and financial acumen.In other words, this skill set has to dowith understanding where the organization is going,what its strategy is,what financial targets it has in place,and understanding your rolein moving the organization forward.This is that missing 33 percentof the career success equation for women,not because it's missing in our capabilitiesor abilities,but because it's missing in the advicethat we're given.Here's what I mean by that.Five years ago, I was asked to moderatea panel of executives,and the topic for the evening wasSo think about the three elements of leadershipas I summarize for you what they told me.They said, "We look for peoplewho are smart and hard working and committedand trustworthy and resilient."So which element of leadership does that relate to?Personal greatness.They said, "We look for employeeswho are great with our customers,who empower their teams,who negotiate effectively,who are able to manage conflict well,and are overall great communicators."Which element of leadership does that equate to?Engaging the greatness in others.And then they pretty much stopped.So I asked,"Well, what about peoplewho understand your business,where it's going,and their role in taking it there?And what about people who are ableto scan the external environment,identify risks and opportunities,make strategy or make strategic recommendations?And what about people who are ableto look at the financials of your business,understand the story that the financials tell,and either take appropriate actionor make appropriate recommendations?"And to a man, they said,"That's a given."So I turned to the audienceof 150 women and I asked,"How many of you have ever been toldthat the door-opener for career advancementis your business, strategic and financial acumen,and that all the other important stuffis what differentiates you in the talent pool?"Three women raised their hand,and I've asked this question of womenall around the globe in the five years since,and the percentage is never much different.So this is obvious, right?But how can it be?Well, there are primarily three reasonsthat there's this missing 33 percentin the career success advice given to women?When organizations direct womentoward resourcesthat focus on the conventional advicethat we've been hearing for over 40 years,there's a notable absence of advice that relatesto business, strategic and financial acumen.Much of the advice is emphasizingpersonal actions that we need to take,like become more assertive, become more confident,develop your personal brand,things that Tonya's been working on,and advice about working with other people,things like learn to self-promote,get a mentor, enhance your network,and virtually nothing saidabout the importance of business, strategicand financial acumen.This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant.What it means is that this is advicethat's absolutely essential for breaking throughfrom career start to middle management,but it's not the advicethat gets women to break throughfrom the middle, where we're 50 percent,to senior and executive positions.And this is why conventional advice to womenin 40 years hasn't closed the gender gap at the topand won't close it.Now, the second reasonrelates to Tonya's commentsabout having had excellent performance evals,great feedback from her teams,and having taken every management training programshe can lay her hands on.So you would think that she's gettingmessages from her organizationthrough the talent development systemsand performance management systemsthat let her know how important it isto develop business, strategic and financial acumen,but here again, that green square is quite small.On average,talent and performance management systemsin the organizations that I've worked withfocus three to oneon the other two elements of leadershipcompared to the importance of business,strategic and financial acumen,which is why typical talent and performance systemshaven't closed and won't closethe gender gap at the top.Now, Tonya also talked about working with a mentor,and this is really important to talk about,because if organizations,talent and performance systemsaren't giving people in generalinformation about the importance ofbusiness, strategic and financial acumen,how are men getting to the top?Well, there are primarily two ways.One is because of the positionsthey're guided into,and the other is because of informal mentoringand sponsorship.So what's women's experienceas it relates to mentoring?Well, this comment from an executivethat I worked with recentlyillustrates that experience.He was very proud of the fact that last year,he had two protégés: a man and a woman.And he said, "I helped the woman build confidence,I helped the man learn the business,and I didn't realize that I was treating themany differently."And he was sincere about that.So what this illustrates is thatas managers, whether we're women or men,we have mindsets about women and men,about careers in leadership,and these unexamined mindsetswon't close the gender gap at the top.So how do we take this ideaof the missing 33 percentand turn it into action?Well, for women, the answer is obvious:we have to begin to focus moreon developing and demonstratingthe skills we havethat show that we're people who understandour businesses, where they're headed,and our role in taking it there.That's what enables that breakthroughfrom middle managementto leadership at the top.But you don't have to be a middle manager to do this.One young scientist that works in a biotech firmused her insight about the missing 33 percentto weave financial impact datainto a project update she didand got tremendous positive feedbackfrom the managers in the room.So we don't want to put 100 percentof the responsibility on women's shoulders,nor would it be wise to do so, and here's why:In order for companies to achievetheir strategic financial goals,executives understand that they have to haveeveryone pulling in the same direction.In other words, the term we use in business is,we have to have strategic alignment.And executives know this very well,and yet only 37 percent,according to a recent Conference Board report,believe that they have thatstrategic alignment in place.So for 63 percent of organizations,achieving their strategic financial goalsis questionable.And if you think about what I've just shared,that you have situations where at least 50 percentof your middle managershaven't received clear messagingthat they have to become focused on the business,where it's headed, and their role in taking it there,it's not surprising that that percentageof executives who are confident about alignmentis so low,which is why there are other peoplewho have a role to play in this.It's important for directors on boardsto expect from their executivesproportional pools of women when they sit downonce a year for their succession discussions.Why? Because if they aren't seeing that,it could be a red flagthat their organization isn't as alignedas it could potentially be.It's important for CEOsto also expect these proportional pools,and if they hear comments like,ask the question,"What are we going to do about that?"It's important for H.R. executivesto make sure that the missing 33 percentis appropriately emphasized,and it's important for women and menwho are in management positionsto examine the mindsets we holdabout women and men, about careers and success,to make sure we are creating a level playing fieldfor everybody.So let me close with the latest chapterin Tonya's story.Tonya emailed me two months ago,and during the interview, they probedabout her business acumenand her strategic insights into the industry,and she said that she was so happy to reportthat now she has a new positionat her company.So for some of you, the missing 33 percentis an idea for you to put into action,and I hope that for all of you,you will see it as an idea worth spreadingin order to help organizations be more effective,to help women create careers that soar,and to help close the gender gap at the top.Thank you.(Applause)

We are at a remarkable moment in time.We face over the next two decadestwo fundamental transformationsthat will determine whether the next 100 yearsis the best of centuries or the worst of centuries.Let me illustrate with an example.I first visited Beijing 25 years agoto teach at the People's University of China.China was getting serious about market economicsand about university education,so they decided to call in the foreign experts.Like most other people,I moved around Beijing by bicycle.Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle,it was a safe and easy way to get around.Cycling in Beijing nowis a completely different prospect.The roads are jammed by cars and trucks.The air is dangerously pollutedfrom the burning of coal and diesel.When I was there last in the spring,there was an advisory for people of my age —over 65 —to stay indoors and not move much.How did this come about?It came from the way in whichBeijing has grown as a city.It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled,from 10 million to 20 million.It's become a sprawling urban areadependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy,particularly coal.China burns half the world's coal each year,and that's why, it is a key reason why,it is the world's largest emitterof greenhouse gases.At the same time, we have to recognizethat in that period China has grown remarkably.It has become the world's second largest economy.Hundreds of millions of peoplehave been lifted out of poverty.That's really important.But at the same time, the people of Chinaare asking the question:What's the value of this growthif our cities are unlivable?They've analyzed, diagnosedthat this is an unsustainable path of growthand development.China's planning to scale back coal.It's looking to build its cities in different ways.Now, the growth of Chinais part of a dramatic change, fundamental change,in the structure of the world economy.Just 25 years ago, the developing countries,the poorer countries of the world,they accounted for only about a thirdof the world's output.Now it's more than half;25 years from now, it will probably be two thirdsfrom the countries that we saw 25 years agoas developing.That's a remarkable change.It means that most countries around the world,rich or poor, are going to be facingthe two fundamental transformationsthat I want to talk about and highlight.Now, the first of these transformationsis the basic structural changeof the economies and societiesthat I've already begun to illustratethrough the description of Beijing.Fifty percent now in urban areas.That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050.Over the next two decades, we'll seethe demand for energy rise by 40 percent,and the growth in the economy and in the populationis putting increasing pressure on our land,on our water and on our forests.This is profound structural change.If we manage it in a negligentor a shortsighted way,we will create waste, pollution, congestion,destruction of land and forests.If we think of those three areas that I have illustratedwith my numbers — cities, energy, land —if we manage all that badly,then the outlook for the lives and livelihoodsof the people around the worldwould be poor and damaged.And more than that,the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise,with immense risks to our climate.Concentrations of greenhouse gasesin the atmosphere are alreadyhigher than they've been for millions of years.If we go on increasing those concentrations,we risk temperatures over the next century or sothat we have not seen on this planetfor tens of millions of years.We've been around as Homo sapiens —that's a rather generous definition, sapiens —We risk temperatures we haven't seenfor tens of millions of years over a century.That would transform the relationshipbetween human beings and the planet.It would lead to changing deserts,changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes,changing sea levels,hundreds of millions of people,perhaps billions of people who would have to move,and if we've learned anything from history,that means severe and extended conflict.And we couldn't just turn it off.You can't make a peace treaty with the planet.You can't negotiate with the laws of physics.You're in there. You're stuck.Those are the stakes we're playing for,the climate transformation,and move to a low-carbon economy.Now, the first of these transformationsis going to happen anyway.We have to decide whether to do it well or badly,the economic, or structural, transformation.But the second of the transformations,the climate transformations, we have to decide to do.Those two transformations face usin the next two decades.The next two decades are decisivefor what we have to do.Now, the more I've thought about this,the two transformations coming together,the more I've come to realizethat this is an enormous opportunity.It's an opportunity which we can useor it's an opportunity which we can lose.And let me explain through those three key areasthat I've identified: cities, energy and land.And let me start with cities.I've already described the problems of Beijing:pollution, congestion, waste and so on.Surely we recognize that in many of our citiesaround the world.Now, with cities, like life but particularly cities,you have to think ahead.The cities that are going to be built —and there are many, and many big ones —we have to think of how to design themin a compact wayso that we can connect ourselves much betterwithin those cities, and make it easier,encourage more people, to live closer to the center.We've got examples building around the worldof the kinds of ways in which we can do that.The bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombiais a very important case of how to move aroundsafely and quickly in a non-polluting wayin a city: very frequent buses,strongly protected routes, the same service, really,as an underground railway system,but much, much cheaperand can be done much more quickly,a brilliant idea in many more citiesaround the world that's developing.Now, some things in cities do take time.Some things in cities can happen much more quickly.Take my hometown, London.In 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 peopleand badly damaged the lives of many, many more.And it happened all the time.For those of you live outside London in the U.K.will remember it used to be called The Smoke.That's the way London was.By regulating coal, within a few yearsthe problems of smog were rapidly reduced.I remember the smogs well.When the visibility dropped to [less] thana few meters,they stopped the buses and I had to walk.This was the 1950s.I had to walk home three miles from school.Again, breathing was a hazardous activity.But it was changed. It was changed by a decision.Good decisions can bring good results,striking results, quickly.actually quite quickly and effectively,and we've seen great improvementsin the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system.the structural and the climate,come very much together.But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities,and we have to invest wisely, and if we do,we'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities,more attractive cities, more productive cities,and stronger community in those cities —public transport, recycling, reusing,all sorts of things that bring communities together.We can do that, but we have to think,we have to invest, we have to plan.Let me turn to energy.Now, energy over the last 25 yearshas increased by about 50 percent.Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels.Over the next 20 years,perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so.We have to invest strongly in energy,we have to use it much more efficiently,and we have to make it clean.We can see how to do that.Take the example of California.It would be in the top 10 countries in the worldif it was independent.I don't want to start any —(Laughter)California's a big place.(Laughter)In the next five or six years,they will likely move fromaround 20 percent in renewables —wind, solar and so on —to over 33 percent,and that would bring California backto greenhouse gas emissions in 2020to where they were in 1990,a period when the economy in Californiawould more or less have doubled.That's a striking achievement.It shows what can be done.is planning to get solar technologyto light up the homesof 400 million peoplewho don't have electricity in India.They've set themselves a target of five years.I think they've got a good chance of doing that.We'll see, but what you're seeing nowis people moving much more quickly.Four hundred million, more than the populationof the United States.Those are the kinds of ambitions nowpeople are setting themselvesin terms of rapidity of change.Again, you can seegood decisions can bring quick results,and the climate and the low carbon,are intimately intertwined.Do the first one well, the structural,the second one on the climatebecomes much easier.Look at land,land and particularly forests.Forests are the hosts to valuableplant and animal species.They hold water in the soiland they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,fundamental to the tackling of climate change.But we're losing our forests.In the last decade, we've lost a forest areathe size of Portugal,and much more has been degraded.But we're already seeingthat we can do so much about that.We can recognize the problem, but we can alsounderstand how to tackle it.In Brazil, the rate of deforestationhas been reduced by 70 percentover the last 10 years.How? By involving local communities,investing in their agriculture and their economies,by monitoring more carefully,by enforcing the law more strictly.And it's not just stopping deforestation.That's of course of first and fundamental importance,but it's also regrading degraded land,regenerating, rehabilitating degraded land.I first went to Ethiopia in 1967.It was desperately poor. In the following years,it suffered devastating faminesand profoundly destructive social conflict.Over the last few years, actually more than a few,Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly.It has ambitions to be a middle-income country15 years from nowand to be carbon neutral.Again, I think it's a strong ambitionbut it is a plausible one.You're seeing that commitment there.You're seeing what can be done.Ethiopia is investing in clean energy.It's working in the rehabilitation of land.In Humbo, in southwest Ethiopia,a wonderful projectto plant trees on degraded landand work with local communitieson sustainable forest managementhas led to big increases in living standards.So we can see, from Beijing to London,from California to India,from Brazil to Ethiopia,we do understandhow to manage those two transformations,the structural and the climate.We do understand how to manage those well.And technology is changing very rapidly.I don't have to list all those thingsto an audience like this,but you can see the electric cars,you can see the batteries using new materials.You can see that we can manage remotely nowYou can see better insulation.And there's much more coming.But, and it's a big but,the world as a wholeis moving far too slowly.We're not cutting emissions in the way we should.We're not managing those structural transformationsas we can.are not there yet.The depth of understandingof the attractiveness of what we can dois not there yet.We need political pressure to build.We need leaders to step up.We can have better growth,better climate, a better world.We can make,by managing those two transformations well,the next 100 years the best of centuries.If we make a mess of it,we, you and me, if we make a mess of it,if we don't manage those transformations properly,it will be, the next 100 yearswill be the worst of centuries.That's the major conclusionof the report on the economy and climatechaired by ex-President Felipe Calderón of Mexico,and I co-chaired that with him,and we handed that report yesterdayhere in New York, in the United Nations Buildingto the Secretary-General of the U.N.,Ban Ki-moon.We know that we can do this.Now, two weeks ago,I became a grandfather for the fourth time.Our daughter —(Baby cries) (Laughter) (Applause) —Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New Yorktwo weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa.(Applause)Two weeks old.Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eyeand tell them that we understood the issues,that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities,and still we failed to act?Surely not. Let's make the next 100 yearsthe best of centuries.(Applause)

You probably don't know me,but I am one of those .01 percentersthat you hear about and read about,and I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat.And tonight, what I would like to do is speak directlyto other plutocrats, to my people,because it feels like it's time for us allto have a chat.Like most plutocrats, I too am a proudand unapologetic capitalist.I have founded, cofounded or fundedover 30 companies across a range of industries.I was the first non-family investor in Amazon.com.I cofounded a company called aQuantivethat we sold to Microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars.My friends and I, we own a bank.I tell you this — (Laughter) —unbelievable, right?I tell you this to showthat my life is like most plutocrats.I have a broad perspective on capitalismand business,and I have been rewarded obscenely for thatwith a life that most of you allcan't even imagine:multiple homes, a yacht, my own plane,etc., etc., etc.I am certainly not the hardest working.I was a mediocre student.I'm not technical at all.I can't write a word of code.Truly, my success is the consequenceof spectacular luck,of birth, of circumstance and of timing.But I am actually pretty good at a couple of things.One, I have an unusually high tolerance for risk,and the other is I have a good sense,a good intuition about what will happen in the future,and I think that that intuition about the futureis the essence of good entrepreneurship.So what do I see in our future today,you ask?I see pitchforks,as in angry mobs with pitchforks,because while people like us plutocratsare living beyond the dreams of avarice,the other 99 percent of our fellow citizensare falling farther and farther behind.In 1980, the top one percent of Americansshared about eight percent of national [income],while the bottom 50 percent of Americansshared 18 percent.Thirty years later, today, the top one percentshares over 20 percent of national [income],while the bottom 50 percent of Americansshare 12 or 13.If the trend continues,the top one percent will shareover 30 percent of national [income]in another 30 years,while the bottom 50 percent of Americanswill share just six.You see, the problem isn't that we havesome inequality.Some inequality is necessaryfor a high-functioning capitalist democracy.The problem is that inequalityis at historic highs todayand it's getting worse every day.And if wealth, power, and incomecontinue to concentrateat the very tippy top,our society will changefrom a capitalist democracyto a neo-feudalist rentier societylike 18th-century France.That was Francebefore the revolutionand the mobs with the pitchforks.So I have a message for my fellow plutocratsand zillionairesand for anyone who livesin a gated bubble world:Wake up.Wake up. It cannot last.Because if we do not do somethingto fix the glaring economic inequities in our society,the pitchforks will come for us,for no free and open society can long sustainthis kind of rising economic inequality.It has never happened. There are no examples.You show me a highly unequal society,and I will show you a police stateor an uprising.The pitchforks will come for usif we do not address this.It's not a matter of if, it's when.And it will be terrible when they comefor everyone,but particularly for people like us plutocrats.I know I must sound like some liberal do-gooder.I'm not. I'm not making a moral argumentthat economic inequality is wrong.What I am arguing is that rising economic inequalityis stupid and ultimately self-defeating.Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risksfrom pitchforks,but it's also terrible for business too.So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford.When Ford famously introduced the $5 day,which was twice the prevailing wage at the time,he didn't just increase the productivityof his factories,he converted exploited autoworkers who were poorinto a thriving middle class who could now affordto buy the products that they made.Ford intuited what we now know is true,that an economy is best understood as an ecosystemand characterized by the same kindsof feedback loops you findin a natural ecosystem,a feedback loop between customers and businesses.Raising wages increases demand,which increases hiring,which in turn increases wagesand demand and profits,and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperityis precisely what is missingfrom today's economic recovery.And this is why we need to put behind usthe trickle-down policies that so dominateboth political partiesand embrace something I call middle-out economics.Middle-out economics rejectsthe neoclassical economic ideathat economies are efficient, linear, mechanistic,that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness,and instead embraces the 21st-century ideathat economies are complex, adaptive,ecosystemic,that they're not efficient at allbut are effective if well managed.This 21st-century perspectiveallows you to clearly see that capitalismdoes not work by [efficiently] allocatingexisting resources.It works by [efficiently] creating new solutionsto human problems.The genius of capitalismis that it is an evolutionary solution-finding system.The difference between a poor societyand a rich society, obviously,is the degree to which that societyhas generated solutions in the formof products for its citizens.The sum of the solutionsthat we have in our societyreally is our prosperity, and this explainswhy companies like Google and Amazonand Microsoft and Appleand the entrepreneurs who created those companieshave contributed so muchto our nation's prosperity.This 21st-century perspectivealso makes clearthat what we think of as economic growthis best understood asthe rate at which we solve problems.But that rate is totally dependent uponhow many problem solvers —diverse, able problem solvers — we have,and thus how many of our fellow citizensactively participate,both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions,and as customers who consume them.But this maximizing participation thingdoesn't happen by accident.It doesn't happen by itself.It requires effort and investment,which is why allhighly prosperous capitalist democraciesare characterized by massive investmentsin the middle class and the infrastructurethat they depend on.We plutocrats need to get thistrickle-down economics thing behind us,this idea that the better we do,the better everyone else will do.It's not true. How could it be?I earn 1,000 times the median wage,but I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff,do I?I actually bought two pairs of these pants,what my partner Mike callsmy manager pants.I could have bought 2,000 pairs,but what would I do with them? (Laughter)How many haircuts can I get?How often can I go out to dinner?No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get,we can never drive a great national economy.Only a thriving middle class can do that.There's nothing to be done,my plutocrat friends might say.Henry Ford was in a different time.Maybe we can't do some things.Maybe we can do some things.June 19, 2013,Bloomberg published an article I wrote called"The Capitalist’s Case for a $15 Minimum Wage."The good people at Forbes magazine,among my biggest admirers,called it "Nick Hanauer's near-insane proposal."And yet, just 350 daysafter that article was published,Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into lawan ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattleto 15 dollars an hour,more than doublewhat the prevailing federal $7.25 rate is.How did this happen,reasonable people might ask.It happened because a group of usreminded the middle classthat they are the sourceof growth and prosperity in capitalist economies.businesses have more customers,and need more employees.We reminded them that when businessespay workers a living wage,taxpayers are relieved of the burdenof funding the poverty programslike food stamps and medical assistanceand rent assistancethat those workers need.We reminded them that low-wage workersmake terrible taxpayers,and that when you raise the minimum wagefor all businesses,all businesses benefityet all can compete.Now the orthodox reaction, of course,is raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right?Your politician's always echoingthat trickle-down idea by saying things like,"Well, if you raise the price of employment,guess what happens? You get less of it."Are you sure?Because there's some contravening evidence.Since 1980, the wages of CEOs in our countryhave gone from about 30 times the median wageto 500 times.That's raising the price of employment.And yet, to my knowledge,I have never seen a companyoutsource its CEO's job, automate their job,export the job to China.In fact, we appear to be employingmore CEOs and senior managers than ever before.So too for technology workersand financial services workers,who earn multiples of the median wageand yet we employ more and more of them,so clearly you can raise the price of employmentand get more of it.I know that most peoplethink that the $15 minimum wageis this insane, risky economic experiment.We disagree.We believe that the $15 minimum wagein Seattleis actually the continuationof a logical economic policy.It is allowing our cityto kick your city's ass.Because, you see,Washington state already hasthe highest minimum wageof any state in the nation.We pay all workers $9.32,which is almost 30 percent morethan the federal minimum of 7.25,but crucially, 427 percent morethan the federal tipped minimum of 2.13.If trickle-down thinkers were right,Seattle should be sliding into the ocean.And yet, Seattleis the fastest-growing big city in the country.Washington state is generating small business jobsat a higher rate than any other major statein the nation.The restaurant business in Seattle? Booming.Why? Because the fundamental law of capitalism is,when workers have more money,businesses have more customersand need more workers.When restaurants pay restaurant workers enoughso that even they can afford to eat in restaurants,that's not bad for the restaurant business.That's good for it,despite what some restaurateurs may tell you.Is it more complicated than I'm making out?Of course it is.There are a lot of dynamics at play.But can we please stop insistingthat if low-wage workers earn a little bit more,unemployment will skyrocketand the economy will collapse?There is no evidence for it.The most insidious thingabout trickle-down economicsis not the claim that if the rich get richer,everyone is better off.It is the claim made by those who opposeany increase in the minimum wagethat if the poor get richer,that will be bad for the economy.This is nonsense.So can we please dispense with this rhetoricthat says that rich guys like meand my plutocrat friendsmade our country?We plutocrats know,even if we don't like to admit it in public,that if we had been born somewhere else,not here in the United States,we might very well be just some dude standing barefootby the side of a dirt road selling fruit.even very, very poor places.It's just that that's allthat those entrepreneurs' customers can afford.So here's an idea for a new kind of economics,a new kind of politicsthat I call new capitalism.Let's acknowledge that capitalismbeats the alternatives,but also that the more people we include,both as entrepreneurs and as customers,the better it works.Let's by all means shrink the size of government,but not by slashing the poverty programs,but by ensuring that workers are paid enoughso that they actually don't need those programs.Let's invest enough in the middle classto make our economy fairer and more inclusive,and by fairer, more truly competitive,and by more truly competitive,more able to generate the solutionsto human problemsthat are the true drivers of growth and prosperity.Capitalism is the greatest social technologyever inventedfor creating prosperity in human societies,if it is well managed,but capitalism, because of the fundamentalmultiplicative dynamics of complex systems,tends towards, inexorably, inequality,concentration and collapse.The work of democraciesis to maximize the inclusion of the manyin order to create prosperity,not to enable the few to accumulate money.Government does create prosperity and growth,by creating the conditions that allowboth entrepreneurs and their customersto thrive.Balancing the power of capitalists like meand workers isn't bad for capitalism.It's essential to it.Programs like a reasonable minimum wage,affordable healthcare,paid sick leave,and the progressive taxation necessaryto pay for the important infrastructurenecessary for the middle class like education, R and D,these are indispensable toolsshrewd capitalists should embraceto drive growth, because no one benefits from itlike us.Many economists would have you believethat their field is an objective science.I disagree, and I think that it is equallya tool that humans useto enforce and encodeour social and moral preferences and prejudicesabout status and power,which is why plutocrats like mehave always needed to find persuasive storiesto tell everyone elseabout why our relative positionsare morally righteous and good for everyone:like, we are indispensable, the job creators,and you are not;like, tax cuts for us create growth,but investments in youwill balloon our debtand bankrupt our great country;that we matter;that you don't.For thousands of years, these stories were calleddivine right.Today, we have trickle-down economics.How obviously, transparently self-servingall of this is.We plutocrats need to seethat the United States of America made us,not the other way around;that a thriving middle class is the sourceof prosperity in capitalist economies,not a consequence of it.And we should never forgetare barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.Fellow plutocrats, I think it may be time for usto recommit to our country,to commit to a new kind of capitalismwhich is both more inclusive and more effective,a capitalism that will ensurethat America's economy remainsthe most dynamic and prosperous in the world.Let's secure the future for ourselves,our children and their children.Or alternatively, we could do nothing,hide in our gated communitiesand private schools,enjoy our planes and yachts— they're fun —and wait for the pitchforks.Thank you.(Applause)

What do you think of when I say the word "design"?You probably think of things like this,finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand,or maybe logos and posters and mapsthat visually explain things,classic icons of timeless design.But I'm not here to talk about that kind of design.I want to talk about the kindthat you probably use every dayand may not give much thought to,designs that change all the timeand that live inside your pocket.I'm talking about the designof digital experiencesand specifically the design of systemsthat are so big that their scalecan be hard to comprehend.Consider the fact that Google processesover one billion search queries every day,that every minute, over 100 hoursof footage are uploaded to YouTube.That's more in a single daythan all three major U.S. networks broadcastin the last five years combined.And Facebook transmitting the photos,messages and storiesof over 1.23 billion people.That's almost half of the Internet population,and a sixth of humanity.These are some of the productsthat I've helped design over the course of my career,and their scale is so massivethat they've produced unprecedenteddesign challenges.But what is really hardabout designing at scale is this:It's hard in part becauseit requires a combination of two things,audacity and humility —audacity to believe that the thing that you're makingis something that the entire world wants and needs,and humility to understand that as a designer,it's not about you or your portfolio,it's about the people that you're designing for,and how your work just might help themlive better lives.Now, unfortunately, there's no schoolthat offers the course Designing for Humanity 101.I and the other designerswho work on these kinds of productshave had to invent it as we go along,and we are teaching ourselvesthe emerging best practicesof designing at scale,and today I'd like share some of the thingsthat we've learned over the years.Now, the first thing that you need to knowabout designing at scaleis that the little things really matter.Here's a really good example of howa very tiny design element can make a big impact.The team at Facebook that managesthe Facebook "Like" buttondecided that it needed to be redesigned.The button had kind of gotten out of syncwith the evolution of our brandand it needed to be modernized.Now you might think, well, it's a tiny little button,it probably is a pretty straightforward,easy design assignment, but it wasn't.Turns out, there were all kinds of constraintsfor the design of this button.You had to be careful to make it workin a bunch of different languages,because it has to degrade gracefullyin old web browsers.The truth is, designing this tiny little buttonwas a huge pain in the butt.Now, this is the new version of the button,and the designer who led this project estimatesthat he spent over 280 hoursredesigning this button over the course of months.Now, why would we spend so much timeon something so small?It's because when you're designing at scale,there's no such thing as a small detail.This innocent little buttonis seen on average 22 billion times a dayand on over 7.5 million websites.Now that's a lot of pressure for a little buttonand the designer behind it,but with these kinds of products,you need to get even the tiny things right.Now, the next thing that you need to understandis how to design with data.Now, when you're working on products like this,you have incredible amounts of informationabout how people are using your productthat you can then use to influenceyour design decisions,but it's not just as simple as following the numbers.Let me give you an exampleso that you can understand what I mean.Facebook has had a tool for a long timethat allowed people to report photosthat may be in violation of our community standards,things like spam and abuse.And there were a ton of photos reported,but as it turns out,only a small percentage were actuallyin violation of those community standards.Most of them were just your typical party photo.Now, to give you a specific hypothetical example,let's say my friend Laura hypotheticallyuploads a picture of mefrom a drunken night of karaoke.This is purely hypothetical, I can assure you.(Laughter)Now, incidentally,you know how some people are kind of worriedthat their boss or employeeis going to discover embarrassing photos of themon Facebook?Do you know how hard that is to avoidwhen you actually work at Facebook?So anyway, there are lots of these photosbeing erroneously reported as spam and abuse,and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch.He really thought there was something else going onand he was right,he found that most of themwere from people who were requestingthe takedown of a photo of themselves.Now this was a scenario that the teamnever even took into account before.So they added a new featurethat allowed people to message their friendto ask them to take the photo down.But it didn't work.Only 20 percent of peoplesent the message to their friend.So the team went back at it.They consulted with experts in conflict resolution.They even studied the universal principlesof polite language,which I didn't even actually know existeduntil this research happened.And they found something really interesting.They had to go beyond just helping peopleask their friend to take the photo down.They had to help people express to their friendhow the photo made them feel.Here's how the experience works today.So I find this hypothetical photo of myself,and it's not spam, it's not abuse,but I really wish it weren't on the site.So I report it and I say,"I'm in this photo and I don't like it,"and then we dig deeper.Why don't you like this photo of yourself?And I select "It's embarrassing."And then I'm encouraged to message my friend,but here's the critical difference.I'm provided specific suggested languagethat helps me communicate to Laurahow the photo makes me feel.Now the team found that this relatively small changehad a huge impact.Before, only 20 percent of peoplewere sending the message,and now 60 percent were,and surveys showed that peopleon both sides of the conversationfelt better as a result.That same survey showedthat 90 percent of your friendswant to know if they've done something to upset you.Now I don't know who the other 10 percent are,but maybe that's where our "Unfriend" featurecan come in handy.So as you can see,these decisions are highly nuanced.Of course we use a lot of datato inform our decisions,but we also rely very heavily on iteration,research, testing, intuition, human empathy.It's both art and science.are called "data-driven,"which is a term that totally drives us bonkers.The fact is, it would be irresponsible of usnot to rigorously test our designswhen so many people are counting on usto get it right,but data analyticswill never be a substitute for design intuition.Data can help you make a good design great,but it will never made a bad design good.is that when you introduce change,you need to do it extraordinarily carefully.Now I often have joked thatI spend almost as much timedesigning the introduction of changeas I do the change itself,and I'm sure that we can all relate to thatwhen something that we use a lot changesand then we have to adjust.The fact is, people can becomevery efficient at using bad design,it's still incredibly frustrating when it happens,and this is particularly truewith user-generated content platforms,It is, after all, their content.Now, years ago, when I was working at YouTube,we were looking for ways toencourage more people to rate videos,we found that almost everyone was exclusively usingthe highest five-star rating,a handful of people were usingthe lowest one-star,and virtually no onewas using two, three or four stars.So we decided to simplifyinto an up-down kind of voting binary model.But people were very attachedto the five-star rating system.Video creators really loved their ratings.Millions and millions of peoplewere accustomed to the old design.So in order to help peopleprepare themselves for changeand acclimate to the new design more quickly,we actually published the data graphsharing with the communitythe rationale for what we were going to do,and it even engaged the larger industryin a conversation, which resulted inmy favorite TechCrunch headline of all time:"YouTube Comes to a 5-Star Realization:Its Ratings Are Useless."Now, it's impossible to completely avoidchange aversion when you're making changesto products that so many people use.Even though we tried to do all the right things,we still received our customary floodof video protests and angry emailsbut we have to rememberpeople care intensely about this stuff,and it's because these products, this work,really, really matters to them.Now, we know that we have to be carefulabout paying attention to the details,we have to be cognizant about how we use datain our design process,and we have to introduce changevery, very carefully.Now, these things are all really useful.They're good best practices for designing at scale.But they don't mean anythingif you don't understand somethingmuch more fundamental.You have to understand who you are designing for.Now, when you set a goal to designfor the entire human race,and you start to engage in that goal in earnest,at some point you run into the wallsof the bubble that you're living in.Now, in San Francisco, we get a little miffedwhen we hit a dead cell zonebecause we can't use our phones to navigateto the new hipster coffee shop.But what if you had to drive four hoursto charge your phonebecause you had no reliable source of electricity?What if you had no access to public libraries?What if your country had no free press?What would these products start to mean to you?This is what Google, YouTube and Facebooklook like to most of the world,and it's what they'll look liketo most of the next five billion peopleto come online.Designing for low-end cell phonesis not glamorous design work,but if you want to design for the whole world,you have to design for where people are,and not where you are.So how do we keep this big, big picture in mind?We try to travel outside of our bubble to see, hearand understand the people we're designing for.We use our products in non-English languagesto make sure that they work just as well.to keep in touch with their reality.So what does it mean to design at a global scale?It means difficult and sometimes exasperating workto try to improve and evolve products.can be pretty exhausting,and the humility part,it's a little tough on the design ego.Because these products are always changing,everything that I've designed in my careeris pretty much gone,and everything that I will design will fade away.But here's what remains:the never-ending thrillof being a part of something that is so big,you can hardly get your head around it,and the promise that it just might change the world.Thank you.(Applause)

I would like to share with youa new model of higher education,a model that, once expanded,can enhance the collective intelligenceof millions of creative and motivated individualsthat otherwise would be left behind.Look at the world.Pick up a place and focus on it.You will find humans chasing higher education.Let's meet some of them.Patrick.Patrick was born in Liberiato a family of 20 children.During the civil war, he and his family were forcedto flee to Nigeria.There, in spite of his situation,he graduated high school with nearly perfect grades.He wanted to continue to higher education,but due to his familyliving on the poverty line,he was soon sent to South Africato work and send back moneyto feed his family.Patrick never gave up his dream of higher education.Late at night, after work,he surfed the Net looking for ways to study.Meet Debbie.Debbie is from Florida.Her parents didn't go to college,and neither did any of her siblings.Debbie has worked all her life,pays taxes, supports herself month to month,proud of the American dream,a dream that just won't be completewithout higher education.But Debbie doesn't have the savingsfor higher education.She can't pay the tuition.Neither could she leave work.Meet Wael.Wael is from Syria.He's firsthand experiencingthe misery, fear and failureimposed on his country.He's a big believer in education.He knew that if he would find an opportunityfor higher education,an opportunity to get ahead of the rest,he has a better chance to survivein a world turned upside down.The higher education systemfailed Patrick, Debbie and Wael,exactly as it is failingmillions of potential students,millions that graduate high school,millions that are qualified for higher education,millions that want to studyyet cannot access for various reasons.First, financial.Universities are expensive. We all know it.In large parts of the world,higher education is unattainablefor an average citizen.This is probably the biggest problemfacing our society.Higher education stopped being a right for alland became a privilege for the few.Second, cultural.Students who are qualified for higher education,can afford, want to study, cannotbecause it is not decent,it is not a place for a woman.This is the story of countless womenin Africa, for example,prevented from higher educationbecause of cultural barriers.And here comes the third reason:UNESCO stated that in 2025,100 million studentswill be deprived from higher educationsimply because there will not be enough seatsto accommodate them, to meet the demand.They will take a placement test,they will pass it,but they still won't have accessbecause there are no places available.These are the reasonsI founded University of the People,a nonprofit, tuition-free,degree-granting universityto give an alternative,to create an alternative to those who have no other,an alternative that will be affordableand scalable,an alternative that will disruptthe current education system,open the gates to higher educationfor every qualified studentregardless of what they earn, where they live,or what society says about them.Patrick, Debbie and Waelare only three examplesout of the 1,700 accepted studentsfrom 143 countries.We — (Applause) — Thank you.We didn't need to reinvent the wheel.We just looked at what wasn't workingand used the amazing power of the Internetto get around it.We set out to build a modelthat will cut down almost entirelythe cost of higher education,and that's how we did it.First, bricks and mortar cost money.Universities have expensesthat virtual universities don't.We don't need to pass these expensesonto our students.They don't exist.We also don't need to worry about capacity.There are no limits of seatsin virtual university.Actually, nobody needs to standat the back of the lecture hall.Textbooks is also somethingour students don't need to buy.By using open educational resourcesand the generosity of professorswho are putting their materialfree and accessible,we don't need to send our students to buy textbooks.All of our materials come free.Even professors,come free to our students,over 3,000 of them,including presidents, vice chancellors,professors and academic advisorsfrom top universities such as NYU,Yale, Berkeley and Oxford,came on board to help our students.Finally, it's our belief in peer-to-peer learning.We use this sound pedagogical modelto encourage our students from all over the worldto interact and study togetherand also to reduce the timeour professors need to labor over class assignments.If the Internet has made us a global village,this model can develop its future leadership.Look how we do it.We only offer two programs:business administration and computer science,the two programsthat are most in demand worldwide,the two programs that are likeliestto help our students find a job.When our students are accepted,they are placed in a small classroomof 20 to 30 students to ensurethat those who need personalized attention get it.Moreover, for every nine weeks' course,they meet a new peer,a whole new set of studentsfrom all over the world.Every week, when they go into the classroom,they find the lecture notes of the week,the reading assignment, the homework assignment,and the discussion question,which is the core of our studies.Every week, every studentmust contribute to the class discussionand also must commenton the contribution of others.This way, we open our students' minds,we develop a positive shift in attitudetoward different cultures.By the end of each week,the students take a quiz,hand in their homework,which are assessed by their peersunder the supervision of the instructors,get a grade, move to the next week.By the end of the course, they take the final exam,get a grade, and follow to the next course.We opened the gates for higher educationfor every qualified student.Every student with a high school diploma,sufficient English and Internet connectioncan study with us.We don't use audio. We don't use video.Broadband is not necessary.Any student from any part of the worldwith any Internet connectioncan study with us.We are tuition-free.All we ask our students to coveris the cost of their exams,100 dollars per exam.A full-time bachelor degree studenttaking 40 courses,will pay 1,000 dollars a year,4,000 dollars for the entire degree,and for those who cannot afford even this,we offer them a variety of scholarships.It is our mission that nobody will be left behindfor financial reasons.With 5,000 students in 2016,this model is financially sustainable.Five years ago, it was a vision.Today, it is a reality.Last month, we got the ultimateacademic endorsement to our model.University of the People is now fully accredited.(Applause)Thank you.With this accreditation,it's our time now to scale up.We have demonstrated that our model works.I invite universities and, even more important,developing countries' governments,to replicate this modelto ensure that the gates of higher educationwill open widely.A new era is coming,an era that will witnessthe disruption of the higher education modelas we know it today,from being a privilege for the fewto becoming a basic right,affordable and accessible for all.Thank you.(Applause)

On March 10, 2011,I was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Labmeeting with faculty, students and staff,and we were trying to figure out whetherI should be the next director.That night, at midnight,a magnitude 9 earthquakehit off of the Pacific coast of Japan.My wife and family were in Japan,and as the news started to come in,I was panicking.I was looking at the news streamsand listening to the press conferencesof the government officialsand the Tokyo Power Company,and hearing about this explosionat the nuclear reactorsand this cloud of falloutthat was headed towards our housewhich was only about 200 kilometers away.And the people on TV weren't telling usanything that we wanted to hear.I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor,what was going on with the radiation,whether my family was in danger.So I did what instinctively felt like the right thing,which was to go onto the Internetand try to figure outif I could take matters into my own hands.On the Net, I found there were a lot of other peoplelike me trying to figure out what was going on,and together we sort of loosely formed a groupand we called it Safecast,and we decided we were going to tryto measure the radiationand get the data out to everybody else,because it was clear that the governmentwasn't going to be doing this for us.Three years later,we have 16 million data points,we have designed our own Geiger countersthat you can download the designsand plug it into the network.We have an app that shows youWe are arguably one of the most successfulcitizen science projects in the world,and we have createdthe largest open dataset of radiation measurements.And the interesting thing hereis how did — (Applause) — Thank you.How did a bunch of amateurswho really didn't know what we were doingsomehow come togetherand do what NGOs and the governmentwere completely incapable of doing?And I would suggest that this has something to dowith the Internet. It's not a fluke.It wasn't luck, and it wasn't because it was us.It helped that it was an eventthat pulled everybody together,but it was a new way of doing thingsthat was enabled by the Internetand a lot of the other things that were going on,and I want to talk a little bit aboutwhat those new principles are.So remember before the Internet? (Laughter)I call this B.I. Okay?So, in B.I., life was simple.Things were Euclidian, Newtonian,somewhat predictable.People actually tried to predict the future,even the economists.And then the Internet happened,and the world became extremely complex,extremely low-cost, extremely fast,and those Newtonian lawsthat we so dearly cherishedturned out to be just local ordinances,and what we found was that in thiscompletely unpredictable worldthat most of the people who were survivingwere working with sort of a different set of principles,and I want to talk a little bit about that.Before the Internet, if you remember,when we tried to create services,what you would do is you'd createand it would cost millions of dollarsto do anything that was substantial.what you would do is you'd get an MBAwho would write a planand get the moneyfrom V.C.s or big companies,and then you'd hire the designers and the engineers,and they'd build the thing.This is the Before Internet, B.I., innovation model.What happened after the Internet wasthe cost of innovation went down so muchthe cost of communication, and Moore's Lawmade it so that the cost of trying a new thingbecame nearly zero,and so you would have Google, Facebook, Yahoo,students that didn't have permission —permissionless innovation —didn't have permission, didn't have PowerPoints,they just built the thing,then they raised the money,and then they sort of figured out a business planand maybe later on they hired some MBAs.So the Internet caused innovation,at least in software and services,to go from an MBA-driven innovation modelto a designer-engineer-driven innovation model,and it pushed innovation to the edges,to the dorm rooms, to the startups,away from the large institutions,the stodgy old institutions that had the powerand the money and the authority.It turns out it's happening in other things, too.Let me give you some examples.So at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware.We do all kinds of things.We do biology, we do hardware,as opposed to "Publish or perish,"which was the traditional academic way of thinking.And he often said, the demo only has to work once,because the primary mode of us impacting the worldwas through large companiesbeing inspired by usBut today, with the abilityto deploy things into the real world at such low cost,I'm changing the motto now,and this is the official public statement.I'm officially saying, "Deploy or die."You have to get the stuff into the real worldfor it to really count,and sometimes it will be large companies,and Nicholas can talk about satellites.(Applause)Thank you.But we should be getting out there ourselvesand they sat on the factory floorswith the innovators in Shenzhen, and it was amazing.What was happening therewas you would have these manufacturing devices,and they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints.They were fiddling with the manufacturing equipmentThe factory was in the designer,and the designer was literally in the factory.And so what you would do is,you'd go down to the stallsand you would see these cell phones.So instead of starting little websiteslike the kids in Palo Alto do,the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones.They make new cell phones like kids in Palo Altomake websites,and so there's a rainforestof innovation going on in the cell phone.What they do is, they make a cell phone,go down to the stall, they sell some,they look at the other kids' stuff, go up,make a couple thousand more, go down.Doesn't this sound like a software thing?It sounds like agile software development,A/B testing and iteration,and what we thought you could only do with softwarekids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware.My next fellow, I hope, is going to beone of these innovators from Shenzhen.And so what you see isthat is pushing innovation to the edges.We talk about 3D printers and stuff like that,and that's great, but this is Limor.She is one of our favorite graduates,and she is standing in front of a SamsungTechwin Pick and Place Machine.This thing can put 23,000 components per houronto an electronics board.This is a factory in a box.So what used to take a factory full of workersworking by handin this little box in New York,she's able to have effectively —She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhento do this manufacturing.She can buy this box and she can manufacture it.So manufacturing, the cost of innovation,is getting so lowthat innovation is being pushed to the edgesand students and startups are being able to build it.This is a recent thing, but this will happenand this will changejust like it did with software.Sorona is a DuPont processthat uses a genetically engineered microbeto turn corn sugar into polyester.and it's much better for the environment.Genetic engineering and bioengineeringare creating a whole bunchof great new opportunitiesfor chemistry, for computation, for memory.but we will probably be growing chairsand buildings soon.and took seven years to build.It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days.The thing is, the cost of innovationin bioengineering is also going down.This is desktop gene sequencer.Now you can do it on a desktop like this,and kids can do this in dorm rooms.This is Gen9 gene assembler,and so right now when you try to print a gene,what you do is somebody in a factorywith pipettes puts the thing together by hand,you have one error per 100 base pairs,and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money.This new deviceassembles genes on a chip,and instead of one error per 100 base pairs,it's one error per 10,000 base pairs.In this lab, we will have the world's capacityof gene printing within a year,200 million base pairs a year.This is kind of like when we wentfrom transistor radios wrapped by handto the Pentium.pushing bioengineering into the handsof dorm rooms and startup companies.So it's happening in software and in hardwareand bioengineering,It's a bottom-up innovation, it's democratic,it's chaotic, it's hard to control.It's not bad, but it's very different,and I think that the traditional rules that we havefor institutions don't work anymore,and most of us hereoperate with a different set of principles.One of my favorite principles is the power of pull,which is the idea of pulling resourcesfrom the network as you need themrather than stocking them in the centerand controlling everything.So in the case of the Safecast story,but I was able to find Seanwho was the hackerspace community organizer,and Peter, the analog hardware hackerwho made our first Geiger counter,and Dan, who built the Three Mile IslandAnd these people I wouldn't have been able to findbeforehand and probably were betterthat I found them just in time from the network.I'm a three-time college dropout,so learning over educationis very near and dear to my heart,but to me, education is what people do to youand learning is what you do to yourself.(Applause)And it feels like, and I'm biased,it feels like they're trying to make you memorizeand to me, I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone,and it feels like they assumeyou're going to be on top of some mountainall by yourself with a number 2 penciltrying to figure out what to dowhen in fact you're always going to be connected,you're always going to have friends,and what you need to learn is how to learn.In the case of Safecast, a bunch of amateurswhen we started three years ago,I would argue that we probably as a groupknow more than any other organizationabout how to collect data and publish dataand do citizen science.Compass over maps.So this one, the idea is that the cost of writing a planor mapping something is getting so expensiveand it's not very accurate or useful.we knew we wanted to publish the data,and instead of trying to come up with the exact plan,we first said, oh, let's get Geiger counters.Oh, they've run out.Let's build them. There aren't enough sensors.Okay, then we can make a mobile Geiger counter.We can drive around. We can get volunteers.We don't have enough money. Let's Kickstarter it.We could not have planned this whole thing,but by having a very strong compass,we eventually got to where we were going,but this idea of compasses is very important.So I think the good news isthat even though the world is extremely complex,what you need to do is very simple.I think it's about stopping this notionthat you need to plan everything,you need to stock everything,and you need to be so prepared,and focus on being connected,always learning,fully aware,and super present.So I don't like the word "futurist."I think we should be now-ists,like we are right now.Thank you.(Applause)

and so my friends like to give me examplesof their frustrations with computing systems,especially frustrations related tounusable privacy and security.So passwords are something that I hear a lot about.A lot of people are frustrated with passwords,and it's bad enoughwhen you have to have one really good passwordthat you can rememberbut nobody else is going to be able to guess.But what do you do when you have accountson a hundred different systemsand you're supposed to have a unique passwordfor each of these systems?It's tough.At Carnegie Mellon, they used to make itactually pretty easy for usto remember our passwords.The password requirement up through 2009was just that you had to have a passwordwith at least one character.Pretty easy. But then they changed things,and at the end of 2009, they announcedthat we were going to have a new policy,and this new policy requiredpasswords that were at least eight characters long,with an uppercase letter, lowercase letter,a digit, a symbol,and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary.Now, when they implemented this new policy,a lot of people, my colleagues and friends,came up to me and they said, "Wow,now that's really unusable.Why are they doing this to us,and why didn't you stop them?"And I said, "Well, you know what?They didn't ask me."But I got curious, and I decided to go talkto the people in charge of our computer systemsand find out what led them to introducethis new policy,and they said that the universityhad joined a consortium of universities,and one of the requirements of membershipwas that we had to have stronger passwordsthat complied with some new requirements,and these requirements were that our passwordshad to have a lot of entropy.Now entropy is a complicated term,but basically it measures the strength of passwords.But the thing is, there isn't actuallya standard measure of entropy.has a set of guidelineswhich have some rules of thumbfor measuring entropy,but they don't have anything too specific,and the reason they only have rules of thumbis it turns out they don't actually have any good dataon passwords.In fact, their report states,"Unfortunately, we do not have much dataNIST would like to obtain more dataon the passwords users actually choose,to reveal password data to others."So this is a problem, but our research grouplooked at it as an opportunity.Maybe we can collect some good password dataand actually advance the state of the art here.So the first thing we did is,we got a bag of candy barsand we walked around campusand talked to students, faculty and staff,and asked them for informationabout their passwords.Now we didn't say, "Give us your password."No, we just asked them about their password.How long is it? Does it have a digit?Does it have a symbol?And were you annoyed at having to createa new one last week?So we got results from 470 students,faculty and staff,and indeed we confirmed that the new policywas very annoying,but we also found that people saidthey felt more secure with these new passwords.We found that most people knewand only 13 percent of them did,but disturbingly, 80 percent of peoplesaid they were reusing their password.Now, this is actually more dangerousthan writing your password down,So if you have to, write your passwords down,but don't reuse them.We also found some interesting thingsabout the symbols people use in passwords.So CMU allows 32 possible symbols,but as you can see, there's only a small numberthat most people are using,so we're not actually getting very much strengthfrom the symbols in our passwords.So this was a really interesting study,and now we had data from 470 people,but in the scheme of things,that's really not very much password data,and so we looked around to seewhere could we find additional password data?So it turns out there are a lot of peoplegoing around stealing passwords,and they often go and post these passwordson the Internet.So we were able to get accessto some of these stolen password sets.This is still not really ideal for research, though,because it's not entirely clearwhere all of these passwords came from,or exactly what policies were in effectwhen people created these passwords.So we wanted to find some better source of data.So we decided that one thing we could dois we could do a study and have peopleactually create passwords for our study.and this is a service where you can posta small job online that takes a minute,a few minutes, an hour,and pay people, a penny, ten cents, a few dollars,to do a task for you,and then you pay them through Amazon.com.So we paid people about 50 centsto create a password following our rulesand answering a survey,and then we paid them again to come backtwo days later and log inusing their password and answering another survey.So we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords,and we gave people a bunch of different policiesto create passwords with.So some people had a pretty easy policy,we call it Basic8,and here the only rule was that your passwordhad to have at least eight characters.Then some people had a much harder policy,and this was very similar to the CMU policy,that it had to have eight charactersincluding uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol,and pass a dictionary check.And one of the other policies we tried,and there were a whole bunch more,but one of the ones we tried was called Basic16,and the only requirement hereAll right, so now we had 5,000 passwords,and so we had much more detailed information.Again we see that there's only a small numberof symbols that people are actually usingin their passwords.We also wanted to get an idea of how strongthe passwords were that people were creating,but as you may recall, there isn't a good measureof password strength.So what we decided to do was to seehow long it would take to crack these passwordsusing the best cracking toolsthat the bad guys are using,or that we could find information aboutin the research literature.So to give you an idea of how bad guysgo about cracking passwords,they will steal a password filethat will have all of the passwordsin kind of a scrambled form, called a hash,and so what they'll do is they'll make a guessas to what a password is,run it through a hashing function,and see whether it matchesSo a dumb attacker will try every password in order.They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB,and this is going to take a really long timebefore they get any passwordsthat people are really likely to actually have.A smart attacker, on the other hand,does something much more clever.They look at the passwordsthat are known to be popularfrom these stolen password sets,and they guess those first.So they're going to start by guessing "password,"and then they'll guess "I love you," and "monkey,"and "12345678,"because these are the passwordsthat are most likely for people to have.In fact, some of you probably have these passwords.So what we foundby running all of these 5,000 passwords we collectedthrough these tests to see how strong they were,we found that the long passwordswere actually pretty strong,and the complex passwords were pretty strong too.However, when we looked at the survey data,we saw that people were really frustratedby the very complex passwords,and the long passwords were a lot more usable,and in some cases, they were actuallyeven stronger than the complex passwords.So this suggests that,instead of telling people that they needto put all these symbols and numbersand crazy things into their passwords,we might be better off just telling peopleto have long passwords.Now here's the problem, though:Some people had long passwordsthat actually weren't very strong.You can make long passwordsthat are still the sort of thingthat an attacker could easily guess.There has to be some additional requirements,and some of our ongoing research is looking atwhat additional requirements we should addto make for stronger passwordsthat also are going to be easy for peopleto remember and type.Another approach to getting people to havestronger passwords is to use a password meter.Here are some examples.You may have seen these on the Internetwhen you were creating passwords.We decided to do a study to find outwhether these password meters actually work.Do they actually help peoplehave stronger passwords,and if so, which ones are better?So we tested password meters that weredifferent sizes, shapes, colors,different words next to them,and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny.As you type a better password,the bunny dances faster and faster.So this was pretty fun.What we foundwas that password meters do work.(Laughter)Most of the password meters were actually effective,and the dancing bunny was very effective too,but the password meters that were the most effectivewere the ones that made you work harderbefore they gave you that thumbs up and saidyou were doing a good job,and in fact we found that mostof the password meters on the Internet todayare too soft.They tell you you're doing a good job too early,and if they would just wait a little bitbefore giving you that positive feedback,you probably would have better passwords.Now another approach to better passwords, perhaps,is to use pass phrases instead of passwords.and the cartoonist suggeststhat we should all use pass phrases,and if you look at the second row of this cartoon,you can see the cartoonist is suggestingthat the pass phrase "correct horse battery staple"would be a very strong pass phraseand something really easy to remember.He says, in fact, you've already remembered it.And so we decided to do a research studyto find out whether this was true or not.In fact, everybody who I talk to,who I mention I'm doing password research,they point out this cartoon."Oh, have you seen it? That xkcd.Correct horse battery staple."So we did the research study to seewhat would actually happen.So in our study, we used Mechanical Turk again,and we had the computer pick the random wordsin the pass phrase.Now the reason we did thisis that humans are not very goodat picking random words.If we asked a human to do it,they would pick things that were not very random.So we tried a few different conditions.In one condition, the computer pickedfrom a dictionary of the very common wordsin the English language,and so you'd get pass phrases like"try there three come."And we looked at that, and we said,"Well, that doesn't really seem very memorable."So then we tried picking wordsthat came from specific parts of speech,so how about noun-verb-adjective-noun.So you can get a pass phrase like"plan builds sure power"or "end determines red drug."And these seemed a little bit more memorable,and maybe people would like those a little bit better.We wanted to compare them with passwords,and these were nice and short, but as you can see,they don't really look very memorable.And then we decided to try something calleda pronounceable password.So here the computer picks random syllablesand puts them togetherso you have something sort of pronounceable,like "tufritvi" and "vadasabi."That one kind of rolls off your tongue.So these were random passwords that weregenerated by our computer.So what we found in this study was that, surprisingly,pass phrases were not actually all that good.People were not really better at rememberingthe pass phrases than these random passwords,and because the pass phrases are longer,they took longer to typeand people made more errors while typing them in.So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases.Sorry, all of you xkcd fans.On the other hand, we did findthat pronounceable passwordsworked surprisingly well,and so we actually are doing some more researchSo one of the problemswith some of the studies that we've doneis that because they're all doneusing Mechanical Turk,these are not people's real passwords.They're the passwords that they createdor the computer created for them for our study.And we wanted to know whether peoplewould actually behave the same waywith their real passwords.Not surprisingly, they were a little bit reluctantto share them with us,but we were actually able to work outa system with themwhere they put all of the real passwordsfor 25,000 CMU students, faculty and staff,into a locked computer in a locked room,not connected to the Internet,and they ran code on it that we wroteto analyze these passwords.They audited our code.They ran the code.And so we never actually sawanybody's password.We got some interesting results,and those of you Tepper students in the backwill be very interested in this.So we found that the passwords createdwere actually 1.8 times strongerthan those affiliated with the business school.We have lots of other really interestingdemographic information as well.The other interesting thing that we foundto the Mechanical Turk-generated passwords,there was actually a lot of similarities,and so this helped validate our research methodand show that actually, collecting passwordsusing these Mechanical Turk studiesis actually a valid way to study passwords.So that was good news.Okay, I want to close by talking aboutsome insights I gained while on sabbaticallast year in the Carnegie Mellon art school.One of the things that I didis I made a number of quilts,and I made this quilt here.It's called "Security Blanket."(Laughter)And this quilt has the 1,000most frequent passwords stolenfrom the RockYou website.And the size of the passwords is proportionalto how frequently they appearedin the stolen dataset.And what I did is I created this word cloud,and I went through all 1,000 words,and I categorized them intoloose thematic categories.And it was, in some cases,it was kind of difficult to figure outwhat category they should be in,and then I color-coded them.So here are some examples of the difficulty.So "justin."Is that the name of the user,their boyfriend, their son?Maybe they're a Justin Bieber fan.Or "princess."Is that a nickname?Are they Disney princess fans?Or maybe that's the name of their cat."Iloveyou" appears many timesin many different languages.There's a lot of love in these passwords.If you look carefully, you'll see there's alsosome profanity,but it was really interesting to me to seethat there's a lot more love than hatein these passwords.And there are animals,a lot of animals,and "monkey" is the most common animaland the 14th most popular password overall.And this was really curious to me,and I wondered, "Why are monkeys so popular?"And so in our last password study,any time we detected somebodycreating a password with the word "monkey" in it,And what we found out --we found 17 people so far, I think,who have the word "monkey" --We found out about a third of them saidthey have a pet named "monkey"or a friend whose nickname is "monkey,"and about a third of them saidthat they just like monkeysand monkeys are really cute.And that guy is really cute.So it seems that at the end of the day,when we make passwords,we either make something that's really easyto type, a common pattern,or things that remind us of the word passwordor the account that we've created the password for,or whatever.Or we think about things that make us happy,and we create our passwordbased on things that make us happy.And while this makes typingand remembering your password more fun,it also makes it a lot easierto guess your password.So I know a lot of these TED Talksare inspirationaland they make you think about nice, happy things,but when you're creating your password,try to think about something else.Thank you.(Applause)

There's a man by the name of CaptainWilliam Swensonfor his actions on September 8, 2009.On that day, a column of Americanand Afghan troopswere making their waythrough a part of Afghanistanto help protecta group of government officials,a group of Afghan government officials,who would be meeting with some localvillage elders.The column came under ambush,and was surrounded on three sides,and amongst many other things,Captain Swenson was recognizedfor running into live fireto rescue the woundedand pull out the dead.One of the people he rescued was a sergeant,and he and a comrade were making their wayto a medevac helicopter.And what was remarkable about this dayis, by sheer coincidence,one of the medevac medicshappened to have a GoPro camera on his helmetand captured the whole scene on camera.It shows Captain Swenson and his comradebringing this wounded soldierwho had received a gunshot to the neck.They put him in the helicopter,and then you see Captain Swenson bend overand give him a kissbefore he turns around to rescue more.I saw this, and I thought to myself,where do people like that come from?What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion,when you would want to do that.There's a love there,and I wanted to know why is it thatI don't have people that I work with like that?You know, in the military, they give medalsto people who are willing to sacrifice themselvesso that others may gain.In business, we give bonuses to peoplewho are willing to sacrifice othersso that we may gain.We have it backwards. Right?That's why they're attracted to the military.These better people are attractedto this concept of service.But that's completely wrong.What I learned was that it's the environment,and if you get the environment right,every single one of us has the capacityto do these remarkable things,and more importantly, others have that capacity too.I've had the great honor of getting to meetsome of these, who we would call heroes,who have put themselves and put their livesat risk to save others,and I asked them, "Why would you do it?Why did you do it?"And they all say the same thing:"Because they would have done it for me."It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation.So trust and cooperation are really important here.The problem with concepts of trust and cooperationis that they are feelings, they are not instructions.I can't simply say to you, "Trust me," and you will.It's not how it works. It's a feeling.So where does that feeling come from?If you go back 50,000 yearsto the Paleolithic era,to the early days of Homo sapiens,what we find is that the worldwas filled with danger,all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us.Nothing personal.Whether it was the weather,lack of resources,maybe a saber-toothed tiger,all of these things workingto reduce our lifespan.And so we evolved into social animals,where we lived together and worked togetherin what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe,where we felt like we belonged.And when we felt safe amongst our own,the natural reaction was trust and cooperation.There are inherent benefits to this.It means I can fall asleep at nightIf we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you,that means you won't watch for danger.Bad system of survival.The modern day is exactly the same thing.The world is filled with danger,things that are trying to frustrate our livesor reduce our success,reduce our opportunity for success.It could be the ups and downs in the economy,the uncertainty of the stock market.It could be a new technology that rendersyour business model obsolete overnight.Or it could be your competitionthat is sometimes trying to kill you.It's sometimes trying to put you out of business,but at the very minimumis working hard to frustrate your growthand steal your business from you.We have no control over these forces.These are a constant,and they're not going away.The only variable are the conditionsinside the organization,and that's where leadership matters,because it's the leader that sets the tone.When a leader makes the choiceto put the safety and livesof the people inside the organization first,to sacrifice their comforts and sacrificethe tangible results, so that the people remainand feel safe and feel like they belong,remarkable things happen.I was flying on a trip,and I was witness to an incidentwhere a passenger attempted to boardbefore their number was called,and I watched the gate agenttreat this man like he had broken the law,like a criminal.He was yelled at for attempting to boardone group too soon.So I said something.I said, "Why do you have treat us like cattle?Why can't you treat us like human beings?"And this is exactly what she said to me.She said, "Sir, if I don't follow the rules,I could get in trouble or lose my job."All she was telling meis that she doesn't feel safe.All she was telling me is thatshe doesn't trust her leaders.The reason we like flying Southwest Airlinesis not because they necessarily hire better people.It's because they don't fear their leaders.You see, if the conditions are wrong,we are forced to expend our own time and energyto protect ourselves from each other,and that inherently weakens the organization.When we feel safe inside the organization,we will naturally combine our talentsand our strengths and work tirelesslyto face the dangers outsideand seize the opportunities.The closest analogy I can giveto what a great leader is, is like being a parent.If you think about what being a great parent is,what do you want? What makes a great parent?We want to give our child opportunities,education, discipline them when necessary,all so that they can grow up and achieve morethan we could for ourselves.Great leaders want exactly the same thing.They want to provide their people opportunity,education, discipline when necessary,all so that they could achieve morethan we could ever imagine for ourselves.in New York City, a tech company,he makes the point thatif you had hard times in your family,We would never do it.Then why do we consider laying off peopleinside our organization?Charlie implemented a policyof lifetime employment.If you get a job at Next Jump,you cannot get fired for performance issues.In fact, if you have issues,they will coach you and they will give you support,just like we would with one of our childrenwho happens to come home with a C from school.It's the complete opposite.This is the reason so many peoplehave such a visceral hatred, anger,at some of these banking CEOsIt's not the numbers.They have violated this deep-seated social contract.We know that they allowed their peopleor worse, they sacrificed their peopleto protect their own interests.This is what so offends us, not the numbers.Would anybody be offended if we gavea $150 million bonus to Gandhi?How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa?Do we have an issue with that? None at all.None at all.Great leaders would never sacrificethe people to save the numbers.They would sooner sacrifice the numbersto save the people.Bob Chapman, who runsa large manufacturing company in the Midwestcalled Barry-Wehmiller,in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession,and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight.Now in a large manufacturing company,this is a big deal,and they could no longer afford their labor pool.They needed to save 10 million dollars,so, like so many companies today,the board got together and discussed layoffs.And Bob refused.You see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts.Bob believes in heart counts,and it's much more difficult to simply reducethe heart count.And so they came up with a furlough program.Every employee, from secretary to CEO,was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation.They could take it any time they wanted,and they did not have to take it consecutively.But it was how Bob announced the programthat mattered so much.He said, it's better that we should all suffer a littlethan any of us should have to suffer a lot,and morale went up.They saved 20 million dollars,and most importantly, as would be expected,the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate.And quite spontaneously, nobody expected,people started trading with each other.Those who could afford it morewould trade with those who could afford it less.People would take five weeksso that somebody else only had to take three.Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank.I know many people at the seniormostlevels of organizationswho are absolutely not leaders.They are authorities, and we do what they saybecause they have authority over us,but we would not follow them.And I know many peoplewho are at the bottoms of organizationswho have no authorityand they are absolutely leaders,and this is because they have chosen to look afterthe person to the left of them,and they have chosen to look afterthe person to the right of them.This is what a leader is.I heard a storyof some Marineswho were out in theater,and as is the Marine custom,the officer ate last,and he let his men eat first,and when they were done,there was no food left for him.And when they went back out in the field,his men brought him some of their foodso that he may eat,because that's what happens.We call them leaders because they go first.We call them leaders because they take the riskbefore anybody else does.We call them leaders because they will chooseto sacrifice so that their peoplemay be safe and protectedand so their people may gain,and when we do, the natural responseis that our people will sacrifice for us.They will give us their blood and sweat and tearsto see that their leader's vision comes to life,and when we ask them, "Why would you do that?Why would you give your blood and sweat and tearsfor that person?" they all say the same thing:"Because they would have done it for me."And isn't that the organizationwe would all like to work in?Thank you very much.Thank you. (Applause)Thank you. (Applause)

1458879

So today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank,and it's clear that the general public needs guidance,because the average bank robbery netsonly 7,500 dollars.Rank amateurs who know nothingabout how to cook the books.The folks who know, of course,run our largest banks,and in the last go-around,they cost us over 11 trillion dollars.That's what 11 trillion looks like.That's how many zeros?And cost us over 10 million jobs as well.So our task is to educate ourselvesso that we can understandwhy we have these recurrent,intensifying financial crises,and how we can prevent them in the future.And the answer to that isthat we have to stop epidemics of control fraud.Control fraud is what happenswhen the people who control,typically a CEO,a seemingly legitimate entity,use it as a weapon to defraud.And these are the weapons of mass destructionin the financial world.They also follow in finance a particular strategy,because the weapon of choice in financeis accounting,and there is a recipe for accountingcontrol fraud, and how it occurs.And we discovered this recipeFirst ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy;second, by making or buying really crappy loans,but loans that are made at a very high interest rateor yield;three, while employing extreme leverage --that just means a lot of debt --compared to your equity;and four, while providing only trivial loss reservesagainst the inevitable losses.If you follow those four simple steps,and any bank can follow them,then you are mathematically guaranteedto have three things occur.The first thing isyou will report record bank profits --not just high, record.by modern executive compensation.And three, farther down the road,the bank will suffer catastrophic lossesand will fail unless it is bailed out.And that's a hint as to howwe discovered this recipe,During the savings and loan debacle in 1984,we looked at every single failure,and we looked for common characteristics,and we discovered this recipe was commonto each of these frauds.In other words, a coroner could find these thingsbecause this is a fatal recipethat will destroy the banksas well as the economy.And it also turns out to be preciselywhat could have stopped this crisis,the one that cost us 11 trillion dollarsjust in the household sector,that cost us 10 million jobs,was the easiest financial crisis by farto have avoided completelyif we had simply learned the lessonsof epidemics of control fraud,particularly using this recipe.So let's go to this crisis,and the two huge epidemicsof loan origination fraud that drove the crisis --appraisal fraud and liar's loans --and what we're going to seein looking at both of these iswe got warnings that were incredibly earlyabout these frauds.because back in the savings and loan debacle,we had figured out how to respondand prevent these crises.And three, the warnings were unambiguous.They were obvious that what was going onwas an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up.Let's take appraisal fraud first.This is simply where you inflate the valueof the home that is being pledgedas security for the loan.In 2000, the year 2000,that is over a year before Enron fails, by the way,the honest appraisers got together a formal petitionbegging the federal government to act,and the industry to act,to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud.And the appraisers explained how it was occurring,that banks were demanding that appraisersinflate the appraisal,and that if the appraisers refused to do so,they, the banks, would blacklisthonest appraisersand refuse to use them.Now, we've seen this beforein the savings and loan debacle,and we know that this kind of fraudcan only originate from the lenders,and that no honest lender would ever inflatethe appraisal,because it's the great protection against loss.So this was an incredibly early warning, 2000.It was something we'd seen before,and it was completely unambiguous.This was an epidemic of accounting control fraudled by the banks.What about liar's loans?Well, that warning actually comes earlier.The savings and loan debacle is basicallythe early 1980s through 1993,and in the midst of fighting that waveof accounting control fraud,in 1990, we found that a second frontof fraud was being started.And like all good financial frauds in America,it began in Orange County, California.And we happened to be the regional regulators for it.And our examiners said,they are making loans without even checkingwhat the borrower's income is.This is insane, it has to lead to massive losses,and it only makes sense for entities engagedin these accounting control frauds.And we said, yeah, you're absolutely right,and we drove those liar's loansout of the industry in 1990 and 1991,but we could only deal with the industrywe had jurisdiction over,which was savings and loans,and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds,Long Beach Savings, voluntarily gave upits federal savings and loan charter,gave up federal deposit insurance,converted to become a mortgage bankfor the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction,and changed its name to Ameriquest,and became the most notoriousof the liar's loans frauds early on,and to add to that,they deliberately predated upon minorities.So we knew again about this crisis.We'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before.We had incredibly early warnings of it,and it was absolutely unambiguousSo let's take a look at the reactionof the industry and the regulatorsand the prosecutors to these clearearly warnings that could have prevented the crisis.Start with the industry.The industry responded between 2003 and 2006by increasing liar's loansby over 500 percent.These were the loansthat hyperinflated the bubbleand produced the economic crisis.By 2006, half of all the loans called subprimewere also liar's loans.They're not mutually exclusive, it's just that together,they're the most toxic combinationyou can possibly imagine.By 2006, 40 percent of all the loansmade that year, all the home loans made that year,were liar's loans,40 percent.And this is despite a warningfrom the industry's own antifraud expertsthat said that these loans were an open invitationto fraudsters,and that they had a fraud incidenceof 90 percent,nine zero.In response to that, the industryfirst started calling these loans liar's loans,which lacks a certain subtlety,and second, massively increased them,and no government regulator everrequired or encouraged any lenderto make a liar's loanor anyone to purchase a liar's loan,and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie.This came from the lendersbecause of the fraud recipe.What happened to appraisal fraud?It expanded remarkably as well.By 2007, when a survey of appraisers was done,90 percent of appraisers reportedthat they had been subject to coercionfrom the lenders trying to get themto inflate an appraisal.In other words, both forms of fraudbecame absolutely endemic and normal,and this is what drove the bubble.What happened in the governmental sector?Well, the government, as I told you,when we were the savings and loan regulators,we could only deal with our industry,we couldn't do anything to them.Congress, it may strike you as impossible,but actually did something intelligent in 1994,that gave the Fed, and only the Federal Reserve,the explicit, statutory authority to ban liar's loansby every lender,whether or not they had federal deposit insurance.So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan,as chairs of the Fed, dowhen they got these warningsthat these were massively fraudulent loansRemember, there's no fraud exorcist.Once it starts out a fraudulent loan,it can only be sold to the secondary marketthrough more frauds,lying about the reps and warrantees,and then those people are going to producemortgage-backed securitiesand exotic derivativeswhich are also going to be supposedly backedby those fraudulent loans.So the fraud is going to progressthrough the entire system,hyperinflate the bubble, produce a disaster.And remember, we had experience with this.We had seen significant losses,and we had experience of competent regulatorsin stopping it.Greenspan and Bernanke refusedto use the authority under the statuteto stop liar's loans.And this was a matter first of dogma.They're just horrifically opposedto anything regulatory.But it is also the international competition in laxity,the race to the bottombetween the United States and the United Kingdom,the city of London, in particular,and the city of London won that race to the bottom,but it meant that all regulation in the Westwas completely degradedin this stupid competition to bewho could have the weakest regulation.So that was the regulatory response.What about the response of the prosecutorsafter the crisis,after 11 trillion dollars in losses,after 10 million jobs lost,a crisis in which the losses and the fraudswere more than 70 times largerthan the savings and loan debacle?Well, in the savings and loan debacle,our agency that regulated savings and loans, OTS,made over 30,000 criminal referrals,produced over 1,000 felony convictionsjust in cases designated as major,and that understates the degree of prioritization,because we worked with the FBIto create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes,the absolute worst of the worst, nationwide.Roughly 300 savings and loans involved,roughly 600 senior officials.Virtually all of them were prosecuted.We had a 90 percent conviction rate.It's the greatest success againstelite white collar criminals ever,and it was because of this understandingof control fraudand the accounting control fraud mechanism.Flash forward to the current crisis.The same agency, Office of Thrift Supervision,which was supposed to regulatemany of the largest makers of liar's loansin the country,has made, even today -- it no longer exists,but as of a year ago,it had made zero criminal referrals.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,has made zero criminal referrals.The Fed appears to have madezero criminal referrals.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationis smart enough to refuse to answer the question.Without any guidance from the regulators,there's no expertise in the FBIto investigate complex frauds.It isn't simply that they've hadto reinvent the wheelof how to do these prosecutions;they've forgotten that the wheel exists,and therefore, we have zero prosecutions,and of course, zero convictions,of any of the elite bank frauds,the Wall Street types,that drove this crisis.With no expertise coming from the regulators,the FBI formed what it calls a partnershipwith the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2007.The Mortgage Bankers Associationis the trade association of the perps.And the Mortgage Bankers Associationset out, it had the audacity and the successto con the FBI.It had created a supposed definitionof mortgage fraud, in which, guess what,its members are always the victimand never the perpetrators.And the FBI has bought this hook, line, sinker,rod, reel and the boat they rode out in.And so the FBI,under the leadership of an attorney generalwho is African-Americanhave adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis,in which it is the first virgin crisis in history,conceived without sin in the executive ranks.And it's those oh-so-clever hairdresserswho were able to defraud the poor, pitiful banks,who lack any financial sophistication.It is the silliest story you can conceive of,and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers,and they leave the banksters alone entirely.And so, while lions are roaming the campsite,the FBI is chasing mice.What do we need to do?What can we do in all of this?We need to change the perverse incentive structuresthat produce these recurrent epidemicsof accounting control fraudthat are driving our crises.So we have to first get ridof the systemically dangerous institutions.These are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions.We need to shrink them to the point,within the next five years,that they no longer pose a systemic risk.Right now, they are ticking time bombsthat will cause a global crisisas soon as the next one fails --not if, when.Second thing we need to do is completely reformmodern executive and professional compensation,which is what they use to suborn the appraisers.Remember, they were pressuring the appraisersthrough the compensation system,trying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic,in which bad ethics drives good ethicsout of the marketplace.And they largely succeeded,which is how the fraud became endemic.And the third thing that we need to dois deal with what we call the three D's:deregulation, desupervision,and the de facto decriminalization.Because we can makeall three of these changes, and if we do so,we can dramatically reducehow often we have a crisisand how severe those crises are.That is not simply critical to our economy.You can see what these crises do to inequalityand what they do to our democracy.They have produced crony capitalism,American-style,in which the largest financial institutionsare the leading financial donors of both parties,and that's the reason whyeven after this crisis,70 times larger than the savings and loan crisis,we have no meaningful reformsin any of the three areas that I've talked about,other than banning liar's loans,which is good,but that's just one form of ammunitionfor this fraud weapon.There are many forms of ammunition they can use.That's why we need to learnwhat the bankers have learned:the recipe for the best way to rob a bank,so that we can stop that recipe,because our legislators,who are dependent on political contributions,will not do it on their own.Thank you very much.(Applause)

So it's 2006.My friend Harold Ford calls me.He's running for U.S. Senate in Tennessee,and he says, "Mellody, I desperately need some national press. Do you have any ideas?"So I had an idea. I called a friendwho was in New Yorkand she said, "Why don't we hostan editorial board lunch for Harold?You come with him."Harold and I arrive in New York.We are in our best suits.We look like shiny new pennies.And we get to the receptionist, and we say,"We're here for the lunch."She motions for us to follow her.We walk through a series of corridors,and all of a sudden we find ourselvesin a stark room,at which point she looks at us and she says,"Where are your uniforms?"Just as this happens,my friend rushes in.The blood drains from her face.There are literally no words, right?And I look at her, and I say,"Now, don't you think we needmore than one black person in the U.S. Senate?"Now Harold and I --(Applause) —we still laugh about that story,and in many ways, the moment caught me off guard,but deep, deep down inside,I actually wasn't surprised.And I wasn't surprised because of somethingmy mother taught me about 30 years before.You see, my mother was ruthlessly realistic.where I was the only black kid invited,like, "Did you have fun?" or "How was the cake?"my mother looked at me and she said,"How did they treat you?"I was seven. I did not understand.I mean, why would anyone treat me differently?But she knew.And she looked me right in the eye and she said,"They will not always treat you well."Now, race is one of those topics in Americathat makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable.You bring it up at a dinner partyor in a workplace environment,it is literally the conversational equivalentof touching the third rail.There is shock,followed by a long silence.And even coming here today,I told some friends and colleaguesthat I planned to talk about race,and they warned me, they told me, don't do it,that there'd be huge risksin me talking about this topic,that people might think I'm a militant black womanand I would ruin my career.And I have to tell you,I actually for a moment was a bit afraid.Then I realized,the first step to solving any problemis to not hide from it,and the first step to any form of actionis awareness.And so I decided to actually talk about race.some of my experiences,that maybe we could all be a little less anxiousand a little more boldin our conversations about race.Now I know there are people out there who will saythat the election of Barack Obama meantthat it was the end of racial discriminationfor all eternity, right?But I work in the investment business,and we have a saying:The numbers do not lie.And here, there are significant,quantifiable racial disparitiesthat cannot be ignored,in household wealth, household income,job opportunities, healthcare.One example from corporate America:Even though white menmake up just 30 percent of the U.S. population,they hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats.Of the Fortune 250,there are only seven CEOs that are minorities,only two are chaired by black women,and you're looking at one of them,the same one who, not too long ago,was nearly mistaken for kitchen help.So that is a fact.Now I have this thought experimentthat I play with myself, when I say,imagine if I walked you into a roomand it was of a major corporation, like ExxonMobil,you would think that were weird.But if I walked you into a Fortune 500 company,and everyone around the table is a white male,when will it be that we think that's weird too?And I know how we got here.(Applause)I know how we got here.You know, there was institutionalized,at one time legalized, discrimination in our country.There's no question about it.But still, as I grapple with this issue,my mother's question hangs in the air for me:How did they treat you?Now, I do not raise this issue to complainor in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy.I have succeeded in my lifebeyond my wildest expectations,and I have been treated well by people of all racesmore often than I have not.I tell the uniform story because it happened.because they are real,and I stand here todaytalking about this issue of racial discriminationbecause I believe it threatens to robanother generation of all the opportunitiesthat all of us want for all of our children,no matter what their coloror where they come from.And I think it also threatens to hold back businesses.You see, researchers have coined this term"color blindness"to describe a learned behavior where we pretendthat we don't notice race.If you happen to be surrounded by a bunch of peoplewho look like you, that's purely accidental.Now, color blindness, in my view,doesn't mean that there's no racial discrimination,and there's fairness.It doesn't mean that at all. It doesn't ensure it.In my view, color blindness is very dangerousbecause it means we're ignoring the problem.There was a corporate study that said that,instead of avoiding race,They actually recognize that embracing diversitymeans recognizing all races,including the majority one.But I'll be the first one to tell you,this subject matter can be hard,awkward, uncomfortable -- but that's kind of the point.In the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes,the one that black people don't like to swim,I'm going to tell you how much I love to swim.I love to swim so muchthat as an adult, I swim with a coach.And one day my coach had me do a drillwhere I had to swim to one end of a 25-meter poolwithout taking a breath.And every single time I failed,I had to start over.And I failed a lot.By the end, I got it, but when I got out of the pool,I was exasperated and tired and annoyed,that was not a breath-holding exercise.That drill was to make you comfortablebeing uncomfortable,because that's how most of us spend our days."If we can learn to deal with our discomfort,and just relax into it,we'll have a better life.So I think it's time for us to be comfortablewith the uncomfortable conversation about race:black, white, Asian, Hispanic,male, female, all of us,if we truly believe in equal rightsand equal opportunity in America,I think we have to have real conversationsabout this issue.We cannot afford to be color blind.We have to be color brave.We have to be willing, as teachers and parentsand entrepreneurs and scientists,we have to be willing to haveproactive conversations about racewith honesty and understanding and courage,not because it's the right thing to do,but because it's the smart thing to do,because our businesses and our productsand our science, our research,all of that will be better with greater diversity.Now, my favorite example of color braveryis a guy named John Skipper.He runs ESPN.He's a North Carolina native,quintessential Southern gentleman, white.He joined ESPN, which already had a cultureof inclusion and diversity, but he took it up a notch.He demanded that every open positionhave a diverse slate of candidates.Now he says the senior peoplein the beginning bristled,and they would come to him and say,"Do you want me to hire the minority,And Skipper says his answers were always the same:"Yes."And by saying yes to diversity,I honestly believe that ESPNis the most valuable cable franchise in the world.I think that's a part of the secret sauce.Now I can tell you, in my own industry,at Ariel Investments, we actually view our diversityas a competitive advantage,He is the first person to developa mathematical calculation for diversity.really hard,that you should have a diverse group of people,including those with diverse intellects.The example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic.When it was ravaging Europe,they brought together all these scientists,and they were stumped.And the beginnings of the cure to the diseasecame from the most unlikely source,a dairy farmer who noticed that the milkmaidswere not getting smallpox.And the smallpox vaccination is bovine-basedbecause of that dairy farmer.Now I'm sure you're sitting here and you're saying,I don't run a cable company,I don't run an investment firm,I am not a dairy farmer.What can I do?And I'm telling you, you can be color brave.If you're part of a hiring processor an admissions process,you can be color brave.If you are trying to solve a really hard problem,you can speak up and be color brave.Now I know people will say,but that doesn't add up to a lot,observe your environment,at work, at school, at home.I'm asking you to look at the people around youpurposefully and intentionally.Invite people into your lifewho don't look like you, don't think like you,don't act like you,don't come from where you come from,and make you grow as a person.You might get powerful new insightsfrom these individuals,or, like my husband, who happens to be white,you might learn that black people,men, women, children,we use body lotion every single day.Now, I also think that this is very importantso that the next generation really understandsthat this progress will help them,Now, I told you, my mother,she was ruthlessly realistic.She was an unbelievable role model.She was the kind of personwho got to be the way she wasbecause she was a single momwith six kids in Chicago.She was in the real estate business,where she worked extraordinarily hardbut oftentimes had a hard time making ends meet.And that meant sometimes we gotour phone disconnected,or our lights turned off,or we got evicted.When we got evicted, sometimes we livedin these small apartments that she owned,sometimes in only one or two rooms,because they weren't completed,and we would heat our bathwater on hot plates.But she never gave up hope, ever,and she never allowed us to give up hope either.This brutal pragmatism that she had,I mean, I was four and she told me,"Mommy is Santa." (Laughter)She was this brutal pragmatism.She taught me so many lessons,but the most important lessonwas that every single day she told me,"Mellody, you can be anything."And because of those words,I would wake up at the crack of dawn,and because of those words,I would love school more than anything,and because of those words, when I was on a busgoing to school, I dreamed the biggest dreams.full of passion,asking you to be brave for the kidswho are dreaming those dreams today.(Applause)You see, I want them to look at a CEO on televisionand say, "I can be like her,"or, "He looks like me."And I want them to knowthat anything is possible,that they can achieve the highest levelthat they ever imagined,or they can lead any company.You see this idea of being the landof the free and the home of the brave,it's woven into the fabric of America.America, when we have a challenge,we take it head on, we don't shrink away from it.We take a stand. We show courage.So right now, what I'm asking you to do,I'm asking you to show courage.I'm asking you to be bold.As business leaders, I'm asking younot to leave anything on the table.I'm asking you not to be color blind,but to be color brave,so that every child knows that their future mattersand their dreams are possible.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. (Applause)

what I did was, I asked Bill and Melindato dig out from their archivesome images that would help explainsome of what they've done,and do a few things that way.So, we're going to start here.Melinda, when and where was this,and who is that handsome man next to you?Melinda Gates: With those big glasses, huh?This is in Africa, our very first trip,the first time either of us had ever been to Africa,in the fall of 1993.We were already engaged to be married.We married a few months later,and this was the trip where we really went to seethe animals and to see the savanna.It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much timeoff from work.But what really touched us, actually, were the people,and the extreme poverty.We started asking ourselves questions.Does it have to be like this?And at the end of the trip,we went out to Zanzibar,and took some time to walk on the beach,which is something we had done a lotwhile we were dating.And we'd already been talking about during that timethat the wealth that had come from Microsoftwould be given back to society,but it was really on that beach walkthat we started to talk about, well,what might we do and how might we go about it?CA: So, given that this vacationled to the creation ofthe world's biggest private foundation,it's pretty expensive as vacations go. (Laughter)MG: I guess so. We enjoyed it.CA: Which of you was the key instigator here,or was it symmetrical?Bill Gates: Well, I think we were excitedthat there'd be a phase of our lifewhere we'd get to work togetherand figure out how to give this money back.At this stage, we were talking about the poorest,and could you have a big impact on them?Were there things that weren't being done?There was a lot we didn't know.Our naïveté is pretty incredible,when we look back on it.But we had a certain enthusiasmthat that would be the phase,the post-Microsoft phasewould be our philanthropy.MG: Which Bill always thought was going to comeafter he was 60,so he hasn't quite hit 60 yet,so some things change along the way.CA: So it started there, but it got accelerated.So that was '93, and it was '97, really,before the foundation itself started.MA: Yeah, in '97, we read an articleand we kept saying to ourselves,"Well that can't be.In the U.S., you just go down to the drug store."And so we started gathering scientistsand started learning about population,learning about vaccines,learning about what had worked and what had failed,and that's really when we got going,was in late 1998, 1999.CA: So, you've got a big pot of moneyand a world full of so many different issues.How on Earth do you decide what to focus on?BG: Well, we decided that we'd pick two causes,whatever the biggest inequity was globally,and there we looked at children dying,children not having enough nutrition to ever develop,and countries that were really stuck,because with that level of death,and parents would have so many kidsthat they'd get huge population growth,and that the kids were so sickthat they really couldn't be educatedand lift themselves up.So that was our global thing,and then in the U.S.,both of us have had amazing educations,and we saw that as the way that the U.S.could live up to its promise of equal opportunityis by having a phenomenal education system,and the more we learned, the more we realizedwe're not really fulfilling that promise.And so we picked those two things,and everything the foundation doesis focused there.CA: So, I asked each of you to pick an imagethat you like that illustrates your work,and Melinda, this is what you picked.What's this about?MG: So I, one of the things I love to do when I travelis to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women,and I go in as a Western woman without a name.I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis.And I kept hearing from women,over and over and over, the more I traveled,"I want to be able to use this shot."and they would bring the conversation around to"But what about the shot I get?"which is a contraceptive.and they'd say, "Oh no, contraceptivesare stocked in in the developing world."Well, you had to dig deeper into the reports,and this is what the team came to me with,which is, to have the number one thingthat women tell you in Africa they want to usestocked out more than 200 days a yearexplains why women were saying to me,and I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there."And so condoms were stocked in in Africabecause of all the AIDS work that the U.S.and others supported.But women will tell you over and over again,"I can't negotiate a condom with my husband.I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS,and I need that tool because then I can spacethe births of my children, and I can feed themand have a chance of educating them."CA: Melinda, you're Roman Catholic,and you've often been embroiledin controversy over this issue,and on the abortion question,on both sides, really.How do you navigate that?MG: Yeah, so I think that's a really important point,which is, we had backed away from contraceptivesas a global community.We knew that 210 million womenwere saying they wanted access to contraceptives,and we weren't providing thembecause of the political controversy in our country,and to me that was just a crime,and I kept looking around trying to find the personthat would get this back on the global stage,and I finally realized I just had to do it.And even though I'm Catholic,I believe in contraceptiveswho report using contraceptives,and I shouldn't let that controversybe the thing that holds us back.We used to have consensus in the United Statesaround contraceptives,and so we got back to that global consensus,and actually raised 2.6 billion dollarsaround exactly this issue for women.(Applause)CA: Bill, this is your graph. What's this about?BG: Well, my graph has numbers on it.(Laughter)I really like this graph.This is the number of childrenwho die before the age of five every year.And what you find is reallya phenomenal success storywhich is not widely known,that we are making incredible progress.We go from 20 millionnot long after I was bornto now we're down to about six million.So this is a storylargely of vaccines.Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year.That was eradicated, so that got down to zero.Measles was killing a couple million a year.That's down to a few hundred thousand.Anyway, this is a chartwhere you want to get that number to continue,and it's going to be possible,using the science of new vaccines,getting the vaccines out to kids.We can actually accelerate the progress.The last decade,that number has dropped fasterthan ever in history,and so I just love the fact thatyou can say, okay, if we can invent new vaccines,we can get them out there,use the very latest understanding of these things,CA: I mean, you do the math on this,and it works out, I think, literallyto thousands of kids' lives saved every daycompared to the prior year.It's not reported.An airliner with 200-plus deathsis a far, far bigger story than that.Does that drive you crazy?BG: Yeah, because it's a silent thing going on.It's a kid, one kid at a time.Ninety-eight percent of thishas nothing to do with natural disasters,and yet, people's charity,when they see a natural disaster, are wonderful.It's incredible how people think, okay,that could be me, and the money flows.These causes have been a bit invisible.Now that the Millennium Development Goalsand various things are getting out there,we are seeing some increased generosity,so the goal is to get this well below a million,which should be possible in our lifetime.CA: Maybe it needed someonewho is turned on by numbers and graphsrather than just the big, sad faceto get engaged.I mean, you've used it in your letter this year,you used basically this argument to say that aid,contrary to the current memethat aid is kind of worthless and broken,that actually it has been effective.BG: Yeah, well people can take,there is some aid that was well-meaningand didn't go well.There's some venture capital investmentsthat were well-meaning and didn't go well.You shouldn't just say, okay, because of that,because we don't have a perfect record,this is a bad endeavor.You should look at, what was your goal?How are you trying to uplift nutritionand survival and literacyso these countries can take care of themselves,and say wow, this is going well,and be smarter.We can spend aid smarter.It is not all a panacea.We can do better than venture capital, I think,including big hits like this.CA: Traditional wisdom is thatit's pretty hard for married couples to work together.How have you guys managed it?MG: Yeah, I've had a lot of women say to me,"I really don't think I could work with my husband.That just wouldn't work out."You know, we enjoy it, and we don't --this foundation has been a coming to for both of usin its continuous learning journey,and we don't travel together as muchfor the foundation, actually, as we used towhen Bill was working at Microsoft.but I always know when I come home,Bill's going to be interested in what I learned,whether it's about women or girlsor something new about the vaccine delivery chain,or this person that is a great leader.He's going to listen and be really interested.And he knows when he comes home,even if it's to talk about the speech he didor the data or what he's learned,I'm really interested,But we don't every minute together, that's for sure.(Laughter)CA: But now you are, and we're very happy that you are.Melinda, early on, you were basicallylargely running the show.Six years ago, I guess,Bill came on full time, so moved from Microsoftand became full time.That must have been hard,adjusting to that. No?MG: Yeah. I think actually,for the foundation employees,there was way more angst for themthan there was for me about Bill coming.I was actually really excited.I mean, Bill made this decisioneven obviously before it got announced in 2006,and it was really his decision,but again, it was a beach vacationwhere we were walking on the beachand he was starting to think of this idea.And for me, the excitement of Billputting his brain and his heartagainst these huge global problems,these inequities, to me that was exciting.Yes, the foundation employees had angst about that.(Applause)CA: That's cool.MG: But that went away within three months,once he was there.BG: Including some of the employees.MG: That's what I said, the employees,BG: A few of them did, but —(Laughter)CA: So what do you guys argue about?Sunday, 11 o'clock,you're away from work,what comes up? What's the argument?BG: Because we built this thingtogether from the beginning,it's this great partnership.I had that with Paul Allenin the early days of Microsoft.I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger,and now Melinda, and in even stronger,equal ways, is the partner,so we talk a lot aboutwhich things should we give more to,which groups are working well?She's got a lot of insight.She'll sit down with the employees a lot.We'll take the different trips she described.So there's a lot of collaboration.I can't think of anything where one of ushad a super strong opinionabout one thing or another?You never know.MG: Well, here's the thing.We come at things from different angles,and I actually think that's really good.So Bill can look at the big dataFor me, I come at it from intuition.I meet with lots of people on the groundand Bill's taught me to take thatand read up to the global data and see if they match,and I think what I've taught himis to take that dataand meet with people on the ground to understand,can you actually deliver that vaccine?Can you get a woman to accept those polio dropsin her child's mouth?Because the delivery pieceis every bit as important as the science.So I think it's been more a coming to over timetowards each other's point of view,and quite frankly, the work is better because of it.CA: So, in vaccines and polio and so forth,you've had some amazing successes.What about failure, though?Can you talk about a failureand maybe what you've learned from it?BG: Yeah. Fortunately, we can afford a few failures,because we've certainly had them.We do a lot of drug work or vaccine workthat you know you're going to have different failures.Like, we put out, one that got a lot of publicitywas asking for a better condom.Well, we got hundreds of ideas.Maybe a few of those will work out.We were very naïve, certainly I was, about a drugfor a disease in India, visceral leishmaniasis,that I thought, once I got this drug,we can just go wipe out the disease.Well, turns out it took an injectionevery day for 10 days.It took three more years to get it than we expected,and then there was no wayit was going to get out there.Fortunately, we found outthat if you go kill the sand flies,you probably can have success there,but we spent five years,you could say wasted five years,and about 60 million,on a path that turned out to havevery modest benefit when we got there.CA: You're spending, like, a billion dollars a yearin education, I think, something like that.Is anything, the story of what's gone right thereis quite a long and complex one.Are there any failures that you can talk about?MG: Well, I would say a huge lesson for usout of the early work is we thoughtthat these small schools were the answer,and small schools definitely help.They bring down the dropout rate.They have less violence and crime in those schools.But the thing that we learned from that work,and what turned out to be the fundamental key,is a great teacher in front of the classroom.If you don't have an effective teacherin the front of the classroom,I don't care how big or small the building is,you're not going to change the trajectoryof whether that student will be ready for college.(Applause)CA: So Melinda, this is you andyour eldest daughter, Jenn.And just taken about three weeks ago, I think,three or four weeks ago. Where was this?MG: So we went to Tanzania.Jenn's been to Tanzania.All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit, actually.And we did something very different,which is, we decided to go spendtwo nights and three days with a family.Anna and Sanare are the parents.They invited us to come and stay in their boma.Actually, the goats had been there, I think,living in that particular little huton their little compound before we got there.And we stayed with their family,and we really, really learnedwhat life is like in rural Tanzania.And the difference between just goingand visiting for half a dayor three quarters of a dayversus staying overnight was profound,and so let me just give you one explanation of that.They had six children, and as I talked to Annain the kitchen, we cooked for about five hoursin the cooking hut that day,and as I talked to her, she had absolutely plannedand spaced with her husbandthe births of their children.It was a very loving relationship.This was a Maasai warrior and his wife,but they had decided to get married,they clearly had respect and love in the relationship.Their children, their six children,the two in the middle were twins, 13,a boy, and a girl named Grace.And when we'd go out to chop woodGrace was not a child, she was an adolescent,but she wasn't an adult.She was very, very shy.So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn.We kept trying to engage her, but she was shy.And at night, though,when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania,and there was no moon that night,the first night, and no stars,and Jenn came out of our hutwith her REI little headlamp on,Grace went immediately,and got the translator,came straight up to my Jenn and said,"When you go home,can I have your headlampso I can study at night?"CA: Oh, wow.MG: And her dad had told mehow afraid he was that unlike the son,who had passed his secondary exams,because of her chores,she'd not done so welland wasn't in the government school yet.I can't pay for private school,and she may end up on this farm like my wife."So they know the differencethat an education can makein a huge, profound way.CA: I mean, this is another picof your other two kids, Rory and Phoebe,along with Paul Farmer.Bringing up three childrenwhen you're the world's richest familyseems like a social experimentwithout much prior art.How have you managed it?What's been your approach?BG: Well, I'd say overallthe kids get a great education,but you've got to make surethey have a sense of their own abilityand what they're going to go and do,and our philosophy has beento be very clear with them --most of the money's going to the foundation --and help them find something they're excited about.We want to strike a balance where they havethe freedom to do anythingbut not a lot of money showered on themso they could go out and do nothing.And so far, they're fairly diligent,excited to pick their own direction.I'm curious why you've given me permissionto show this picture now here at TED.MG: Well, it's interesting.As they get older, they so knowthat our family belief is about responsibility,that we are in an unbelievable situationjust to live in the United Statesand have a great education,And so as they get olderand we are teaching them --they're saying,we do want people to know that we believein what you're doing, Mom and Dad,and it is okay to show us more.So we have their permission to show this picture,and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put iteventually in some of his work.But they really care deeplyabout the mission of the foundation, too.CA: You've easily got enough moneydespite your vast contributions to the foundationto make them all billionaires.Is that your plan for them?BG: Nope. No. They won't have anything like that.They need to have a sensethat their own work is meaningful and important.where Warren Buffett talked about that,and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favoreither to society or to the kids.CA: Well, speaking of Warren Buffett,something really amazing happened in 2006,when somehow your only real rivalfor richest person in Americasuddenly turned around and agreed to give80 percent of his fortuneto your foundation.How on Earth did that happen?We've got time for the short version.BG: All right. Well, Warren was a close friend,and he was going to have his wife Suziegive it all away.Tragically, she passed away before he did,and he's big on delegation, and— (Laughter) —he said —CA: Tweet that.and is willing to do it at no charge,maybe that's okay. But we were stunned.and it has been unbelievable.It's allowed us to increase our ambitionin what the foundation can do quite dramatically.Half the resources we havecome from Warren's mind-blowing generosity.CA: And I think you've pledged thatby the time you're done,more than, or 95 percent of your wealth,will be given to the foundation.BG: Yes.CA: And since this relationship, it's amazing—(Applause)And recently, you and Warrenhave been going around trying to persuadeother billionaires and successful peopleto pledge to give, what,more than half of their assets for philanthropy.How is that going?BG: Well, we've got about 120 peoplewho have now taken this giving pledge.The thing that's great is that we get togetheryearly and talk about, okay,do you hire staff, what do you give to them?We're not trying to homogenize it.I mean, the beauty of philanthropyis this mind-blowing diversity.People give to some things.We look and go, "Wow."But that's great.That's the role of philanthropyis to pick different approaches,including even in one space, like education.We need more experimentation.But it's been wonderful, meeting those people,sharing their journey to philanthropy,how they involve their kids,where they're doing it differently,and it's been way more successful than we expected.Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in sizein the years ahead.MG: And having people see that other peopleare making change with philanthropy,I mean, these are people who havecreated their own businesses,put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas.If they put their ideas and their brainbehind philanthropy, they can change the world.And they start to see others doing it, and saying,"Wow, I want to do that with my own money."To me, that's the piece that's incredible.CA: It seems to me, it's actually really hardfor some people to figure outeven how to remotely spend that much moneyon something else.There are probably some billionaires in the roomand certainly some successful people.I'm curious, can you make the pitch?What's the pitch?BG: Well, it's the most fulfilling thingwe've ever done,and you can't take it with you,and if it's not good for your kids,let's get together and brainstormabout what we can be done.The world is a far better placebecause of the philanthropists of the past,and the U.S. tradition here, which is the strongest,is the envy of the world.And part of the reason I'm so optimisticis because I do think philanthropyis going to growand take some of these thingsand shine some light in the right direction.CA: The world's got this terrible inequality,growing inequality problemthat seems structural.It does seem to me that if more of your peerstook the approach that you two have made,it would make a dentboth in that problem and certainlyin the perception of that problem.Is that a fair comment?BG: Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthyand give to the least wealthy, it's good.It tries to balance out, and that's just.MG: But you change systems.so it's just for everybodyand it works for all students.That, to me, really changesthe inequality balance.BG: That's the most important.(Applause)CA: Well, I really think that most people hereand many millions around the worldare just in awe of the trajectoryyour lives have takenand the spectacular degree to whichyou have shaped the future.Thank you so much for coming to TEDand for sharing with us and for all you do.(Applause)BG: All right, good job. (Applause)

Charlie Rose: So Larry sent me an emailand he basically said,a couple of middle-aged boring men.I said, I'm flattered by that --(Laughter) —because I'm a bit older,and he has a bit more net worth than I do.Larry Page: Well, thank you.CR: So we'll have a conversation aboutthe Internet, and we'll have a conversation Google,and we'll have a conversation about searchand privacy,and also about your philosophyand a sense of how you've connected the dotsand how this journey that begansome time agohas such interesting prospects.Mainly we want to talk about the future.So my first question: Where is Googleand where is it going?LP: Well, this is something we think about a lot,and our mission we defined a long time agois to organize the world's informationand make it universally accessible and useful.And people always say,is that really what you guys are still doing?And I always kind of think about that myself,and I'm not quite sure.But actually, when I think about search,it's such a deep thing for all of us,to really understand what you want,to understand the world's information,and we're still very much in the early stages of that,which is totally crazy.We've been at it for 15 years already,but it's not at all done.CR: When it's done, how will it be?LP: Well, I guess,in thinking about where we're going --you know, why is it not done? --a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess.it doesn't know what you're doing,it doesn't know what you know,and a lot we've been trying to do recentlyis just make your devices work,make them understand your context.Google Now, you know, knows where you are,knows what you may need.and understand that information,we really haven't done that yet.It's still very, very clunky.CR: Tell me, when you look at what Google is doing,where does Deep Mind fit?LP: Yeah, so Deep Mind is a companywe just acquired recently.It's in the U.K.First, let me tell you the way we got there,which was looking at searchand really understanding,trying to understand everything,and also make the computers not clunkyand really understand you --like, voice was really important.It's not very good.It doesn't really understand you.So we started doing machine learning researchto improve that.That helped a lot.And we started just looking at things like YouTube.Can we understand YouTube?But we actually ran machine learning on YouTubeand it discovered cats, just by itself.Now, that's an important concept.And we realized there's really something here.If we can learn what cats are,that must be really important.So I think Deep Mind,what's really amazing about Deep Mindis that it can actually --they're learning things in this unsupervised way.They started with video games,and really just, maybe I can show the video,just playing video games,and learning how to do that automatically.CR: Take a look at the video gamesand how machines are coming to be ableto do some remarkable things.LP: The amazing thing about thisis this is, I mean, obviously,these are old games,but the system just sees what you see, the pixels,and it has the controls and it has the score,and it's learned to play all of these games,same program.It's learned to play all of these gameswith superhuman performance.We've not been able to do things like thiswith computers before.And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly.This is boxing, and it figures out it cansort of pin the opponent down.The computer's on the left,and it's just racking up points.So imagine if this kindof intelligence were thrown at your schedule,or your information needs, or things like that.We're really just at the beginning of that,and that's what I'm really excited about.CR: When you look at all that's taken placewith Deep Mind and the boxing,also a part of where we're goingis artificial intelligence.Where are we, when you look at that?LP: Well, I think for me,this is kind of one of the most exciting thingsI've seen in a long time.The guy who started this company, Demis,He went back to schoolto get his Ph.D. to study the brain.And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting workgoing on that sort of crosses computer scienceand neurosciencein terms of really understandingwhat it takes to make something smartand do really interesting things.CR: But where's the level of it now?And how fast do you think we are moving?LP: Well, this is the state of the art right now,understanding cats on YouTubeand things like that,improving voice recognition.We used a lot of machine learningto improve things incrementally,but I think for me, this example's really exciting,because it's one programthat can do a lot of different things.CR: I don't know if we can do this,but we've got the image of the cat.It would be wonderful to see this.This is how machines looked at catsand what they came up with.Can we see that image?Designed by machines, seen by machines.LP: That's right.So this is learned from just watching YouTube.And there's no training,no notion of a cat,but this concept of a catis something important that you would understand,and now that the machines can kind of understand.Maybe just finishingalso on the search part,it started with search, really understandingpeople's context and their information.I did have a videoI wanted to show quickly on thatthat we actually found.(Video) ["Soy, Kenya"]Zack Matere: Not long ago,I planted a crop of potatoes.So, I went and I did a search.["Zack Matere, Farmer"]Potato diseases.One of the websites told methat ants could be the problem.It said, sprinkle wood ash over the plants.Then after a few days the ants disappeared.I got excited about the Internet.I have this friendwho really would like to expand his business.So I went with him to the cyber cafeand we checked out several sites.When I met him next, he was going to put a windmillat the local school.I felt proud becausesomething that wasn't there beforewas suddenly there.I realized that not everybodycan be able to accesswhat I was able to access.I thought that I need to have an Internetthat my grandmother can use.So I thought about a notice board.A simple wooden notice board.When I get information on my phone,I'm able to post the informationon the notice board.So it's basically like a computer.I use the Internet to help people.I think I am searching fora better lifefor me and my neighbors.So many people have access to information,but there's no follow-up to that.I think the follow-up to that is our knowledge.When people have the knowledge,they can find solutionswithout having to helped out.Information is powerful,but it is how we use it that will define us.(Applause)LP: Now, the amazing thing about that video,actually, was we just read about it in the news,and we found this gentlemen,and made that little clip.CR: When I talk to people about you,they say to me, people who know you well, say,Larry wants to change the world,and he believes technology can show the way.And that means access to the Internet.It has to do with languages.It also means how people can get accessand do things that will affect their community,and this is an example.LP: Yeah, that's right, and I think for me,I have been focusing on access more,if we're talking about the future.We recently released this Loon Projectwhich is using balloons to do it.It sounds totally crazy.We can show the video here.Actually, two out of three people in the worlddon't have good Internet access now.We actually think this can really help peoplesort of cost-efficiently.CR: And why does this balloon give you accessto the Internet?Because there was some interesting thingsyou had to do to figure out howto make balloons possible,they didn't have to be tethered.LP: Yeah, and this is a good example of innovation.Like, we've been thinking about this ideafor five years or morebefore we started working on it,but it was just really,how do we get access points up high, cheaply?You normally have to use satellitesand it takes a long time to launch them.But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloonand get it up,and actually again, it's the power of the Internet,I did a search on it,and I found, 30, 40 years ago,someone had put up a balloonand it had gone around the Earth multiple times.And I thought, why can't we do that today?And that's how this project got going.CR: But are you at the mercy of the wind?LP: Yeah, but it turns out,we did some weather simulationswhich probably hadn't really been done before,and if you control the altitude of the balloons,which you can do by pumping air into themand other ways,you can actually control roughly where they go,and so I think we can build a worldwide meshof these balloons that can cover the whole planet.CR: Before I talk about the future and transportation,where you've been a nerd for a while,and this fascination you have with transportationand automated cars and bicycles,let me talk a bit about what's been the subject hereearlier with Edward Snowden.It is security and privacy.You have to have been thinking about that.LP: Yeah, absolutely.Some of you may have seen it.But I think, for me, I guess,privacy and security are a really important thing.We think about it in terms of both things,and I think you can't have privacy without security,so let me just talk about security first,because you asked about Snowden and all of that,and then I'll say a little bit about privacy.I think for me, it's tremendously disappointingthat the governmentsecretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us.I don't think we can have a democracyif we're having to protect you and our usersfrom the governmentfor stuff that we've never had a conversation about.And I don't mean we have to knowwhat the particular terrorist attack is they're worriedabout protecting us from,but we do need to knowwhat the parameters of it is,what kind of surveillance the government'sgoing to do and how and why,and I think we haven't had that conversation.So I think the government's actually doneitself a tremendous disserviceby doing all that in secret.CR: Never coming to Googleto ask for anything.LP: Not Google, but the public.or we can't have a functioning democracy.It's just not possible.So I'm sad that Google'sin the position of protecting you and our usersfrom the governmentdoing secret thing that nobody knows about.It doesn't make any sense.CR: Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it.LP: Yes. The privacy side,I think it's -- the world is changing.You carry a phone. It knows where you are.There's so much more information about you,and that's an important thing,and it makes sense why people are askingdifficult questions.We spend a lot of time thinking about thisand what the issues are.I'm a little bit --I think the main thing that we need to dois just provide people choice,show them what data's being collected --search history, location data.We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome,and doing that in more ways,just giving people more choiceand more awareness of what's going on.I also think it's very easy.What I'm worried is that we throw outthe baby with the bathwater.And I look at, on your show, actually,I kind of lost my voice,and I haven't gotten it back.I'm hoping that by talking to youI'm going to get it back.CR: If I could do anything, I would do that.LP: All right. So get out your voodoo dolland whatever you need to do.But I think, you know what, I look at that,I made that public,and I got all this information.We got a survey done on medical conditionswith people who have similar issues,and I look at medical records, and I say,wouldn't it be amazingif everyone's medical records were availableanonymouslyto research doctors?And when someone accesses your medical record,a research doctor,they could see, you could see which doctoraccessed it and why,and you could maybe learn aboutwhat conditions you have.I think if we just did that,we'd save 100,000 lives this year.CR: Absolutely. Let me go — (Applause)LP: So I guess I'm just very worried thatwith Internet privacy,is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater,and we're not really thinkingabout the tremendous good that can comefrom people sharing informationwith the right people in the right ways.CR: And the necessary conditionthat people have to have confidencethat their information will not be abused.LP: Yeah, and I had this problem with my voice stuff.I was scared to share it.Sergey encouraged me to do that,and it was a great thing to do.CR: And the response has been overwhelming.LP: Yeah, and people are super positive.We got thousands and thousands of peoplewith similar conditions,which there's no data on today.So it was a really good thing.CR: So talking about the future, what is it about youand transportation systems?LP: Yeah. I guess I was just frustratedwith this when I was at college in Michigan.I had to get on the bus and take itand wait for it.And it was cold and snowing.I did some research on how much it cost,CR: And that began the idea of an automated car.LP: Yeah, about 18 years ago I learned aboutpeople working on automated cars,and I became fascinated by that,but I'm super excited about the possibilities of thatimproving the world.There's 20 million people or more injured per year.It's the leading cause of deathfor people under 34 in the U.S.CR: So you're talking about saving lives.LP: Yeah, and also saving spaceand making life better.Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads,half of the area,and most cities are not far behind, actually.It's just crazythat that's what we use our space for.CR: And how soon will we be there?LP: I think we can be there very, very soon.We've driven well over 100,000 milesnow totally automated.I'm super excited about getting that out quickly.You also have this idea for bicycles.LP: Well at Google, we got this ideathat we should just provide free bikes to everyone,and that's been amazing, most of the trips.You see bikes going everywhere,and the bikes wear out.They're getting used 24 hours a day.CR: But you want to put them above the street, too.LP: Well I said, how do we get peopleusing bikes more?CR: We may have a video here.LP: Yeah, let's show the video.I just got excited about this.(Music)So this is actually how you might separatebikes from cars with minimal cost.Anyway, it looks totally crazy,but I was actually thinking about our campus,working with the Zippies and stuff,and just trying to get a lot more bike usage,and I was thinking about,how do you cost-effectively separatethe bikes from traffic?And I went and searched,and this is what I found.And we're not actually working on this,that particular thing,but it gets your imagination going.CR: Let me close with this.You have this idea of [Google X].You don't simply wantto go in some small, measurable arena of progress.LP: Yeah, I thinkwhere they're really --I almost use the economic concept of additionality,which means that you're doing somethingAnd I think the more you can do things like that,the bigger impact you have,and that's about doing thingsthat people might not think are possible.And I've been amazed,the more I learn about technology,the more I realize I don't know,and that's because this technological horizon,the thing that you can see to do next,the more you learn about technology,the more you learn what's possible.You learn that the balloons are possibleis that, we have lots of peoplewho are thinking about the future,but we never see the implementation.I think of somebody you knewand read about, Tesla.The principle of that for you is what?LP: Well, I think invention is not enough.If you invent something,Tesla invented electric power that we use,but he struggled to get it out to people.That had to be done by other people.It took a long time.And I think if we can actually combine both things,where we have an innovation and invention focus,plus the ability to really -- a companythat can really commercialize thingsand get them to peoplein a way that's positive for the worldand to give people hope.You know, I'm amazed with the Loon Projectjust how excited people were about that,because it gave them hopefor the two thirds of the worldthat doesn't have Internet right now that's any good.CR: Which is a second thing about corporations.You are one of those people who believethat corporations are an agent of changeif they are run well.LP: Yeah. I'm really dismayedmost people think companies are basically evil.They get a bad rap.And I think that's somewhat correct.Companies are doing the same incremental thingthat they did 50 years agoor 20 years ago.That's not really what we need.We need, especially in technology,we need revolutionary change,not incremental change.CR: You once said, actually,as I think I've got this about right,that you might consider,rather than giving your money,if you were leaving it to some cause,just simply giving it to Elon Musk,because you had confidencethat he would change the future,and that you would therefore —LP: Yeah, if you want to go Mars,he wants to go to Mars,to back up humanity,that's a worthy goal, but it's a company,and it's philanthropical.So I think we aim to do kind of similar things.And I think, you ask, we have a lot of employeesat Google who have become pretty wealthy.People make a lot of money in technology.A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy.You want to make it better.Why isn't the company that you work forworthy not just of your timebut your money as well?I mean, but we don't have a concept of that.That's not how we think about companies,and I think it's sad,because companies are most of our effort.They're where most of people's time is,where a lot of the money is,and so I think I'd like for us to help outmore than we are.CR: When I close conversations with lots of people,I always ask this question:What state of mind,what quality of mind is itthat has served you best?People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity,and other people in the media have said that.Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus.What quality of mind,as I leave this audience,has enabled you to think about the futureand at the same timechange the present?LP: You know, I think the most important thing --I looked at lots of companiesand why I thought they don't succeed over time.We've had a more rapid turnover of companies.And I said, what did they fundamentally do wrong?What did those companies all do wrong?And usually it's just that they missed the future.And so I think, for me,I just try to focus on that and say,what is that future really going to beand how do we create it,and how do we cause our organization,to really focus on thatand drive that at a really high rate?And so that's been curiosity,it's been looking at thingspeople might not think about,working on things that no one else is working on,because that's where the additionality really is,and be willing to do that,to take that risk.Look at Android.I felt guilty about working on Androidwhen it was starting.It was a little startup we bought.It wasn't really what we were really working on.And I felt guilty about spending time on that.That was stupid.That was the future, right?That was a good thing to be working on.CR: It is great to see you here.It's great to hear from you,and a pleasure to sit at this table with you.Thanks, Larry.LP: Thank you.(Applause)CR: Larry Page.



charmian_gooch_my_wish_to_launch_a_new_era_of_openness_in_business
739262

I've come here todayto talk to you about a problem.It's a very simple yet devastating problem,one that spans the globeand is affecting all of us.The problem isanonymous companies.It sounds like a really dry and technical thing,doesn't it?But anonymous companies are making it difficultand sometimes impossibleto find outthe actual human beings responsiblesometimes for really terrible crimes.So, why am I here talking to all of you?Well, I guess I am a lifelong troublemakerand when my parents taught my twin brother and Ito question authority,I don't think they knew where it might lead.(Laughter)And, they probably really regretted itduring my stroppy teenage years when, predictably,I questioned their authority a lot.And a lot of my school teachersdidn't appreciate it much either.You see, since the age of about fiveI've always asked the question, but why?But why does the Earth go around the sun?But why is blood red?But why do I have to go to school?But why do I have to respect the teachersand authority?And little did I realizethat this question would become the basisof everything I would do.And so it wasin my twenties, a long time ago,that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North LondonI was sitting with Simon Taylorand Patrick Alleyand we were busy stuffing envelopesfor a mail out in the office of the campaign groupwhere we worked at the time.And in particular, we were talking aboutthe civil war in Cambodia.But then suddenly we stoppedand looked at each otherand said, but why don't we try and change this?And from that slightly crazy question,over two decadesand many campaigns later,including alerting the worldto the problem of blood diamonds funding war,from that crazy question,Global Witness is now an 80-strong teamAnd we're all driven by the same belief,that change really is possible.So, what exactly does Global Witness do?We investigate, we report,to uncover the people really responsiblefor funding conflict --for stealing millions from citizens around the world,also known as state looting,and for destroying the environment.rich in natural resourceslike oil or diamonds or timberare home to some of the poorestand most dispossessed people on the planet.And much of this injusticeis made possibleby currently accepted business practices.And one of these is anonymous companies.Now we've come up against anonymous companiesin lots of our investigations,like in the Democratic Republic of Congo,where we exposed how secretive dealsinvolving anonymous companieshad deprived the citizensof one of the poorest countries on the planetof well over a billion dollars.Or in Liberia,where an international predatory logging companyused front companies as it attempted to graba really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests.Or political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia,Well, that uses anonymous companies too.We secretly filmed some of the familyof the former chief minister and a lawyeras they told our undercover investigatorexactly how these dubious deals are doneusing such companies.And the awful thing is,there are so many other examples out therefrom all walks of life.This truly is a scandal of epic proportionshidden in plain sight.Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel,the Zetas,while their drugs-related violenceis tearing communities apart across the Americas.Or the anonymous company,which bought up Americans' tax debts,piled on the legal feesand then gave homeowners a choice:Pay up or lose your home.Imagine being threatened with losing your homesometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars,and not being able to find outwho you were really up against.Now anonymous companiesare great for sanctions busting too.As the Iranian government found outwhen, through a series of front companies,it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan,on Fifth Avenue,despite American sanctions.And Juicy Couture, home of of the velvet track suit,and other companies were the unwitting,unknowing tenants there.There are just so many examples,the horesemeat scandal in Europe,the Italian mafia, they've used these companiesfor decades.The $100 million American Medicare fraud,the supply of weapons to wars around the worldincluding thosein Eastern Europe in the early '90s.Anonymous companieshave even come to lightin the recent revolution in the Ukraine.But, for every case that we and others exposethere are so many more that will remain hidden awaybecause of the current system.And it's just a simple truthfor stealing from you and meand millions of others,they are remaining facelessand they are escaping accountabilityand they're doing this with ease,and they're doing it using legal structures.And really, that is unfair.Well, you might well ask,what exactly is an anonymous company,and can I really set one up, and use it,without anyone knowing who I am?Well, the answer is, yes you can.But if you're anything like me,you'll want to see some of that for yourself,so let me show you.Well first you need to work outwhere you want to set it up.Now, at this point you might be imaginingone of those lovely tropical island tax havensbut here's the thing,shockingly,my own hometown, London,and indeed the U.K.,is one of the best places in the worldto set up an anonymous company.And the other, even better,I'm afraid that's America.Do you know, in some states across Americayou need less identificationto open up a companythan you do to get a library card,like Delaware,which is one of the easiest placesin the world to set up an anonymous company.Okay, so let's say it's America,and let's say it's Delaware,and now you can simply go onlineand find yourself a company service provider.So, here's one,but there are plenty of others to choose from.And having made your choice,you then pick what type of company you wantand then fill in a contact, name and address.But don't worry,it doesn't have to be your name.It can be your lawyer'sor your service provider's,and it's not for the public record anyway.And then you add the owner of the company.Now this is the key part,and again it doesn't have to be you,because you can get creative,to choose from.And nominees are the people that youcan legally pay to be your company's owner.And if you don't want to involve anyone else,it doesn't even have to be an actual human being.It could be another company.And then finally,give your company a nameadd a few more details and make your payment.And then the service providerwill take a few hours or more to process it.But there you are,in 10 minutes of online shoppingyou can create yourself an anonymous company.And not only is it easy,really, really easy and cheap,it's totally legal too.But the fun doesn't have to end there,maybe you want to be even more anonymous.Well, that's no problem either.You can simply keep adding layers,companies owned by companies.You can have hundreds of layerswith hundreds of companies spread acrosslots of different countries,like a giant web,each layer adds anonymity.Each layer makes it more difficultfor law enforcement and othersto find out who the real owner is.But whose interests is this all serving?It might be in the interests of the companyor a particular individual,but what about all of us, the public?There hasn't even been a global conversation yetabout whether it's okayto misuse companies in this way.And what does it all mean for us?Well, an example that really haunts meis one I came across recently.And it's that of a horrific firein a nightclub in Buenos Airesabout a decade ago.It was the night before New Year's Eve.Three thousand very happy revelers,many of them teenagers,were crammed into a space meant for 1,000.And then tragedy struck,a fire broke outplastic decorations were melting from the ceilingand toxic smoke filled the club.So people tried to escapeonly to find that some of the fire doorshad been chained shut.Over 200 people died.Seven hundred were injured trying to get out.reeled in shock,investigators tried to find out who was responsible.And as they looked for the owners of the club,they found instead anonymous companies,and confusion surrounded the identities of thoseinvolved with the companies.Now ultimately, a range of people were chargedand some went to jail.But this was an awful tragedy,and it shouldn't have been so difficultjust to try and find out who was responsiblefor those deaths.Because in an agewhen there is so much informationout there in the open,why should this crucial informationabout company ownershipstay hidden away?arms traders and more,be able to hide their identities from us, the public?Anonymous companiesmight be the norm right nowbut it wasn't always this way.Companies were createdto give people a chance to innovateand not have to put everything on the line.Companies were created to limit financial risk,Companies were never intended to be anonymous,and they don't have to be.And so I come to my wish.My wish is for us to knowwho owns and controls companiesso that they can no longer be used anonymouslyagainst the public good.Together let's ignite world opinion,change the law,and launch a new era of openness in business.So what might this look like?Well, imagine if you could go onlineand look up the real owner of a company.Imagine if this data were open and free,accessible across bordersfor citizens and businessesand law enforcement alike.Imagine what a game changer that would be.So how are we going to do this?Well, there is only one way.Together, we have to change the law globallyto create public registrieswhich list the true owners of companiesand can be accessed by allwith no loopholes.And yes, this is ambitious,but there is momentum on this issue,and over the years I have seenthe sheer power of momentum,and it's just starting on this issue.There is such an opportunity right now.And the TED communityof creative and innovative thinkers and doersacross all of societycould make the crucial difference.You really can make this change happen.Now, a simple starting pointis the address behind mefor a Facebook page that you can join nowto support the campaign and spread the word.It's going to be a springboardfor our global campaigning.And the techies among you,you could really help us create a prototypepublic registryto demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.Campaign groups from around the worldhave come together to work on this issue.The U.K. government is already on board;it supports these public registries.And just last week,the European Parliament came on boardwith a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries.That is momentum.(Applause)But it's early days.America still needs to come on board,as do so many other countries.And to succeed we will all togetherneed to help and push our politicians,because without that,real far-reaching, world-shifting changejust isn't going to happen.Because this isn't just about changing the law,this is about starting a conversationabout what it's okay for companies to do,This isn't just a dry policy issue.This is a human issuewhich affects us all.This is about being on the right side of history.we need you.Together, let's kickstart this global movement.Let's just do it,let's end anonymous companies.Thank you.(Applause)

The 2011 Arab Springcaptured the attention of the world.It also captured the attentionof authoritarian governments in other countries,who were worried that revolution would spread.To respond, they ramped up surveillanceof activists, journalists and dissidentswho they feared would inspire revolutionin their own countries.One prominent Bahraini activist,who was arrested and tortured by his government,has said that the interrogators showed himtranscripts of his telephone callsand text messages.Of course, it's no secretIt's for that reason that many activistsspecifically avoid using the telephone.Instead, they use tools like Skype,which they think are immune to interception.They're wrong.There have now been over the last few yearsan industry of companieswho provide surveillance technology to governments,to hack into the computersof surveillance targets.instead they now hack into your computer,enable your webcam, enable your microphone,and steal documents from your computer.When the government of Egypt fell in 2011,activists raided the office of the secret police,and among the many documents they foundwas this document by the Gamma Corporation,by Gamma International.Gamma is a German companythat manufactures surveillance softwareand sells it only to governments.It's important to note that most governmentsdon't really have the in-house capabilitiesto develop this software.Smaller ones don't have the resourcesor the expertise,and so there's this market of Western companieswho are happy to supply them with the toolsand techniques for a price.Gamma is just one of these companies.I should note also that Gamma never actually soldtheir software to the Egyptian government.They'd sent them an invoice for a sale,but the Egyptians never bought it.Instead, apparently, the Egyptian governmentused a free demo version of Gamma's software.(Laughter)So this screenshot is from a sales videothat Gamma produced.Really, they're just emphasizingin a relatively slick presentationthe fact that the police can sort of sitin an air-conditioned officeand remotely monitor someonewithout them having any idea that it's going on.You know, your webcam light won't turn on.His name is Martin Muench.There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist.This is perhaps my favorite.I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam.You can see there's a little stickerthat's placed over his camera.He knows what kind of surveillance is possible,and so clearly he doesn't want it to be usedagainst him.Muench has said that he intendsfor his software to be usedto capture terrorists and locate pedophiles.Of course, he's also acknowledged that oncethe software has been sold to governments,he has no way of knowing how it can be used.Gamma's software has been located on serversin countries around the world,many with really atrocious track recordsand human rights violations.Gamma is not the only company in the business.As I said, it's a $5 billion industry.One of the other big guys in the industryis an Italian company called Hacking Team.Now, Hacking Team has what is probablythe slickest presentation.The video they've produced is very sexy,and so I'm going to play you a clipjust so you can get a feelboth for the capabilities of the softwarebut also how it's marketedto their government clients.(Music)You have to hack your target.["While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders"]You have to hit many different platforms.You have to overcome encryptionand capture relevant data.web browsing, audio &amp; video"]Being stealth and untraceable.Deployed all over your country.Exactly what we do.but, in fact, Hacking Team's softwareis being sold to governments around the world.Last year we learned, for example,Many, many countries it's been found in.So, Hacking Team has also been actively courtingthe U.S. law enforcement market.In the last year or so, the companyhas opened a sales office in Maryland.The company has also hired a spokesperson.They've been attendingsurveillance industry conferenceswhere law enforcement officials show up.They've spoken at the conferences.What I thought was most fascinating wasthey've actually paid for the coffee breakat one of the law enforcement conferencesearlier this year.I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Teamhas sold their technology in the United States,but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it,it isn't because they haven't been trying hard.So as I said before,governments that don't really have the resourcesto build their own tools will buyoff-the-shelf surveillance software,and so for that reason,you see that the government of, say, Tunisia,They're all buying off-the-shelf stuff.and so for several years, I've been tryingto figure out if and how the FBIis hacking into the computers of surveillance targets.they're a civil society group —obtained hundreds of documents from the FBIMost of these documents were heavily redacted,but what you can see from the slides,if I zoom in, is this term:Remote Operations Unit.Now, when I first looked into this,I'd never heard of this unit before.I'd never heard of it.And so I went online and I did some research,and ultimately I hit the mother lodewhen I went to LinkedIn,the social networking site for job seekers.who had at one point workedfor the Remote Operating Unit,and were describing in surprising detail on their CVswhat they had done in their former job.(Laughter)So I took this informationand she was able to contact several otherformer law enforcement officialswho spoke on background and confirmedthat yes, in fact, the FBI has a dedicated teamthat does nothing but hack into the computersof surveillance targets.Like Gamma and Hacking Team,the FBI also has the capabilityto remotely activate webcams, microphones,steal documents, get web browsing information,the works.There's sort of a big problemwith governments going into hacking,and that's that terrorists, pedophiles,drug dealers, journalists and human rights activistsall use the same kinds of computers.There's no drug dealer phoneand there's no journalist laptop.We all use the same technology,and what that means then is that for governmentsto have the capability to hack into the computersof the real bad guys,they also have to have the capabilityto hack into our devices too.So governments around the worldhave been embracing this technology.They've been embracing hackingas a law enforcement technique,but without any real debate.In the United States, where I live,there have been no congressional hearings.There's no law that's been passedspecifically authorizing this technique,and because of its power and potential for abuse,it's vital that we have an informed public debate.Thank you very much.(Applause)



philip_evans_how_data_will_transform_business

I'm going to talk a little bit about strategyand its relationship with technology.We tend to think of business strategyas being a rather abstract bodyof essentially economic thought,perhaps rather timeless.I'm going to argue that, in fact,business strategy has always been premisedon assumptions about technology,that those assumptions are changing,and, in fact, changing quite dramatically,and that therefore what that will drive us tois a different concept of what we meanby business strategy.Let me start, if I may,with a little bit of history.The idea of strategy in businessowes its origins to two intellectual giants:Bruce Henderson, the founder of BCG,Henderson's central idea was what you might callthe Napoleonic idea of concentrating massagainst weakness, of overwhelming the enemy.What Henderson recognized was that,in the business world,there are many phenomena which are characterizedby what economists would call increasing returns --scale, experience.The more you do of something,disproportionately the better you get.And therefore he found a logic for investingin such kinds of overwhelming massin order to achieve competitive advantage.And that was the first introductionof essentially a military concept of strategyinto the business world.Porter agreed with that premise,but he qualified it.He pointed out, correctly, that that's all very well,but businesses actually have multiple steps to them.They have different components,and each of those components might be drivenby a different kind of strategy.in some activities but disadvantaged in others.He formed the concept of the value chain,essentially the sequence of steps with whicha, shall we say, raw material, becomes a component,becomes assembled into a finished product,and then is distributed, for example,and he argued that advantage accruedto each of those components,and that the advantage of the wholewas in some sense the sum or the averageof that of its parts.And this idea of the value chain was predicatedon the recognition thatwhat holds a business together is transaction costs,that in essence you need to coordinate,organizations are more efficient at coordinationthan markets, very often,and therefore the nature and role and boundariesof the cooperation are defined by transaction costs.It was on those two ideas,Henderson's idea of increasing returnsto scale and experience,and Porter's idea of the value chain,encompassing heterogenous elements,that the whole edifice of business strategywas subsequently erected.Now what I'm going to argue isthat those premises are, in fact, being invalidated.First of all, let's think about transaction costs.as they have evolved over a long period of time.As we all know from so many contexts,they have been radically transformedsince the days when Porter and Hendersonfirst formulated their theories.In particular, since the mid-'90s,communications costs have actually been fallingeven faster than transaction costs,which is why communication, the Internet,has exploded in such a dramatic fashion.Now, those falling transaction costshave profound consequences,because if transaction costs are the gluethat hold value chains together, and they are falling,there is less to economize on.and value chains at least can break up.They needn't necessarily, but they can.In particular, it then becomes possible fora competitor in one businessto use their position in one step of the value chainin order to penetrate or attackor disintermediate the competitor in another.That is not just an abstract proposition.There are many very specific storiesof how that actually happened.The encyclopedia businessin the days of leatherbound bookswas basically a distribution business.The CD-ROM and then the Internet came along,new technologies made the distribution of knowledgemany orders of magnitude cheaper,and the encyclopedia industry collapsed.It's now, of course, a very familiar story.This, in fact, more generally was the storyof the first generation of the Internet economy.It was about falling transaction costsbreaking up value chainsand therefore allowing disintermediation,or what we call deconstruction.One of the questions I was occasionally asked was,well, what's going to replace the encyclopediawhen Britannica no longer has a business model?The Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopediacreated by its users.And this, in fact, defines what you might callthe second decade of the Internet economy,the decade in which the Internet as a nounbecame the Internet as a verb.It became a set of conversations,became the dominant phenomenon.Now what that really meantin terms of the Porter-Henderson frameworkIt turned out that tens of thousandsof autonomous individuals writing an encyclopediacould do just as good a job,and certainly a much cheaper job,than professionals in a hierarchical organization.So basically what was happening was that one layerof this value chain was becoming fragmented,as individuals could take overwhere organizations were no longer needed.does anything distinguish the third?And what I'm going to argue is that indeedsomething does distinguish the third,and it maps exactly on to the kind ofAnd that is, about data.If we go back to around 2000,and it was indeed true that the world's stock of datawas growing, indeed growing quite fast.but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog.We go forward to 2007,not only had the world's stock of data exploded,but there'd been this massive substitutionof digital for analog.And more important even than that,if you look more carefully at this graph,what you will observe is that about a halfof that digital datais information that has an I.P. address.It's on a server or it's on a P.C.But having an I.P. address means that itcan be connected to any other datathat has an I.P. address.It means it becomes possibleto put together half of the world's knowledgein order to see patterns,an entirely new thing.If we run the numbers forward to today,it probably looks something like this.We're not really sure.If we run the numbers forward to 2020,we of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC.And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplicationin the stock of information that is connectedvia an I.P. address.Now, if the number of connections that we can makeis proportional to the number of pairs of data points,a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of datais a ten-thousandfold multiplicationin the number of patternsthat we can see in that data,this just in the last 10 or 11 years.This, I would submit, is a sea change,a profound change in the economicsof the world that we live in.The first human genome,that of James Watson,and it took about 200 million dollarsand about 10 years of work to mapjust one person's genomic makeup.In fact, they've come down in recent yearsvery dramatically indeed,and it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015it will be below 100 dollars --a five or six order of magnitude dropin the cost of genomic mappingin just a 15-year period,an extraordinary phenomenon.Now, in the days when mapping a genomecost millions, or even tens of thousands,it was basically a research enterprise.Scientists would gather some representative people,and they would see patterns, and they would tryfrom the abstract patterns they findfrom these particular selected individuals.99 dollars while you wait,then what happens is, it becomes retail.It becomes above all clinical.You go the doctor with a cold,and if he or she hasn't done it already,the first thing they do is map your genome,at which point what they're now doingand trying to work out how it applies to you,but they're starting from your particular genome.Now think of the power of that.Think of where that takes uswhen we can combine genomic datawith clinical datawith data about drug interactionswith the kind of ambient data that deviceslike our phone and medical sensorswill increasingly be collecting.Think what happens when we collect all of that dataand we can put it togetherin order to find patterns we wouldn't see before.This, I would suggest, perhaps it will take a while,but this will drive a revolution in medicine.Fabulous, lots of people talk about this.How is that model of colossal sharingacross all of those kinds of databasescompatible with the business modelsof institutions and organizations and corporationsthat are involved in this business today?If your business is based on proprietary data,how on Earth is that company or is that societyin fact going to achieve the valuethat's implicit in the technology? They can't.So essentially what's happening here,and genomics is merely one example of this,is that technology is drivingthe natural scaling of the activitybeyond the institutional boundaries within whichwe have been used to thinking about it,and in particular beyond the institutional boundariesin terms of which business strategyas a discipline is formulated.The basic story here is that what used to bevertically integrated, oligopolistic competitionamong essentially similar kinds of competitorsis evolving, by one means or another,from a vertical structure to a horizontal one.Why is that happening?and because scale is polarizing.The plummeting of transaction costsweakens the glue that holds value chains together,and allows them to separate.The polarization of scale economiestowards the very small -- small is beautiful --allows for scalable communitiesto substitute for conventional corporate production.The scaling in the opposite direction,towards things like big data,drive the structure of businesstowards the creation of new kinds of institutionsthat can achieve that scale.But either way, the typically vertical structuregets driven to becoming more horizontal.The logic isn't just about big data.you can tell the same story about fiber optics.If we look at the pharmaceutical industry,or, for that matter, university research,you can say exactly the same storyabout so-called "big science."And in the opposite direction,if we look, say, at the energy sector,where all the talk is about how householdswill be efficient producers of green energyand efficient conservers of energy,that is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon.That is the fragmentation of scalebecause the very small can substitutefor the traditional corporate scale.Either way, what we are driven tois this horizontalization of the structure of industries,and that implies fundamental changesin how we think about strategy.It means, for example, that we need to thinkabout strategy as the curationof these kinds of horizontal structure,where things like business definitionand even industry definitionare actually the outcomes of strategy,not something that the strategy presupposes.It means, for example, we need to work outhow to accommodate collaborationand competition simultaneously.Think about the genome.We need to accommodate the very largeand the very small simultaneously.And we need industry structuresto maybe the social motivationsof infrastructure built by governments,or, for that matter, cooperative institutionsbuilt by companies that are otherwise competing,These kinds of transformationsThey drive us into a completely new world.They require us, whether we arein the public sector or the private sector,to think very fundamentally differentlyabout the structure of business,and, at last, it makes strategy interesting again.Thank you.(Applause)

Almost two years ago,I was driving in my car in Germany,and I turned on the radio.Europe at the time was in the middleof the Euro crisis,and all the headlines were about European countriesgetting downgraded by rating agenciesin the United States.I listened and thought to myself,"What are these rating agencies,and why is everybody so upset about their work?"Well, if you were sittingnext to me in the car that dayand would have told me that I would devotethe next years to trying to reform them,obviously I would have called you crazy.But guess what's really crazy:the way these rating agencies are run.And I would like to explain to younot only why it's time to change this,but also how we can do it.So let me tell you a little bitabout what rating agencies really do.As you would read a car magazinebefore purchasing a new caror taking a look at a product reviewbefore deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get,investors are reading ratingsbefore they decide in which kind of productthey are investing their money.A rating can range from a so-called AAA,which means it's a top-performing product,and it can go down to the levelof the so-called BBB-,which means it's a fairly risky investment.Rating agencies are rating companies.They are rating banks.They are rating even financial productslike the infamous mortgage-backed securities.But they can also rate countries,and these ratings are called sovereign ratings,and I would like to focus in particularon these sovereign ratings.And I can tell, as you're listening to me right now,you're thinking,so why should I really care about this, right?Be honest.Well, ratings affect you.They affect all of us.If a rating agency rates a country,it basically assesses and evaluatesa country's debtand the ability and willingness of a countryto repay its debt.So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency,the country has to pay morein order to borrow moneyon the international markets.So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer,because you and your fellow countrymenhave to pony up more in order to borrow.But what if a country can't afford to pay morebecause it's maybe too expensive?Well, then the country has less availablefor other services, like roads, schools, healthcare.And this is the reason why you should care,because sovereign ratings affect everyone.And that is the reason why I believethey should be defined as public goods.They should be transparent, accessible,and available to everyone at no cost.But here's the situation:the rating agency market is dominatedby three players and three players only --Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch --there is really no competition.There is no incentive to improvethe quality of your product.putting the global economy on the brink,and yet they have to change the way they operate.The second point,would you really buy a carjust based on the advice of the dealer?Obviously not, right? That would be irresponsible.But that's actually what's going onin the rating agency sector every single day.The customers of these rating agencies,like countries or companies,they are paying for their own ratings,and obviously this is creatinga conflict of interest.The third point is,the rating agencies are not really telling ushow they are coming up with their ratings,but in this day and age,you can't even sell a candy barwithout listing everything that's inside.But for ratings, a crucial element of our economy,we really do not knowwhat all the different ingredients are.We are allowing the rating agenciesto be intransparent about their work,and we need to change this.I think there is no doubt that the sectorneeds a complete overhaul,not just a trimming at the margins.I think it's time for a bold move.I think it's time to upgrade the system.And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundationhave invested a lot of time and effortthinking about an alternative for the sector.And we have developed the first modelfor a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk,and we call it by its acronym, INCRA.INCRA would make a differenceto the current systemby adding another nonprofit player to the mix.It would be based on a nonprofit modelthat would be based on a sustainable endowment.The endowment would create incomethat would allow us to run the operation,to run the rating agency,and it would also allow usto make our ratings publicly available.But this is not enough to make a difference, right?INCRA would also be based ona very, very clear governance structurethat would avoid any conflict of interest,and it would include many stakeholders from society.INCRA would not only be a Europeanor an American rating agency,it would be a truly international one,in which, in particular, the emerging economiesThe second big difference that INCRA would make isthat would it base its sovereign risk assessmenton a broader set of indicators.Think about it that way.If we conduct a sovereign rating,we basically take a look atthe economic soil of a country,its macroeconomic fundamentals.But we also have to ask the question,who is cultivating the economic soilof a country, right?Well, a country has many gardeners,and one of them is the government,so we have to ask the question,how is a country governed?How is it managed?And this is the reason why we have developedwhat we call forward-looking indicators.These are indicators that give youa much better read aboutthe socioeconomic development of a country.I hope you would agree it's important for you to knowIt's important for you to knowif the government of your countryis able to manage a crisis,if the government is finally able to implementthe reforms that it's promised.For example, if INCRA would rateSouth Africa right now,of course we would take a very, very close lookat the youth unemployment of the country,the highest in the world.If over 70 percent of a country's populationunder the age of 35 is unemployed,of course this has a huge impact on the economytoday and even more so in the future.Well, our friends at Moody's,Standard &amp; Poor's, and Fitch will tell uswe would take this into account as well.But guess what? We do not knowexactly how they will take this into account.And this leads me to the third big differencethat INCRA would make.INCRA would not only release its ratingsbut it would also release its indicatorsand methodology.So in contrast to the current system,INCRA would be fully transparent.So in a nutshell,INCRA would offer an alternativeby adding a new, nonprofit player to the mixthat would increase the competition,it would increase the transparency of the sector,and it would also increase the quality.I can tell that sovereign ratingsmay still look to you like this very small pieceof this very complex global financial world,but I tell you it's a very important one,and a very important one to fix,because sovereign ratings affect all of us,and they should be addressed and should be definedas public goods.And this is why we are testing our model right now,and why we are trying to find out if it canbring together a group of able and willing actorsto bring INCRA to life.I truly believe building up INCRAis in everyone's interest,and that we have the unique opportunity right nowto turn INCRA into a cornerstoneof a new, more inclusive financial system.Because for way too long,we have left the big financial players on their own.It's time to give them some company.Thank you.(Applause)

What makes a great leader today?Many of us carry this imageof this all-knowing superherowho stands and commandsand protects his followers.But that's kind of an image from another time,and what's also outdatedare the leadership development programsthat are based on success modelsfor a world that was, not a world that isor that is coming.We conducted a study of 4,000 companies,and we asked them, let's see the effectivenessof your leadership development programs.Fifty-eight percent of the companiescited significant talent gapsfor critical leadership roles.off-sites, assessments, coaching, all of these things,more than half the companieshad failed to grow enough great leaders.You may be asking yourself,is my company helping me to prepareto be a great 21st-century leader?The odds are, probably not.Now, I've spent 25 years of my professional lifeobserving what makes great leaders.I've worked inside Fortune 500 companies,I've advised over 200 CEOs,and I've cultivated more leadership pipelinesthan you can imagine.But a few years ago, I noticed a disturbing trendin leadership preparation.I noticed that, despite all the efforts,there were familiar stories that kept resurfacingabout individuals.One story was about Chris,a high-potential, superstar leaderwho moves to a new unit and fails,destroying unrecoverable value.And then there were stories like Sidney, the CEO,who was so frustratedbecause her company is citedas a best company for leaders,but only one of the top 50 leaders is equippedto lead their crucial initiatives.And then there were storieslike the senior leadership teamof a once-thriving businessthat's surprised by a market shift,finds itself having to force the companyto reduce its size in halfor go out of business.Now, these recurring storiescause me to ask two questions.Why are the leadership gaps wideningwhen there's so much more investmentin leadership development?And what are the great leaders doingdistinctly different to thrive and grow?One of the things that I did,I was so consumed by these questionsand also frustrated by those stories,that I left my jobso that I could study this full time,and I took a year to travelto different parts of the worldto learn about effective and ineffectiveleadership practices in companies,countries and nonprofit organizations.And so I did things like travel to South Africa,where I had an opportunity to understandhow Nelson Mandela was ahead of his timein anticipating and navigatinghis political, social and economic context.I also met a number of nonprofit leaderswho, despite very limited financial resources,were making a huge impact in the world,often bringing together seeming adversaries.And I spent countless hours in presidential librariestrying to understand how the environmenthad shaped the leaders,the moves that they made,and then the impact of those movesbeyond their tenure.And then, when I returned to work full time,in this role, I joined with wonderful colleagueswho were also interested in these questions.Now, from all this, I distilledthe characteristics of leaders who are thrivingand what they do differently,and then I also distilledthe preparation practices that enable peopleto grow to their potential.I want to share some of those with you now.("What makes a great leader in the 21st century?")In a 21st-century world, which is more global,digitally enabled and transparent,and where nothing big gets donewithout some kind of a complex matrix,relying on traditional development practiceswill stunt your growth as a leader.In fact, traditional assessmentswill give you false positives,lulling you into thinking that you are more preparedthan you really are.Leadership in the 21st century is definedand evidenced by three questions.Where are you lookingto anticipate the next changeto your business model or your life?The answer to this question is on your calendar.Who are you spending time with? On what topics?Where are you traveling? What are you reading?And then how are you distilling thisinto understanding potential discontinuities,and then making a decision to do somethingright now so that you're prepared and ready?There's a leadership team that does a practicewhere they bring together each membercollecting, here are trends that impact me,here are trends that impact another team member,and they share these,or to anticipate a new move.Great leaders are not head-down.They see around corners,shaping their future, not just reacting to it.The second question is,what is the diversity measureBut to some extent, we all have a networkof people that we're comfortable with.So this question is about your capacityto develop relationships with peoplethat are very different than you.And those differences can be biological,And yet, despite all these differences,they connect with youand they trust you enoughto cooperate with youin achieving a shared goal.Great leaders understandthat having a more diverse networkis a source of pattern identificationat greater levels and also of solutions,because you have people that are thinkingdifferently than you are.Third question: are you courageous enoughThere's an expression: Go along to get along.But if you follow this advice,chances are as a leader,Great leaders dare to be different.They don't just talk about risk-taking,they actually do it.And one of the leaders shared with me the fact thatthe most impactful development comeswhen you are able to build the emotional staminato withstand people telling you that your new ideais naïve or reckless or just plain stupid.Now interestingly, the people who will join youare not your usual suspects in your network.They're often people that think differentlyand therefore are willing to join youin taking a courageous leap.And it's a leap, not a step.More than traditional leadership programs,answering these three questionswill determine your effectivenessas a 21st-century leader.So what makes a great leader in the 21st century?I've met many, and they stand out.They are women and menwho are preparing themselvesnot for the comfortable predictability of yesterdaybut also for the realities of todayand all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow.Thank you.(Applause)



chris_mcknett_the_investment_logic_for_sustainability
918405

The world is changingin some really profound ways,and I worry that investorsaren't paying enough attentionto some of the biggest drivers of change,especially when it comes to sustainability.And by sustainability, I mean the really juicy things,like environmental and social issuesand corporate governance.I think it's reckless to ignore these things,because doing so can jeopardizefuture long-term returns.And here's something that may surprise you:the balance of power to really influence sustainabilityrests with institutional investors,the large investors like pension funds,foundations and endowments.I believe that sustainable investingis less complicated than you think,better-performing than you believe,and more important than we can imagine.Let me remind you what we already know.We have a population that's both growing and aging;we have seven billion souls todayheading to 10 billionat the end of the century;we consume natural resourcesfaster than they can be replenished;and the emissions that are mainly responsiblefor climate change just keep increasing.but that's not all.They're economic issues,and that makes them relevantto risk and return.And they are really complexand they can seem really far off,that the temptation may be to do this:bury our heads in the sand and not think about it.Resist this, if you can. Don't do this at home.(Laughter)But it makes me wonderif the investment rules of todayare fit for purpose tomorrow.We know that investors,they look at financial data,metrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share,valuation -- you know, the really sexy stuff.And these things are fundamental, of course,but they're not enough.Investors should also look at performance metricsin what we call ESG:environment, social and governance.Environment includes energy consumption,water availability, waste and pollution,just making efficient uses of resources.Social includes human capital,things like employee engagementand innovation capacity,as well as supply chain managementand labor rights and human rights.And governance relates to the oversightof companies by their boards and investors.See, I told you this is the really juicy stuff.But ESG is the measure of sustainability,and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factorswith financial factors into the investment process.It means limiting future riskby minimizing harm to people and planet,and it means providing capital to userswho deploy it towards productiveand sustainable outcomes.So if sustainability matters financially today,and all signs indicate more tomorrow,is the private sector paying attention?Well, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are.They started to see sustainabilitynot just as important but crucial to business success.About 80 percent of global CEOssee sustainability as the root to growth in innovationand leading to competitive advantagein their industries.But 93 percent see ESG as the future,or as important to the future of their business.So the views of CEOs are clear.There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability.So how are companies actually leveraging ESGto drive hard business results?One example is near and dear to our hearts.In 2012, State Street migrated 54 applicationsto the cloud environment,and we retired another 85.We virtualized our operating system environments,and we completed numerous automation projects.and they reduce our real estate footprint,and they yield savings of 23 million dollarsin operating costs annually,and avoid the emissionsof a 100,000 metric tons of carbon.That's the equivalent of taking 21,000 carsoff the road.So awesome, right?Another example is Pentair.Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate,and about a decade ago,they sold their core power tools businessand reinvested those proceeds in a water business.That's a really big bet. Why did they do that?Well, with apologies to the Home Improvement fans,there's more growth in water than in power tools,and this company has their sights seton what they call "the new New World."That's four billion middle class peopledemanding food, energy and water.Now, you may be asking yourself,are these just isolated cases?I mean, come on, really?Do companies that take sustainability into accountreally do well financially?The answer that may surprise you is yes.perform just as well as others.In blue, we see the MSCI World.It's an index of large companiesfrom developed markets across the world.And in gold, we see a subset of companiesrated as having the best ESG performance.Over three plus years, no performance tradeoff.So that's okay, right? We want more. I want more.In some cases, there may be outperformancefrom ESG.In blue, we see the performanceof the 500 largest global companies,and in gold, we see a subset of companieswith best practice in climate change strategyand risk management.Now over almost eight years,they've outperformed by about two thirds.So yes, this is correlation. It's not causation.But it does illustrate that environmental leadershipis compatible with good returns.So if the returns are the same or betterand the planet benefits, wouldn't this be the norm?Are investors, particularly institutional investors,engaged?Well, some are,and a few are really at the vanguard.Hesta.Hesta is a retirement fund for healthand community services employees in Australia,with assets of 22 billion [dollars].They believe that ESG has the potentialto impact risks and returns,so incorporating it into the investment processis core to their dutyto act in the best interest of fund members,core to their duty.You gotta love the Aussies, right?CalPERS is another example.CalPERS is the pension fundfor public employees in California,and with assets of 244 billion [dollars],they are the second largest in the U.S.and the sixth largest in the world.Now, they're moving toward 100 percentsustainable investmentby systematically integrated ESGacross the entire fund.Why? They believe it's criticalto superior long-term returns, full stop.In their own words, "long-term value creationrequires the effective managementof three forms of capital:financial, human, and physical.This is why we are concerned with ESG."Now, I do speak to a lot of investorsas part of my job,and not all of them see it this way.Often I hear, "We are required to maximize returns,so we don't do that here,"or, "We don't want to use the portfolioto make policy statements."The one that just really gets under my skin is,"If you want to do something about that,just make money, give the profits to charities."It's eyes rolling, eyes rolling.I mean, let me clarify something right here.Companies and investors are notsingularly responsible for the fate of the planet.They don't have indefinite social obligations,and prudent investing and finance theoryaren't subordinate to sustainability.They're compatible.So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here.But institutional investorsare the x-factor in sustainability.Why do they hold the key?The answer, quite simply, is, they have the money.(Laughter)A lot of it.I mean, a really lot of it.The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars.The global bond market, 78 trillion.That's 133 trillion combined.That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.That's the world's largest economy.That's some serious freaking firepower.So we can reconsidersome of these pressing challenges,like fresh water, clean air,feeding 10 billion mouths,if institutional investorsintegrated ESG into investment.What if they used that firepowerto allocate more of their capitalto companies working the hardestat solving these challengesor at least not exacerbating them?What if we work and save and invest,only to find that the world we retire intois more stressed and less secure than it is now?What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?Now a fair question might be,what if all this sustainability risk stuffis exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent,something for virtuous consumersor lifestyle choice?Well, President John F. Kennedy said somethingabout this that is just spot on:"There are risks and costs to a program of action,but they are far less than the long-range risksand costs of comfortable inaction."I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this,the odds that it's not completely wrongare better than the oddsthat our house will burn downor we'll get in a car accident.Well, maybe not if you live in Boston. (Laughter)But my point is that we buy insuranceto protect ourselves financiallyin case those things happen, right?So by investing sustainablywe're doing two things.We're creating insurance,reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy,and at the same time, in the short term,we're not sacrificing performance.Good, you like it. I like it too.(Laughter)I like it because it pokes funat both sides of the climate change issue.I bet you can't guess which side I'm on.But what I really like about itis that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said,which is, "Plan for the future,because that's where you're going to spendthe rest of your life."Thank you.(Applause)

I have spent the last yearstrying to resolve two enigmas:Why is productivity so disappointingin all the companies where I work?I have worked with more than 500 companies.Despite all the technological advances --computers, I.T., communications, telecommunications,the Internet.Enigma number two:Why is there so little engagement at work?Why do people feel so miserable,even actively disengaged?Disengaging their colleagues.Acting against the interest of their company.Despite all the affiliation events,the celebration, the people initiatives,the leadership development programs to trainmanagers on how to better motivate their teams.At the beginning, I thought there wasa chicken and egg issue:Or vice versa, because they are less productive,we put more pressure and they are less engaged.But as we were doing our analysiswe realized that there was a common root causeto these two issuesThe way we organize is based on two pillars.The hard -- structure, processes, systems.The soft --And whenever a companyreorganizes, restructures, reengineers,goes through a cultural transformation program,it chooses these two pillars.Now, we try to refine them,we try to combine them.The real issue is --and this is the answer to the two enigmas --these pillars are obsolete.Everything you read in business books is basedeither on one or the otheror their combination.They are obsolete.How do they workwhen you try to use these approachesin front of the new complexity of business?committees, headquarters, hubs, clusters,you name it.What happens basically on the left,We need quality, cost, reliability, speed.And every time there is a new requirement,we use the same approach.We create dedicated structure processed systems,The hard approach creates just complicatednessin the organization.Let's take an example.An automotive company, the engineering divisionis a five-dimensional matrix.If you open any cell of the matrix,you find another 20-dimensional matrix.You have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption,Mr. Anti-Collision Properties.For any new requirement,you have a dedicated functionin charge of aligning engineers againstthe new requirement.Some years ago, a new requirementappeared on the marketplace:the length of the warranty period.So therefore the new requirement is repairability,making cars easy to repair.if you have to remove the engineto access the lights,the car will have to stay one week in the garageSo, what was the solution using the hard approach?If repairability is the new requirement,the solution is to create a new function,Mr. Repairability.and eventually repairability incentive.That came on top of 25 other KPIs.What percentage of these people is variable compensation?Twenty percent at most, divided by 26 KPIs,repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent.What difference did it make in their actions,their choices to simplify? Zero.to have zero impact.Now, in front of the new complexity of business,the only solution is not drawing boxeswith reporting lines.It is basically the interplay.How the parts work together.The connections, the interactions, the synapses.of adaptiveness and intelligence.You know, you could call it cooperation, basically.Whenever people cooperate,they use less resources. In everything.You know, the repairability issueis a cooperation problem.When you design cars, please take into accountthe needs of those who will repair the carsin the after sales garages.When we don't cooperate we need more time,more equipment, more systems, more teams.Who will pay for that?Shareholders? Customers?No, they will refuse.who have to compensate through their superindividual efforts for the lack of cooperation.No wonder they disengage.The hard: In banks, when there is a problembetween the back office and the front office,they don't cooperate. What is the solution?They create a middle office.What happens one year later?now I have two problems.Between the back and the middleand between the middle and the front.Plus I have to pay for the middle office.The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation.The soft approach:Improve interpersonal feelings,It is totally wrong.It is even counterproductive.Look, at home I have two TVs. Why?Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife.(Laughter)Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife.And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wifeis precisely because I love my wife.If I didn't love my wife, one TV would be enough:You will watch my favorite football game,if you are not happy, how is the book or the door?(Laughter)The more we like each other,the more we avoid the real cooperationAnd we go for a second TV or we escalatethe decision above for arbitration.Definitely, these approaches are obsolete.To deal with complexity, to enhance the nervous system,based on simple rules.Simple rule number one:Understand what others do.What is their real work?We need to go beyond the boxes,the job descriptions, beyond the surfaceof the container, to understand the real content.Me, designer, if I put a wire here,I know that it will mean that we will have toremove the engine to access the lights.Second, you need to reenforce integrators.existing managers that you reinforceso that they have power and interestto make others cooperate.By removing layers.When there are too many layerspeople are too far from the action,therefore they need KPIs, metrics,they need poor proxies for reality.They don't understand realityand they add the complicatedness of metrics, KPIs.By removing rules -- the bigger we are,the more we need integrators,therefore the less rules we must have,to give discretionary power to managers.And we do the opposite --the bigger we are, the more rules we create.You need to increase the quanitity of powerso that you can empower everybodyto use their judgment, their intelligence.You must give more cards to peopleso that they have the critical mass of cardsto take the risk to cooperate,to move out of insulation.Otherwise, they will withdraw. They will disengage.These rules, they come from game theoryand organizational sociology.You can increase the shadow of the future.Create feedback loops that expose peopleto the consequences of their actions.This is what the automotive company didwhen they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact.They said to the design engineers:of the warranty budget,and if the warranty budget explodes,it will explode in your face. (Laughter)You need also to increase reciprocity,by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient.When you remove these buffers,you hold me by the nose, I hold you by the ear.We will cooperate.Remove the second TV.There are many second TVs at workthat don't create value,they just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency.You need to reward those who cooperateand blame those who don't cooperate.The CEO of The Lego Group,Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, has a great way to use it.He says, blame is not for failure,it is for failing to help or ask for help.It changes everything.on my real weaknesses, my real forecast,because I know I will not be blamed if I fail,but if I fail to help or ask for help.When you do this, it has a lot of implicationson organizational design.You stop drawing boxes, dotted lines, full lines;you look at their interplay.It has a lot of implications on financial policiesthat we use.On human resource management practices.When you do that, you can manage complexity,the new complexity of business,without getting complicated.You create more value with lower cost.because you have removed the common root causethat hinders both.The real battle is not against competitors.This is rubbish, very abstract.When do we meet competitors to fight them?The real battle is against ourselves,against our bureaucracy, our complicatedness.Only you can fight, can do it.Thank you.(Applause)

The entire model of capitalismand the economic model that you and Idid business in,and, in fact, continue to do business in,was built around what probably Milton Friedmanput more succinctly.actually said many, many years ago,the invisible hand,which is, "If you continue to operatein your own self-interestyou will do the best good for society."Now, capitalism has done a lot of good thingsbut equally, it has not been able to meet upwith some of the challenges that we've seenin society.The model that at least I was brought up inwas one which talked aboutwhat I call the three G's of growth:growth that is consistent,quarter on quarter;growth that is competitive,better than the other person;and growth that is profitable,so you continue to makemore and more shareholder value.And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enoughand we have to move from this 3G modelto a model of what I callthe fourth G:the G of growth that is responsible.And it is this that has to becomea very important partof creating value.Of not just creating economic valuebut creating social value.And companies that will thrive are thosethat will actually embrace the fourth G.And the model of 4G is quite simple:in what's happening around in society.They have to begin to play their rolein terms of serving the communitieswhich actually sustain them.And we have to move to a modelof an and/and model which ishow do we make money and do good?How do we make surethat we have a great businessbut we also have a great environment around us?And that modelis all about doing well and doing good.But the question is easier said than done.But how do we actually get that done?And I do believethat the answer to that is going to be leadership.It is going to be to redefinethe new business modelswhich understandthat the only license to operateis to combine these things.And for that you need businessesthat can actually define their rolein societyin terms of a much larger purposethan the products and brands that they sell.And companies that actually define a true north,things that are nonnegotiablewhether times are good, bad, ugly --doesn't matter.There are things that you stand for.Values and purpose are going to be the twodrivers of softwarethat are going to createthe companies of tomorrow.And I'm going to now shiftto talking a little bit about my own experiences.I joined Unilever in 1976as a management trainee in India.And on my first day of workI walked in and my boss tells me,"Do you know why you're here?"I said, "I'm here to sell a lot of soap."You're here to change lives.You know, I thought it was rather facetious.We are a company that sells soap and soup.What are we doing about changing lives?And it's then I realizedthat simple actslike selling a bar of soapcan save more livesthan pharmaceutical companies.I don't know how many of you knowthat five million children don't reach the age of fivebecause of simple infections that can be preventedby an act of washing their hands with soap.We run the largesthand-washing programin the world.We are running a program on hygiene and healththat now touches half a billion people.It's not about selling soap,there is a larger purpose out there.And brands indeed can beat the forefront of social change.And the reason for that is,when two billion people use your brandsthat's the amplifier.Small actions can make a big difference.Take another example,Now those of you who have done thiswill realize that this is no walk in the park.And we had this ladywho was one of our small distributors --beautiful, very, very modest, her home --and she was out there,dressed nicely,her husband in the back, her mother-in-law behindand her sister-in-law behind her.The social order was changingbecause this ladyis part of our Project Shaktithat is actually teaching womenhow to do small businessand how to carry the messageof nutrition and hygiene.We have 60,000 such womennow in India.It's not about selling soap,it's about making surethat in the process of doing soyou can change people's lives.Small actions, big difference.Our R&amp;D folksbut they're working to make sure we use less water.A product that we've just launched recently,One Rinse product that allows you to save waterevery time you wash your clothes.And if we can convert all our users to using this,that's 500 billion liters of water.By the way, that's equivalent to one month of waterfor a whole huge continent.So just think about it.And I can go on and on.Our food chain, our brilliant products --Knorr, Hellman's and all those wonderful products.We are committed to making sure thatall our agricultural raw materialsare sourced from sustainable sources,100-percent sustainable sources.We were the firstto say we are going to buy all of our palm oilfrom sustainable sources.I don't know how many of you know that palm oil,and not buying it from sustainable sources,can create deforestation that is responsiblefor 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world.We were the first to embrace that,and it's all because we market soap and soup.And the point I'm making hereis that companies like yours, companies like minehave to define a purposewhich embraces responsibilityand understands that we have to play our partin the communities in which we operate.We introduced something calledThe Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which said,and we are gong to change the livesof one billion people over 2020."Now the question here is,where do we go from here?And the answer to that is very simple:We're not going to change the world alone.There are plenty of you and plenty of uswho understand this.The question is,we need partnerships, we need coalitionsand importantly, we need that leadershipthat will allow us to take this from hereand to be the changethat we want to see around us.Thank you very much.(Applause)



roger_stein_a_bold_new_way_to_fund_drug_research
883814

So this is a picture of my dad and meat the beach in Far Rockaway,or actually Rockaway Park.I'm the one with the blond hair.My dad's the guy with the cigarette.It was the '60s. A lot of people smoked back then.In the summer of 2009,my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.If you're a man in the United States of the America,you've got about a one in two chanceof being diagnosed with cancer during your lifetime.of being diagnosed with cancer.Everybody knows somebodywho's been diagnosed with cancer.Now, my dad's doing better today,and part of the reason for that is thathe was able to participate in the trialof an experimental new drugthat happened to be specially formulatedand very good for his particular kind of cancer.There are over 200 kinds of cancer.And what I want to talk about today ishow we can help more people like my dad,to fund cancer research.So a while after my dad was diagnosed,I was having coffee with my friend Andrew Lo.where I also have a position,and we were talking about cancer.and one of the things that he had been toldand that he'd learned from studying the literaturewas that there's actually a big bottleneck.It's very difficult to develop new drugs,and the reason it's difficult to develop new drugsis because in the early stages of drug development,the drugs are very risky,and they're very expensive.So Andrew asked me if I'd want tomaybe work with him a bit,work on some of the math and the analyticsNow I'm not a scientist.You know, I don't know how to build a drug.And none of my coauthors, Andrew Loor Jose Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan --none of those guys -- are scientists either.But we know a little bit about risk mitigationand a little bit about financial engineering,and so we started thinking, what could we do?What I'm going to tell you about is some workwe've been doing over the last couple yearsthat we think could fundamentally change the wayWe want to let the research drive the funding,not the other way around.So in order to get started, let me tell youhow you get a drug financed.Imagine that you're in your lab --you're a scientist, you're not like me --you're a scientist, and you've developeda new compound that you think might betherapeutic for somebody with cancer.Well, what you do is, you test in animals,you test in test tubes,but there's this notion of going from the benchto the bedside,and in order to get from the bench, the lab,to the bedside, to the patients,you've got to get the drug tested.And the way the drug gets tested is through a seriesof, basically, experiments,through these large, they're called trials,that they do to determine whether the drug is safeand whether it works and all these things.So the FDA has a very specific protocol.In the first phase of this testing,which is called testing for toxicity,it's called Phase I.and you see if it actually makes them sick.In other words, are the side effects just so severethat no matter how much good it does,it's not going to be worth it?Does it cause heart attacks, kill people,liver failure, this kind of thing?And it turns out, that's a pretty high hurdle.About a third of all drugs drop out at that point.and you see if it actually makes them better.And that's also a higher hurdle. People drop out.is it better than what's available today?If not, then why build it?When you're done with all that,what you have is a very small percentage of drugsSo those blue bottles, those blue bottles save lives,and they're also worth billions,sometimes billions a year.So now here's a question:if I were to ask you, for example,to make a one-time investment of, say,200 million dollarsto buy one of those bottles,so 200 million dollars up front, one time,to buy one of those bottles,I won't tell you which one it is,Does that sound like a good deal for anybody?No. No, right?And of course, it's a very, very risky trial position,and that's why it's very hard to get funding,but to a first approximation,that's actually the proposal.You have to fund these thingsfrom the early stages on. It takes a long time.So Andrew said to me, he said,"What if we stop thinking about these as drugs?but let's throw everything we knowabout financial engineering at them.Let's see if we can use all the tricks of the tradeto figure out how to make these drugswork as financial assets?Let's create a giant fund.In finance, we know what to dowith assets that are risky.You put them in a portfolioand you try to smooth out the returns.So we did some math, and it turned outyou need about 80 to 150 drugs.Now the good news is, there's plenty of drugsthat are waiting to be tested.We've been told that there's a backlogof about 20 years of drugsthat are waiting to be tested but can't be funded.In fact, that early stage of the funding process,that Phase I and pre-clinical stuff,because it's where drugs go to die.It's very hard to for them to get through there,So we did this math, and we figured out, okay,well, you know, you need about 80 to, say, 150,or something like that, drugs.And then we did a little more math, and we said,okay, well that's a fund of aboutthree to 15 billion dollars.So we kind of created a new problemby solving the old one.and there's only one place to get that kind of capital,the capital markets.who traditionally don't invest in this stuff,to want to invest in this stuff.So again, financial engineering was helpful here.Imagine the megafund actually starts empty,and what it does is it issues some debtand some equity,and that generates cash flow.That cash flow is used, then, to buythat big portfolio of drugs that you need,and those drugs start working their waythrough that approval process,they gain value.And most of them don't make it,but a few of them do,and with the ones that gain value, you can sell some,and when you sell them,you have money to pay the interest on those bonds,It's almost self-funding.You do that for the course of the transaction,and when you're done, you liquidate the portfolio,pay back the bonds, and you cangive the equity holders a nice return.So that was the theory, and we talked about itfor a bit, we did a bunch of experiments,and then we said, let's really try to test it.We spent the next two years doing research.We talked to hundreds of experts in drug financingand venture capital.We talked to people who have developed drugs.We talked to pharmaceutical companies.We actually looked at the data for drugs,over 2,000 drugs that had been approved or deniedor withdrawn,and we also ran millions of simulations.And all that actually took a lot of time.But when we were done, what we found was something that was sort of surprising.It was actually feasible to structure that fundsuch that when you were done structuring it,you could actually produce low-risk bondsthat would be attractive to bond holders,and you could produce equityNow those returns aren't going to be attractiveto a venture capitalist.and get those billion dollar payoffs.That's right in the investment sweet spotof pension funds and 401(k) plansand all this other stuff.We published articles in medical journals.We published articles in finance journals.But it wasn't until we actuallygot the popular press interested in thisthat we began to get some traction.We wanted people to get involved.and made that available onlineunder an open-source licenseto anybody that wanted it.And you guys can download it todayAnd that was really effective, because peoplethat didn't believe our assumptionsNow there's an obvious problem, which is,I've told you there's enough drugs,but is there enough money?There's 100 trillion dollars of capitalcurrently invested in fixed-income securities.That's a hundred thousand billion.There's plenty of money.(Laughter)and people had to understand this.And we had a long list, and so what we did waswe assigned a bunch of people, including ourselves,different pieces of this problem,Could you start a work stream onhow you would actually manage so many projects?And we had all these experts get togetherand do these different work streams,and then we held a conference.It was an invitation-only conference.It was sponsored by the American Cancer Societyand done in collaborationwith the National Cancer Institute.including the government, includingpeople that run research centers and so on,It was the first timethat the people who could actually make this happensat across the table from each otherand had these conversations.Now these conferences, it's typical to have a dinner,and at that dinner,you kind of get to know each other,sort of like what we're doing here.I happened to look out the window,and hand on my heart, I looked out the windowand that's what I saw, it was a double rainbow.So I'd like to think it was a good sign.Since the conference, we've got people workingbetween Paris and San Francisco,lots of different folks working on thisto try to see if we can really make it happen.We're not looking to start a fund,but we want somebody else to do this.Because, again, I'm not a scientist.I can't build a drug.I'm never going to have enough moneyto fund even one of those trials.But all of us together, with our 401(k)'s,with our 529 plans, with our pension plans,all of us together can actually fund hundreds of trialsand get paid well for doing itand save millions of lives like my dad.Thank you.(Applause)



toni_griffin_a_new_vision_for_rebuilding_detroit
803088

By 2010, Detroit had become the poster childfor an American city in crisis.There was a housing collapse,an auto industry collapse,and the population had plummeted by 25 percentbetween 2000 and 2010,and many people were beginning to write it off,as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities.By 2010, I had also been asked bythe Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroitto join them in leading a citywide planning processfor the city to create a shared vision for its future.I come to this workas an architect and an urban planner,like Chicago, my hometown;Harlem, which is my current home;Washington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey.All of these cities, to me, still had a numberof unresolved issues related to urban justice,issues of equity, inclusion and access.Now by 2010, as well,popular design magazines were also beginningto take a closer look at cities like Detroit,and devoting whole issues to "fixing the city."I was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein,to do an interview for the October issueof Architect magazine,and he and I kind of had a good chucklewhen we saw the magazine released with the title,"Can This Planner Save Detroit?"because obviously, it's completely absurdthat a single person, let alone a planner,could save a city.But I'm also smiling because I thought it representeda sense of hopefulness that our professioncould play a role in helping the city to think abouthow it would recover from its severe crisis.So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoonand tell you a little bit about our processfor fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit,So we began our process in September of 2010.It's just after a special mayoral election,and word has gotten out that there is going to bethis citywide planning process,which brings a lot of anxiety and fearsamong Detroiters.to introduce the planning process,and people came out from all over the city,including areas that were stable neighborhoods,as well as areas that were beginning to seea lot of vacancy.And most of our audience was representativeof the 82 percent African-American populationin the city at that time.So obviously, we have a Q&amp;A portion of our program,and people line up to mics to ask questions.Many of them step very firmly to the mic,put their hands across their chest, and go,So that question is really powerful,and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment,when you connect it to the storiesthat some Detroiters had,and actually a lot of African-Americans'families have hadthat are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit.Many of them told us the stories abouthow they came to own their homethrough their grandparents or great-grandparents,who were one of 1.6 million people who migratedfrom the rural South to the industrial North,as depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence,"The Great Migration."They came to Detroit for a better way of life.Many found work in the automobile industry,the Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this muralby Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art.The fruits of their labors would afford them a home,and a community with other first-timeAfrican-American home buyers.The first couple of decades of their life in the Northis quite well, up until about 1950,which coincides with the city's peak populationat 1.8 million people.Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to seea second kind of migration,a migration to the suburbs.Between 1950 and 2000,the region grows by 30 percent.But this time, the migration leavesAfrican-Americans in place,as families and businesses flee the city,leaving the city pretty desolate of peopleas well as jobs.the city loses 60 percent of its population,and today it hovers at above 700,000.tell us the stories of what it's like to live in a citywith such depleted population.Many tell us that they're one of only a few homeson their block that are occupied,and that they can see several abandoned homesfrom where they sit on their porches.Citywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes.They can also see vacant property.They're beginning to see illegal activitieson these properties, like illegal dumping,their costs for water, electricity, gas are rising,to help support the services that they need.Citywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels.Now, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale,because I know that sounds like a big number,So the city is 139 square miles.You can fit Boston, San Francisco,and the island of Manhattanwithin its footprint.and we smush it together,it looks like about 20 square miles,and that's roughly equivalent to the sizeof the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan,at 22 square miles.So it's a lot of vacancy.Now some of our audience membersalso tell us about some of the positive thingsthat are happening in their communities,and many of them are banding togetherto take control of some of the vacant lots,and they're starting community gardens,but they're very, very clear to tell usthat this is not enough,that they want to see their neighborhoodsNow there's been a lot of speculation since 2010about what to do with the vacant property,or what we call urban agriculture.So many people would say to us,It can provide fresh foods,and it can put Detroiters back to work too."When I hear that story,I always imagine the folks from the Great Migrationrolling over in their graves,because you can imagine that they didn't sacrificemoving from the South to the Northto create a better life for their families,especially in a city where they camewith little less than a high school educationor even a grammar school educationand were able to afford the basic elementsof the American dream:steady work and a home that they owned.Now, there's a third wave of migrationhappening in Detroit:a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs.These folks see that same vacant landand those same abandoned homesas opportunity for new,entrepreneurial ideas and profit,so much so that former modelscan move to Detroit,buy property, start successfulbusinesses and restaurants,bringing about very positive change.Similarly, we have small manufacturing companiesmaking conscious decisions to relocate to the city.This company, Shinola, which is a luxury watchand bicycle company,deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit,and they quote themselves by sayingthat was still very skilled in how to make things.Now we have community stewardshiphappening in neighborhoods,we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisionsto move to the city and create enterprises,and we have businesses relocating,and this is all in the contextof what is no secret to us all,a city that's under the controlof an emergency manager,and just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.So 2010, we started this process, and by 2013,we released Detroit Future City,which was our strategic plan to guide the cityinto a better and more prosperousand more sustainable existence --not what it was, but what it could be,looking at new ways of economic growth,new forms of land use,more sustainable and denser neighborhoods,and a heightened capacity for civic leadersto take action and implement change.Three key imperatives were really importantto our work.but the economy was too small.There are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit,Secondly, there had to be an acceptancethat we were not going to be able to useall of this vacant land in the way that we had beforeand maybe for some time to come.as we had before,and urban agriculture, while a very productiveand successful intervention happening in Detroit,was not the only answer,that what we had to do is look at these areaswhere we had significant vacancybut still had a significant number of populationof what could be new, productive, innovative,and entrepreneurial usesthat could stabilize those communities,where still nearly 300,000 residents lived.So we came up with one neighborhood typology --where folks could reappropriateabandoned structuresand turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises,with a specific emphasis on looking at the, again,majority 82 percent African-American population.So they, too, could take businessesthat they maybe were doing out of their homeand grow them to more prosperous industriesand actually acquire property so they were actuallyproperty owners as well as business ownersin the communities with which they resided.Then we also wanted to look at other waysof using land in addition to growing foodand transforming landscape intomuch more productive uses,by using surface lakes and retention ponds,that created neighborhood amenities,places of recreation,and actually helped to elevateadjacent property levels.Or we could use it as research plots,where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils,or we could use it to generate energy.So the descendants of the Great Migrationor they can actually grow a businessthat would service companies like Shinola.The good news is, there is a futurefor the next generation of Detroiters,both those there now and those that want to come.So no thank you, Mayor Menino,who recently was quoted as saying,"I'd blow up the place and start over."There are very important people,business and land assets in Detroit,and there are real opportunities there.So while Detroit might not be what it was,Detroit will not die.Thank you.(Applause)



toby_eccles_invest_in_social_change
895922

I'm here today to talk about social change,not a new therapy or a new interventionbut a new business model for social change,a new way of tackling the problem.In Britain, 63 percent of all menwho come out of short sentences from prisonre-offend again within a year.Now how many previous offensesdo you think they have on averagemanaged to commit?Forty-three.Seven.So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice,and we said to the Ministry of Justice,what's it worth to youif fewer of these guys re-offend?It's got to be worth something, right?I mean, there's prison costs,there's police costs, there's court costs,all these things that you're spending money onto deal with these guys. What's it worth?Now, of course, we care about the social value.Social Finance, the organization I helped set up,cares about social stuff.But we wanted to make the economic case,because if we could make the economic case,And if we can agree on both a valueand a way of measuring whether we've beensuccessful at reducing that re-offending,then we can do somethingwe think rather interesting.The idea is called the social impact bond.Now, the social impact bond is simply saying,if we can get the government to agree,that we can create a contract wherethey only pay if it worked.So that means that they can try out new stuffwithout the embarrassmentof having to pay if it didn't work,which for still quite a lot of bits of government,that's a serious issue.Now, many of you may have noticedthere's a problem at this point,and that is that it takes a long time to measurewhether those outcomes have happened.So we have to raise some money.We use the contract to raise moneyfrom socially motivated investors.Socially motivated investors:there's an interesting idea, right?But actually, there's a lot of people who,if they're given the chance,would love to invest in somethingthat does social good.And here's the opportunity.Do you want to also help government findwhether there's a better economic model,not just leaving these guys to come out of prisonbut actually working with themto move to a different pathto end up with fewer crimesand fewer victims?So we find some investors,and they pay for a set of services,and if those services are successful,then they improve outcomes,and with those measured reductions in re-offending,government saves money,and with those savings,they can pay outcomes.And the investors do not just get their money back,but they make a return.So in March 2010, we signedthe first social impact bondwith the Ministry of Justicearound Peterborough Prison.It was to work with 3,000 offenderssplit into three cohorts of 1,000 each.Now, each of those cohortswould get measured over the two yearsthat they were coming out of prison.They've got to have a year to commit their crimes,six months to get through the court system,and then they would be compared to a grouptaken from the police national computer,as similar as possible,and we would get paidfor every conviction event that didn't happen.So we get paid for crimes saved.Now if we achieved that 10-percent reductionacross all three cohorts,then the investors get a seven and a half percentannualized return on their investment,and if we do better than that,they can get up to 13 percentannualized return on their investment,which is okay.So everyone wins here, right?The Ministry of Justice can try out a new programand they only pay if it works.Investors get two opportunities:for the first time, they can invest in social change.Also, they make a reasonable return,and they also know thatfirst investors in these kinds of things,they're going to have to believers.They're going to have to care in the social program,but if this builds a track recordover five or 10 years,then you can widen that investor communityas more people have confidence in the product.The service providers, well, for the first time,they've got an opportunity to provide servicesand grow the evidence for what they're doingin a really constructive way and learnand demonstrate the value of what they're doingover five or six years, not just one or twoas often happens at the moment.Society wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims.Now, the offenders, they also benefit.Instead of just coming out of the prisonwith 46 pounds in their pocket,half of them not knowing where they're spendingtheir first night out of jail,actually, someone meets them in prison,learns about their issues,meets them at the gate,takes them through to somewhere to stay,drug rehabilitation, mental health,whatever's needed.So let's think of another example:working with children in care.Social impact bonds work greatfor any area where there is at the momentvery expensive provision that producespoor outcomes for people.So children in the state caretend to do very badly.Only 13 percent achieve a reasonable levelof five GCSEs at 16,against 58 percent of the wider population.More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prisonhave spent some time in care.And even more worryingly,and this is a Home Office statistic,70 percent of prostituteshave spent some time in care.The state is not a great parent.But there are great programsfor adolescents who are on the edge of care,and 30 percent of kids going into careare adolescents.So we set up a program with Essex County Councilto test out intensive family therapeutic supportfor those families with adolescentson the edge of the care system.Essex only pays in the eventthat it's saving them care costs.Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds.That program started last month.Others, around homelessness in London,around youth and employment and educationelsewhere in the country.There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain,and amazing levels of interest in this ideaall over the world.So David Cameron's put 20 million poundsinto a social outcomes fund to support this idea.Obama has suggested 300 million dollarsin the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideasand structures to move it forward,and a lot of other countriesare demonstrating considerable interest.So what's caused this excitement?Why is this so different for people?Well, the first piece, which we've talked about,is innovation.It enables testing of new ideasin a way that's less difficult for everybody.The second piece it brings is rigor.By working to outcomes, people really have to testSo taking Peterborough as an example,we add case managementso they knowwhat actually has been done with different prisoners,and at the same time they learnfrom the Ministry of Justice, and we learn,because we pushed for the data,And we learn and adapt the program accordingly.And this leads to the third element, which is new,and that's flexibility.Because normal contracting for things,when you're spending government money,you're spending our money, tax money,Now any entrepreneur in the room knowsthat version 1.0, the business plan,is not the one that generally works.So when you're trying to do something like this,you need the flexibility to adapt the program.And again, in Peterborough, we started offwith a program, but we also collected data,and over the period of time,we nuanced and changed that programto add a range of other elements,so that the service adaptsand we meet the needs of the long termas well as the short term:greater engagement from the prisoners,longer-term engagement as well.The last element is partnership.state's better, public sector's better,private sector's better, social sector's better,for a lot of these programs.Actually, for creating social change,we need to bring in the expertisefrom all of those partiesin order to make this work.And this creates a structurethrough which they can combine.So where does this leave us?This leaves us with a waythat people can invest in social change.We've met thousands, possibly millions of people,who want the opportunity to invest in social change.We've met champions all over the public sectorkeen to make these kinds of differences.With this kind of model,we can help bring them together.Thank you.(Applause)



robin_nagle_what_i_discovered_in_new_york_city_trash

I was about 10 years oldon a camping trip with my dadin the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness areain the northern part of New York State.It was a beautiful day.The forest was sparkling.The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,and if it weren't for the path we were following,we could almost pretend we werethe first human beings to ever walk that land.We got to our campsite.It was a lean-to on a blufflooking over a crystal, beautiful lake,when I discovered a horror.Behind the lean-to was a dump,maybe 40 feet squarewith rotting apple coresand balled-up aluminum foil,and a dead sneaker.And I was astonished,I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.The campers who were too lazyto take out what they had brought in,who did they think would clean up after them?That question stayed with me,and it simplified a little.Who cleans up after us?However you configureor wherever you place the us,who cleans up after us in Istanbul?Who cleans up after us in Rioor in Paris or in London?Here in New York,the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbageand 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.I wanted to get to know them as individuals.I wanted to understand who takes the job.What's it like to wear the uniformand bear that burden?So I started a research project with them.I rode in the trucks and walked the routesand interviewed people in offices and facilitiesall over the city,and I learned a lot,but I was still an outsider.I needed to go deeper.So I took the job as a sanitation worker.I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.It was a remarkable privilegeand an amazing education.Everyone asks about the smell.It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think,and on days when it is really bad,you get used to it rather quickly.The weight takes a long time to get used to.I knew people who were several years on the jobwhose bodies were still adjusting to the burdenof bearing on your bodytons of trash every week.Then there's the danger.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerousoccupations in the country,and I learned why.You're in and out of traffic all day,and it's zooming around you.It just wants to get past you, so it's oftenthe motorist is not paying attention.That's really bad for the worker.And then the garbage itself is full of hazardsthat often fly back out of the truckand do terrible harm.I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.When you step off the curband you see a city from behind a truck,you come to understand that trashis like a force of nature unto itself.It never stops coming.It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.It must always be in motion.And then there's the stigma.You put on the uniform, and you become invisibleuntil someone is upset with you for whatever reasonlike you've blocked traffic with your truck,or you're taking a break too close to their home,or you're drinking coffee in their diner,and they will come and scorn you,and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.I find the stigma especially ironic,because I strongly believe that sanitation workersare the most important labor forceon the streets of the city, for three reasons.They are the first guardians of public health.If they're not taking away trashefficiently and effectively every day,it starts to spill out of its containments,and the dangers inherent to it threaten usin very real ways.Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuriesburst forth again and start to harm us.The economy needs them.If we can't throw out the old stuff,we have no room for the new stuff,so then the engines of the economystart to sputter when consumption is compromised.I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.And then there's what I callour average, necessary quotidian velocity.By that I simply meanhow fast we're used to movingin the contemporary day and age.We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry aroundour coffee cup, our shopping bag,our bottle of water.We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,because we know there's a workforceon the other side that's going to take it all away.So I want to suggest today a couple of waysto think about sanitation that will perhaps helpameliorate the stigmaand bring them into this conversationof how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical.They're on the streets every day, rhythmically.They wear a uniform in many cities.You know when to expect them.And their work lets us do our work.They are almost a form of reassurance.The flow that they maintainkeeps us safe from ourselves,from our own dross, our cast-offs,and that flow must be maintained alwaysno matter what.On the day after September 11 in 2001,I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairsand there was a man doing his paper recycling routelike he did every Wednesday.And I tried to thank him for doing his workon that day of all days,but I started to cry.And he looked at me,and he just nodded, and he said,"We're going to be okay.We're going to be okay."It was a little while later that I startedmy research with sanitation,and I met that man again.His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,and we became good friends.I want to believe that Paulie was right.We are going to be okay.But in our effort to reconfigurehow we as a species exist on this planet,we must include and take account ofall the costs, including the very real human costof the labor.And we also would be well informedto reach out to the people who do that workand get their expertiseon how do we think about,how do we create systems around sustainabilitythat perhaps take us from curbside recycling,which is a remarkable success across 40 years,across the United States and countries around the world,and lift us up to a broader horizonwhere we're looking at other forms of wastethat could be lessenedfrom manufacturing and industrial sources.Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.It's a remarkable statistic.So in the flow of your days,in the flow of your lives,next time you see someone whose job isto clean up after you,take a moment to acknowledge them.Take a moment to say thank you.(Applause)

In December of 2010,the city of Apatzingánin the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico,awoke to gunfire.For two straight days,the city became an open battlefieldbetween the federal forcesand a well-organized group,presumably from the local criminal organization,La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfirebut also explosionsand burning trucks used as barricades across the city,so truly like a battlefield.After these two days,and during a particularly intense encounter,it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,Nazario Moreno, was killed.In response to this terrifying violence,the mayor of Apatzingándecided to call the citizens to a march for peace.The idea was to ask for a softer approachto criminal activity in the state.And so, the day of the scheduled procession,thousands of people showed up.As the mayor was preparing to deliverthe speech starting the march,his team noticedthat, while half of the participantswere appropriately dressed in white,and bearing banners asking for peace,the other half was actually marchingin support of the criminal organizationand its now-presumed-defunct leader.Shocked, the mayor decided to step asiderather than participate or lead a processionthat was ostensibly in support of organized crime.And so his team stepped aside.The two marches joined together,and they continued their pathtowards the state capital.This story of horrific violencefollowed by a fumbled approachby federal and local authorities as they triedto engage civil society,who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,where we see that our current understandingof drug violence and what leads to itis probably at the very least incomplete.If you decided to spend 30 minutes tryingto figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexicoby, say, just researching online,the first thing you would find out is thatwhile the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,there are some that are moreand there are some that are much less equal than others,because you will quickly find outthat in the past six yearsanywhere between 60 and 100,000 peoplehave lost their lives in drug-related violence.To put these numbers in perspective,this is eight times larger than the number of casualtiesin the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.It's also shockingly close to the number of peoplewho have died in the Syrian civil war,which is an active civil war.This is happening just south of the border.Now as you're reading, however,you will be maybe surprised that you will quicklybecome numb to the numbers of deaths,because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbersof faceless, nameless dead people.Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrativethat all the people who are dyingwere somehow involved in the drug trade,and we infer this because they were either torturedor executed in a professional manner,or, most likely, both.And so clearly they were criminalsbecause of the way they died.And so the narrative is that somehow these peoplegot what they were deserved.They were part of the bad guys.And that creates some form of comfortfor a lot of people.However, while it's easier to thinkof us, the citizens, the police, the army,as the good guys, and them, the narcos,the carteles, as the bad guys,if you think about it,the latter are only providing a service to the former.Whether we like it or not,the U.S. is the largest marketfor illegal substances in the world,accounting for more than half of global demand.It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexicothat is its only route of access from the South,and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,used to say, "Poor Mexico,so far from God and so close to the United States."The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million usersof illegal drugs in the United States.Using very, very conservative assumptions,this yields a yearly drug market on the retail sideof anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.If we assume that the narcos only have accessto the wholesale part, which we know is false,that still leaves you with yearly revenuesof anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.To put these numbers in perspective,Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.And it so happens that this is a product that,because of its nature, a business modelto address this market requires youto guarantee to your producersthat their product will be reliably placedin the markets where it is consumed.And the only way to do this, because it's illegal,is to have absolute control of the geographic corridorsthat are used to transport drugs.Hence the violence.If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,you will see that it almost perfectly alignswith the most efficient routes of transportationfrom the south to the north.The only thing that the cartels are doingis that they're trying to protect their business.It's not only a multi-billion dollar market,but it's also a complex one.For example, the coca plant is a fragile plantthat can only grow in certain latitudes,and so it means that a business modelto address this market requires you to havedecentralized, international production,that by the way needs to have good quality control,because people need a good highthat is not going to kill themand that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.And so that means they need to secureproduction and quality control in the south,and you need to ensure that you haveefficient and effective distribution channelsin the markets where these drugs are consumed.I urge you, but only a little bit,because I don't want to get you in trouble,to just ask around and see how difficult it would beto get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,and some of you may be surprised to knowthat there are many dealers that offer a servicewhere if you send them a text message,they guarantee delivery of the drugin 30 minutes or less.Think about this for a second.Think about the complexityof the distribution network that I just described.It's very difficult to reconcile thiswith the image of faceless, ignorant goonsthat are just shooting each other,very difficult to reconcile.Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,an effective organization requiresan integrated strategy that includesa good organizational structure, good incentives,a solid identity and good brand management.This leads me to the second thing that you would learnin your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.Because you would quickly realize,and maybe be confused by the fact,that there are three organizationsthat are constantly named in the articles.You will hear about Los Zetas,the Knights Templar, which is the new brandfor the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,and the Sinaloa Federation.You will read that Los Zetas is this assortmentof sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enterand they silence the press,and this is somewhat true, or mostly true.But this is the result of a very careful brandingand business strategy.You see, Los Zetas is not justthis random assortment of individuals,but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.When that corridor became contested, they decidedthat they wanted to recruita professional enforcement arm.So they recruited Los Zetas:an entire unit of elite paratroopersfrom the Mexican Army.They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,so much so that at some point, they decidedto just take over the operations,which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,because they grow up.Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason,they lost some of the linkages to the production and distributionin the most profitable markets like cocaine,but what they did have,and this is again based on their military origin,was a perfectly structured chain of commandwith a very clear hierarchyand a very clear promotion path that allowed themto supervise and operate across many, many marketsvery effectively,which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.And so because they didn't have accessto the more profitable drug markets,this pushed them and gave them the opportunityto diversify into other forms of crime.That includes kidnapping, prostitution,local drug dealing and human trafficking,including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.So what they currently run is trulyand quite literally a franchise business.They focus most of their recruiting on the army,and they very openly advertise for better salaries,better benefits, better promotion paths,not to mention much better food,than what the army can deliver.The way they operate is thatwhen they arrive in a locality,they let people know that they are there,and they go to the most powerful local gangand they say, "I offer youto be the local representative of the Zeta brand."If they agree -- and you don't want to knowwhat happens if they don't --they train them and they supervise themon how to run the most efficient criminal operationfor that town, in exchange for royalties.This kind of business model obviously dependsentirely on having a very effective brand of fear,and so Los Zetascarefully stage acts of violencethat are spectacular in nature,especially when they arrive first in a city,but again, that's just a brand strategy.I'm not saying they're not violent,but what I am saying is that even though you will readthat they are the most violent of all,when you count, when you do the body count,they're actually all the same.In contrast to them, the Knights Templarthat arose in Michoacánemerged in reaction to the incursionof the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.Michoacán is a geographically strategic statebecause it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,which then gives you direct access to the U.S.The Knights Templar realized very quicklythat they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,and so they developed a strategyas a social enterprise.They brand themselves as representative ofand protecting of the citizens of Michoacánagainst organized crime.Their brand of social enterprise meansthat they require a lot of civic engagement,so they invest heavily in providing local services,like dealing with home violence,going after petty criminals, treating addicts,and keeping drugs out of the local marketswhere they are,and, of course, protecting peoplefrom other criminal organizations.Now, they kill a lot of people too,but when they kill them,they provide very careful narratives and descriptionsfor why they did them,through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,and billboards that explain that the people who were killedwere killed because they represented a threatnot to us, as an organization, of course,but to you, as citizens.And so we're actually here to protect you.They, as social enterprises do,have created a moral and ethical codethat they advertise around,and they have very strict recruiting practices.And here you have the types of explanationsthat they provide for some of their actions.They have actually retained accessto the profitable drug trade,but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán,and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas,they leverage that to, for example,trade copper from Michoacán that is legally createdand legally extractedwith illegal ephedrine from Chinawhich is a critical precursor for methamphetaminesthat they produce, and then they have partnershipswith larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federationthat place their products in the U.S.Finally, the Sinaloa Federation.When you read about them, you will often read about themwith an undertone of reverence and admiration,because they are the most integratedand the largest of all the Mexican organizations,and, many people argue, the world.They started as just sort of a transport organizationthat specialized in smuggling between the U.S.and the Mexican borders,but now they have growninto a truly integrated multinationalthat has partnerships in production in the southand partnerships in global distributionacross the planet.They have cultivated a brand of professionalism,business acumen and innovation.They have designed new drug productsand new drug processes.They have designed narco-tunnelsthat go across the border,and you can see that these are not"The Shawshank Redemption" types.They have invented narco-submarines and boatsthat are not detected by radar.They have invented drones to transport drugs,catapults, you name it.One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federationactually made it to the Forbes list.[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]Like any multinational would, they have specializedand focused only in the most profitable part of the business,which is high-margin drugs like cocaine,heroine, methamphetamines.Like any traditional Latin American multinational would,the way they control their operationsis through family ties.When they're entering a new market, they senda family member to supervise it,or, if they're partnering with a new organization,they create a family tie,either through marriages or other types of ties.Like any other multinational would,they protect their brand by outsourcingthe more questionable parts of the business model,like for example, when they have to engagein violence against other criminal organizations,they recruit gangs and other smaller playersto do the dirty work for them,and they try to separate their operationsand their violence and be very discrete about this.To further strengthen their brand,they actually have professional P.R. firmsthat shape how the press talks about them.They have professional videographers on staff.They have incredibly productive tieswith the security organizationson both sides of the border.And so, differences aside,what these three organizations shareis on the one hand, a very clear understandingthat institutions cannot be imposed from the top,but rather they are built from the bottom upone interaction at a time.They have created extremely coherent structuresthat they use to show the inconsistenciesin government policies.And so what I want you to remember from this talkare three things.The first one is that drug violenceis actually the resultof a huge market demandand an institutional setup that forcesthe servicing of this market to necessitate violenceto guarantee delivery routes.The second thing I want you to rememberis that these are sophisticated,coherent organizationsthat are business organizations,and analyzing them and treating them as suchis probably a much more useful approach.The third thing I want you to rememberis that even though we're more comfortablewith this idea of "them,"a set of bad guys separated from us,we are actually accomplices to them,either through our direct consumptionor through our acceptance of the inconsistencybetween our policies of prohibitionand our actual behavior of toleranceor even encouragement of consumption.These organizations service, recruit from,and operate within our communities,so necessarily, they are much more integratedwithin them than we are comfortable acknowledging.And so to me the question is not whetherthese dynamics will continue the way they have.We see that the nature of this phenomenonguarantees that they will.The question is whether we are willing to continueour support of a failed strategybased on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignoranceat the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.Thank you.(Applause)

Have you ever asked yourselves why it is thatcompanies, the really cool companies,the innovative ones, the creative,new economy-type companies --Apple, Google, Facebook --are coming out of one particular country,the United States of America?Usually when I say this, someone says, "Spotify!That's Europe." But, yeah.It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.Now what I do is I'm an economist,and I actually study the relationshipbetween innovation and economic growthat the level of the company, the industry and the nation,and I work with policymakers worldwide,especially in the European Commission,but recently also in interesting places like China,and I can tell you that that questionis on the tip of all of their tongues:Where are the European Googles?What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,which they understand is differentfrom this old economy growth model?And what is interesting is that often,even if we're in the 21st century,we kind of come down in the end to these ideasof market versus state.It's talked about in these modern ways,but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley,the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms,the private initiative, whether this be abouta dynamic venture capital sectorthat's actually able to provide that high-risk financeto these innovative companies,the gazelles as we often call them,which traditional banks are scared of,or different types of really successfulcommercialization policies which actually allow these companiesto bring these great inventions, their products,to the market and actually get over thisreally scary Death Valley periodin which many companies instead fail.But what really interests me, especially nowadaysand because of what's happening politically around the world,is the language that's used, the narrative,the discourse, the images, the actual words.So we often are presentedwith the kind of words like that the private sectoris also much more innovative because it's able tothink out of the box.They are more dynamic.Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speechto the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,where he said to be innovative,you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.Right? So these guys are kind of the hungryand foolish and colorful guys, right?And in places like Europe,it might be more equitable,we might even be a bit better dressedand eat better than the U.S.,but the problem is this damn public sector.It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowedthese things like dynamic venture capitaland commercialization to actually be able to reallybe as fruitful as it could.And even really respectable newspapers,some that I'm actually subscribed to,the words they use are, you know,the state as this Leviathan. Right?This monster with big tentacles.They're very explicit in these editorials.They say, "You know, the state, it's necessaryto fix these little market failureswhen you have public goodsor different types of negative externalities like pollution,but you know what, what is the next big revolutiongoing to be after the Internet?We all hope it might be something green,or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say --this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution --they say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right?Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools.Even fund the basic research, because this ispopularly recognized, in fact, as a big public goodwhich private companies don't want to invest in,do that, but you know what?Leave the rest to the revolutionaries."Those colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers.They're often called garage tinkerers,because some of them actually did some things in garages,even though that's partly a myth.And so what I want to do with you in, oh God,only 10 minutes,is to really think again this juxtaposition,because it actually has massive, massive implicationsbeyond innovation policy,which just happens to be the areathat I often talk with with policymakers.It has huge implications, even with this whole notionthat we have on where, when and whywe should actually be cutting back on public spendingand different types of public services which,of course, as we know, are increasingly beingoutsourced because of this juxtaposition.Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schoolsis in order to make them more innovative without being emburdenedby this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.So these kind of words are constantly,these juxtapositions come up everywhere,not just with innovation policy.And so to think again,there's no reason that you should believe me,so just think of some of the smartestrevolutionary things that you have in your pocketsand do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.Ask who actually funded the really cool,revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-boxthings in the iPhone.What actually makes your phonea smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?So the Internet, which you can surf the webanywhere you are in the world;GPS, where you can actually know where you areanywhere in the world;the touchscreen display, which makes it alsoa really easy-to-use phone for anybody.These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone,and they're all government-funded.And the point is that the Internetwas funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA.The touchscreen display was fundedby two public grants by the CIA and the NSFto two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.Now, you might be thinking, "Well, she's just saidthe word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,"but what's really interesting is that this is actually truein sector after sector and department after department.So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personallyvery interested in because I've actually had the fortuneto study it in quite some depth,is wonderful to be asking this questionabout the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits,because each and every medicine can actually bedivided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.So the new molecular entities with priority ratingare the revolutionary new drugs,whereas the slight variations of existing drugs --Viagra, different color, different dosage --are the less revolutionary ones.And it turns out that a full 75 percentof the new molecular entities with priority ratingare actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs.This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.They do. They spend on the marketing part.They spend on the D part of R&amp;D.They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock,which is quite problematic.In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recentlyhave spent more money in buying back their sharesto boost their stock price than on R&amp;D,but that's a whole different TED Talk which one dayI'd be fascinated to tell you about.Now, what's interesting in all of thisis the state, in all these examples,was doing so much more than just fixing market failures.It was actually shaping and creating markets.It was funding not only the basic research,which again is a typical public good,but even the applied research.It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.So these SBIR and SDTR programs,which give small companies early-stage financehave not only been extremely importantcompared to private venture capital,but also have become increasingly important.Why? Because, as many of us know,V.C. is actually quite short-term.They want their returns in three to five years.Innovation takes a much longer time than that,15 to 20 years.And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?Who's actually funding the hard stuff?Of course, it's not just the state.The private sector does a lot.But the narrative that we've always been toldis the state is important for the basics,but not really providing that sort of high-risk,revolutionary thinking out of the box.In all these sectors, from funding the Internetto doing the spending, but also the envisioning,the strategic vision, for these investments,it was actually coming within the state.The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinatingto study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology,came from within government.And so there's huge implications of this.First of all, of course I'm not someone,this old-fashioned person, market versus state.What we all know in dynamic capitalismis that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.But the point is, by constantly depictingthe state part as necessarybut actually -- pffff -- a bit boringand often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,I think we've actually really stunted the possibilityto build these public-private partnershipsin a really dynamic way.Even the words that we often use to justify the "P" part,the public part -- well, they're both P's --with public-private partnershipsis in terms of de-risking.What the public sector did in all these examplesI just gave you, and there's many more,which myself and other colleagues have been looking at,is doing much more than de-risking.It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.But also, I'm sure you all have had experiencewith local, regional, national governments,and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him."That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,boring, it's sometimesthat we actually create those organizations in that way.So what we have to actually do is buildthese entrepreneurial state organizations.DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,actually thought really hard about this,how to welcome failure, because you will fail.You will fail when you innovative.One out of 10 experiments has any success.And the V.C. guys know this,and they're able to actually fund the other lossesfrom that one success.And this brings me, actually, probably,to the biggest implication,and this has huge implications beyond innovation.If the state is more than just a market fixer,if it actually is a market shaper,and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,what happened to the reward?We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,and so some people are foolish enoughor probably smart enough if they have time to wait,to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher riskwhich over time will make a greater reward than bonds,that whole risk-reward thing.Well, where's the reward for the stateof having taken on these massive risksand actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?The Internet was crazy.It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.You had to be completely nuts to do it,and luckily, they were.Now, we don't even get to this question about rewardsunless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.And the problem is that economists often think,well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax.You know, the companies will pay tax,the jobs they create will create growthso people who get those jobs and their incomes risewill come back to the state through the tax mechanism.Well, unfortunately, that's not true.Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.Globalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.I mean, one can take a position on that.But also these companiesthat have actually had this massive benefit from the state --Apple's a great example.They even got the first -- well, not the first,but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company,through this SBIC program,which predated the SBIR program,as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.And yet we know they legally,as many other companies, pay very little tax back.So what we really need to actually rethinkis should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanismthat's much more direct than tax. Why not?It could happen perhaps through equity.This, by the way, in the countriesthat are actually thinking about this strategically,countries like Finland in Scandinavia,but also in China and Brazil,they're retaining equity in these investments.Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,it's a public funding agency in Finland,which then funded the next round of Nokias.The Brazilian Development Bank,which is providing huge amounts of funds todayto clean technology, they just announceda $56 billion program for the future on this,is retaining equity in these investments.So to put it provocatively,had the U.S. government thought about this,and maybe just brought backjust something called an innovation fund,you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percentof the profits from what the Internet producedhad come back to that innovation fund,there would be so much more moneyto spend today on green technology.Instead, many of the state budgetswhich in theory are trying to do thatare being constrained.But perhaps even more important,we heard before about the one percent,the 99 percent.If the state is thought about in this more strategic way,as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism,because that's what we're talking about, right?Who are the different players in creating valuein the economy, and is the state's role,has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?If we can actually have a broader theoryof value creation and allow us to actually admitwhat the state has been doing and reap something back,it might just be that in the next round,and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolutionwill in fact be green,that that period of growthwill not only be smart, innovation-led,not only green, but also more inclusive,so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valleycan actually also benefit from that growth,because they have not.Thank you.(Applause)

Africa is booming.Per capita incomes since the year 2000have doubled,and this boom is impacting on everyone.Life expectancy has increased by one yearevery three years for the last decade.That means if an African child is born today,rather than three days ago,they will get an extra day of lifeat the end of their lifespan.It's that quick.And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent:600,000 less people a year are getting HIVin sub-Saharan Africa.The battle against malaria is being won,with deaths from malaria down 27 percent,according to the latest World Bank data.And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.This shouldn't surprise us,because actually, everybody grows.If you go back to Imperial Romein the Year 1 A.D.,there was admittedly about 1,800 yearswhere there wasn't an awful lot of growth.But then the people that the Romanswould have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors,were actually part of the Industrial Revolution,and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate,and you saw that get quicker and quicker,and it's been impacting everyone.It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singaporeor the tundra of northern Finland.Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of whenthe inevitable happens.Among the reasons I think it's happening right nowis the quality of the leadership across Africa.I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s,the greatest politician in the world was African,but I'm meeting brilliant peopleacross the continent the entire time,and they're doing the reformswhich have transformed the economic situationfor their countries.And the West is engaging with that.The West has given debt forgiveness programswhich have halved sub-Saharan debtfrom about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40.At the same time, our debt level's gone up to 120and we're all feeling slightly miserableas a result.Politics gets weaker when debt is high.When public sector debt is low,governments don't have to choosebetween investing in education and healthand paying interest on that debt you owe.And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good.The private sector as well.Again, in the West, we have private sector debtof 200 percent of GDP in Spain,the U.K., and the U.S.That's an awful lot of debt.Africa, many African countries,are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP.If there's any continent that can do what China has done --China's at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart --if anyone can do what China has donein the last 30 years,it'll be Africa in the next 30.So they've got great government finances, great private sector debt.Does anyone recognize this? In fact, they do.Foreign direct investmenthas poured into Africa in the last 15 years.Back in the '70s,no one touched the continent with a barge pole.And this investment is actually Western-led.We hear a lot about China,and they do lend a lot of money,but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of yearshas come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada.Ten percent's come from India.And they're investing in energy.Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now.It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia.And they're investing in telecoms,shopping malls.And this very encouraging story, I think,is partly demographic-led.And it's not just about African demographics.I'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-oldsin various parts of the world,and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second.Ten years ago, say you're Foxconnsetting up an iPhone factory, by chance.You might choose China,which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line,where there's 200 million young people,and every year until 2010 that's getting bigger.Which means you're going to have new guysknocking on the door saying, "Give us a job,"and, "I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job."Now, that's completely changed now.This decade, we're going to see a 20- to 30-percentfall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China.So where do you set up your new factory?You look at South Asia, and people are.They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh,and they're also looking at Africa.And they're looking at Africabecause that yellow line is showing youthat the number of young Africansis going to continue to get biggerdecade after decade after decade out to 2050.Now, there's a problem with lots of young peoplecoming into any market,particularly when they're young men.A bit dangerous, sometimes.I think one of the crucial factorsis how educated is that demographic?If you look at the red line here,what you're going to see is that in 1975,just nine percent of kidswere in secondary school educationin sub-Saharan Africa.Would you set up a factoryin sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?Nobody else did.They chose instead Turkey and Mexicoto set up the textiles factories,because their education levelswere 25 to 30 percent.Today, sub-Sahara is at the levelsthat Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975.They will get the textiles jobsthat will take people out of rural povertyand put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.So what's Africa looking like today?This is how I look at Africa.It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.Each little box is about a billion dollars,and you see that I pay an awful lot of attentionto Nigeria sitting there in the middle.South Africa is playing a role.But when I'm thinking about the future,I'm actually most interestedin Central, Western and Southern Africa.If I look at Africa by population,East Africa stands outas so much potential.And I'm showing you something else with these maps.I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy.Fragile democracies is the beige color.Strong democracies are the orange color.And what you'll see here is that most Africansare now living in democracies.Why does that matter?Because what people wantis what politicians try,they don't always succeed, but they try and deliver.And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on.In Ghana in the elections, in December 2012,the battle between the two candidateswas over education.One guy offered free secondary school educationto all, not just 30 percent.The other guy had to say,I'm going to build 50 new schools.He won by a margin.So democracy is encouraging governmentsto invest in education.Education is helping growth and investment,and that's giving budget revenues,which is giving governments more money,which is helping growth through education.It's a positive, virtuous circle.But I get asked this question,and this particular question makes me quite sad:It's, "But what about corruption?How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?"And what makes me sad about itis that this graph here is showing youthat the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth.When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.And the countries on the right hand side,you'll see the per capita GDP,basically every countrywith a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars,has got a corruption scoreof roughly, what's that, about three?Three out of 10. That's not good.Every poor country is corrupt.Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt.How do you get from poverty and corruptionto wealth and less corruption?You see the middle class grow.And the way to do that is to invest,not to say I'm not investing in that continentbecause there's too much corruption.Now, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption.I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe --not in Africa, actually.But what I'm saying here is thatwe can make a differenceand we can do that by investing.Now I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret.Economists aren't great at forecasting.Because the question really is, what happens next?And if you go back to the year 2000,what you'll find is The Economisthad a very famous cover, "The Hopeless Continent,"and what they'd done is they'd looked at growthin Africa over the previous 10 years -- two percent --and they said,what's going to happen in the next 10 years?They assumed two percent,and that made it a pretty hopeless story,because population growth was two and a half.People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s.Now 2012, The Economist has a new cover,and what does that new cover show?That new cover shows, well, Africa rising,because the growth over the last 10 yearshas been about five and a half percent.I would like to see if you can all now become economists,because if growth for the last 10 yearshas been five and a half percent,what do you think the IMF is forecastingfor the next five years of growth in Africa?Very good. I think you're secretly sayingto your head, probably five and a half percent.You're all economists, and I think,like most economists, wrong.No offense.What I like to do is try and find the countriesthat are doing exactly what Africa has already done,and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothingto whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof.India is one of those examples.This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010.Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second.Actually, for the first 20 years,the '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow.It grew at two percentwhen population growth was about two and a half.If that's familiar, that's exactly what happenedin sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s.And then something happened in 1980.Boom! India began to explode.It wasn't a "Hindu rate of growth,""democracies can't grow." Actually India could.And if I lay sub-Saharan growthon top of the Indian growth story,it's remarkably similar.Twenty years of not much growthand a trend line which is actually telling youthat sub-Saharan African growth isslightly better than India.And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this,I'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa,I'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India,I can draw out some forecastsfor the next 30 to 40 yearswhich I think are betterthan the ones where you're looking backwards.And that tells me this:that Africa is going to gofrom a $2 trillion economy todayto a $29 trillion economy by 2050.Now that's bigger than Europe and Americaput together in today's money.Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years.The population's going to doublefrom one billion to two billion,so household incomes are going to go up sevenfoldin the next 35 years.And when I present this in Africa --Nairobi, Lagos, Accra -- I get one question."Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?"And you know what?Actually, I think they've got a point.Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned,yes from the positives in Asia and India,but also the negatives?Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made.Surely, the technologies that we're talking about herethis last week,surely some of these can perhapshelp Africa grow even faster?And I think here we can play a role.Because technology does let you help.You can go and downloadsome of the great African literaturefrom the Internet now.No, not right now, just 30 seconds.You can go and buy some of the great tunes.My iPod's full of them.Buy African products.Go on holiday and see for yourselfthe change that's happening.Invest.Perhaps hire people, give them the skillsthat they can take back to Africa,and their companies will grow an awful lot fasterthan most of ours here in the West.And then you and I can help make surethat for Africa, the 21st century is their century.Thank you very much.(Applause)

I've spent my life working on sustainability.I set up a climate change NGOcalled The Climate Group.I worked on forestry issues in WWF.I worked on development and agriculture issuesin the U.N. system.About 25 years in total,and then three years ago, I found myself talking toIKEA's CEO about joining his team.Like many people here, well,I want to maximize my personal impact in the world,so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.But first, let's just take three numbers.The first number is three:three billion people.This is the number of people joiningthe global middle class by 2030,coming out of poverty.It's fantastic for them and their families,but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,and this swells that number to five,a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.The second number is six:This is six degrees centigrade,what we're heading towards in terms of global warming.We're not heading towards one degree or three degreesor four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.And if you think about it, all of the weird weatherwe've been having the last few years,much of that is due to just one degree warming,and we need CO2 emissions to peakby the end of this decade globallyand then come down.It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.The third number is 12:That's the number of cities in the worldthat had a million or more peoplewhen my grandmother was born.You can see my grandmother there.That was in the beginning of the last century.So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,the ninth largest city in the world.Now there are 500 cities, nearly,with a million people or more in them.And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,that's the century when we build all the world's cities,the century that we're in the middle of right now.Every other century was kind of practice,and this lays down a blueprint for how we live.So think about it.We're building cities like never before,bringing people out of poverty like never before,and changing the climate like never before.Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-doto a must-do.it's about what we do right here, right now,and for the rest of our working lives.So I'm going to talk a little bit aboutwhat business can doand what a business like IKEA can do,and we have a sustainability strategycalled "people and planet positive"to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.Why would we not want to have a positive impacton the world as a business?Other companies have sustainability strategies.I'm going to refer to some of those as well,and I'm just going to mention a fewof the commitments as illustrations that we've got.But first, let's think of customers.We know from asking people from China to the U.S.that the vast majority of people care about sustainabilityafter the day-to-day issues,the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?Can I pay the bills at the end of the month?Then they care about big issues like climate change.But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,and they expect business to help,and they're a little bit disappointed today.So take your mind back and thinkof the first sustainable products.We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.We had the early energy-efficient light bulbsthat took five minutes to warm upand then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.So every time you pulled on a t-shirt,or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,or sometimes all three together,you were reminded sustainability was about compromise.It wasn't a great start.Today we have choices.We can make products that are beautiful or ugly,sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,functional or useless.So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,sustainable products.Let's take the LED.The LED is the next best thing to daylight.The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs --I'm not going to ask for a show of handsof how many of you still have them in your homes,wasting energy every time you switch them on --change them after this --or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not --but those old incandescent light bulbsreally should have been sold as heaters.They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.Now we have lights that produce lightand a little bit of heat on the side.You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LEDthat you would have done in an old incandescent.And the best thing is, they'll also lastfor more than 20 years.So think about that.You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,probably more if you're in this audience.You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.Your kids could go to school, go to college,go away and have kids of their own, come back,bring the grandkids,you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.So LEDs are fantastic.What we decided to dowas not to sell LEDs on the side marked up highand continue to push all the old bulbs,the halogens and the CFLs.We decided, over the next two years,we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.We will go all in.And this is what business needs to do: go all-in,go 100 percent,because then you stop investing in the old stuff,you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,you use your supply chain and your creativityand you get the prices down so everybody can affordthe best lights so they can save energy.(Applause)It's not just about products in people's homes.We've got to think about the raw materialsthat produce our products.Obviously there's fantastic opportunitieswith recycled materials,and we can and will go zero waste.And there's opportunities in a circular economy.But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.Let's take cotton.Cotton's brilliant. Probably many peopleare wearing cotton right now.It's a brilliant textile in use.It's really dirty in production.It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.So we've worked with others,with other businesses and NGOs,on the Better Cotton Initiative,working right back down to the farm,and there you can halve the amount of waterand halve the chemical inputs,the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costsof running many of these farmswith farmers with low incomescan be chemical imports.Yields increase, and you halve the input costs.Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.Already hundreds of thousands of farmershave been reached,and now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.Again, we're going all-in.By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.People sometimes think that100 percent's going to be hard,and we've had the conversation in the business.Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to dothan 90 percent or 50 percent.If you have a 90 percent target,everyone in the business finds a reasonto be in the 10 percent.When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear,and businesspeople like clarity,because then you just get the job done.So, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.You've got illegal loggingand deforestation still on a very large scale,or you can have fantastic, responsible forestrythat we can be proud of.It's a simple choice, so we've workedfor many years with the Forest Stewardship Council,with literally hundreds of other organizations,and there's a point here about collaboration.So hundreds of others, of NGOs,of forest workers' unions, and of businesses,have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council,which sets standards for forestryand then checks the forestry's good on the ground.Now together, through our supply chain,with partners, we've managed to certify35 million hectares of forestry.That's about the size of Germany.And we've decided in the next three years,we will double the volume of certified materialwe put through our business.So be decisive on these issues.Use your supply chain to drive good.But then it comes to your operations.Some things are certain, I think.We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.We know the sun will be shining somewhere,and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?And why not take control of it ourselves?So we're going 100 percent renewable.By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energythan the energy we consume as a business.For all of our stores, our own factories,our distribution centers,we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operatein six countries, and we're not done yet.But think of a solar panel.A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.The electricity is free.Every time the sun comes out after that,the electricity is free.So this is a good thing for the CFO,not just the sustainability guy.Every business can do things like this.But then we've got to look beyond our operations,and I think everybody would agreethat now business has to take full responsibilityfor the impacts of your supply chain.Many businesses now, fortunately,have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains,but not every business. Far from it.And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.We found there was a riskof child labor in the supply chain,and people in the business were shocked.And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.So a code of conduct was developed,and now we have 80 auditors out in the worldevery day making sure all our factoriessecure good working conditionsand protect human rightsand make sure there is no child labor.But it's not just as simple as making surethere's no child labor.You've got to say that's not enough today.I think we'd all agree that childrenare the most important people in the worldand the most vulnerable.So what can a business do todayto actually use your total value chainto support a better quality of lifeand protect child rights?We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Childrenon developing some new business principleswith children's rights.Increasing numbers of businessesare signing up to these,but actually in a survey, many business leaderssaid they thought their business had nothing to do with children.So what we decided to do was, we will lookand ask ourselves the tough questionswith partners who know more than us,what can we do to go beyond our businessto help improve the lives of children?We also have a foundationthat's committed to work through partnersand help improve the lives and protect the rightsof 100 million children by 2015.You know the phrase,you can manage what you measure?Well, you should measure what you care about.If you're not measuring things,you don't care and you don't know.So let's take an example, measure the thingsthat are important in your business.Isn't it about time that businesseswere led equally by men and women?(Applause)So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEAthat 47 percent are women today,but it's not enough, and we want to close the gapand follow it all the way through to senior management.And we do not want to wait another hundred years.So we've launched a women's open networkthis week in IKEA,and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.So the message here is,measure what you care about and lead the change,and don't wait a hundred years.So we've gone from sustainabilitybeing a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do.It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do.And everybody can do something on this as an individual.Be a discerning consumer.Vote with your wallets.Search out the companiesthat are acting on this.But also, there are other businesses already acting.I mentioned renewable energy.You go to Google or Lego,they're going 100 percent renewable too,in the same way that we are.On having really good sustainability strategies,there are companies like Nike, Patagonia,Timberland, Marks &amp; Spencer.But I don't think any of those businesses would saythey're perfect. We certainly wouldn't.We'll make mistakes going forward,but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent,having a dialogue with the right partners,and choosing to lead on the issues that really count.So if you're a business leader,if you're not already weaving sustainabilityright into the heart of your business model,I'd urge you to do so.And together, we can help createa sustainable world,and, if we get it right,we can make sustainabilityaffordable for the many people,not a luxury for the few.Thank you.(Applause)



alessandro_acquisti_why_privacy_matters

I would like to tell you a storyconnecting the notorious privacy incidentinvolving Adam and Eve,and the remarkable shift in the boundariesbetween public and private which has occurredin the past 10 years.You know the incident.Adam and Eve one day in the Garden of Edenrealize they are naked.They freak out.And the rest is history.Nowadays, Adam and Evewould probably act differently.[@Adam Last nite was a blast! loved dat apple LOL][@Eve yep.. babe, know what happened to my pants tho?]We do reveal so much more informationabout ourselves online than ever before,and so much information about usis being collected by organizations.Now there is much to gain and benefitfrom this massive analysis of personal information,or big data,but there are also complex tradeoffs that comefrom giving away our privacy.And my story is about these tradeoffs.We start with an observation which, in my mind,has become clearer and clearer in the past few years,that any personal informationcan become sensitive information.Back in the year 2000, about 100 billion photoswere shot worldwide,but only a minuscule proportion of themwere actually uploaded online.In 2010, only on Facebook, in a single month,2.5 billion photos were uploaded,most of them identified.In the same span of time,computers' ability to recognize people in photosimproved by three orders of magnitude.What happens when you combinethese technologies together:increasing availability of facial data;improving facial recognizing ability by computers;but also cloud computing,which gives anyone in this theaterthe kind of computational powerwhich a few years ago was only the domainof three-letter agencies;and ubiquitous computing,which allows my phone, which is not a supercomputer,to connect to the Internetand do there hundreds of thousandsof face metrics in a few seconds?Well, we conjecture that the resultof this combination of technologieswill be a radical change in our very notionsof privacy and anonymity.To test that, we did an experimenton Carnegie Mellon University campus.We asked students who were walking byto participate in a study,and we took a shot with a webcam,and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop.While they were filling out the survey,we uploaded their shot to a cloud-computing cluster,and we started using a facial recognizerto match that shot to a databaseof some hundreds of thousands of imageswhich we had downloaded from Facebook profiles.By the time the subject reached the last pageon the survey, the page had been dynamically updatedwith the 10 best matching photoswhich the recognizer had found,and we asked the subjects to indicatewhether he or she found themselves in the photo.Do you see the subject?Well, the computer did, and in fact did sofor one out of three subjects.So essentially, we can start from an anonymous face,offline or online, and we can use facial recognitionto give a name to that anonymous facethanks to social media data.But a few years back, we did something else.We started from social media data,we combined it statistically with datafrom U.S. government social security,and we ended up predicting social security numbers,which in the United Statesare extremely sensitive information.Do you see where I'm going with this?So if you combine the two studies together,then the question becomes,can you start from a face and,using facial recognition, find a nameand publicly available informationabout that name and that person,and from that publicly available informationinfer non-publicly available information,much more sensitive oneswhich you link back to the face?And the answer is, yes, we can, and we did.Of course, the accuracy keeps getting worse.[27% of subjects' first 5 SSN digits identified (with 4 attempts)]But in fact, we even decided to develop an iPhone appwhich uses the phone's internal camerato take a shot of a subjectand then upload it to a cloudand then do what I just described to you in real time:looking for a match, finding public information,trying to infer sensitive information,and then sending back to the phoneso that it is overlaid on the face of the subject,an example of augmented reality,probably a creepy example of augmented reality.In fact, we didn't develop the app to make it available,just as a proof of concept.In fact, take these technologiesand push them to their logical extreme.Imagine a future in which strangers around youwill look at you through their Google Glassesor, one day, their contact lenses,and use seven or eight data points about youto infer anything elsewhich may be known about you.What will this future without secrets look like?And should we care?We may like to believethat the future with so much wealth of datawould be a future with no more biases,but in fact, having so much informationdoesn't mean that we will make decisionswhich are more objective.In another experiment, we presented to our subjectsinformation about a potential job candidate.We included in this information some referencesto some funny, absolutely legal,but perhaps slightly embarrassing informationthat the subject had posted online.Now interestingly, among our subjects,some had posted comparable information,and some had not.Which group do you thinkwas more likely to judge harshly our subject?Paradoxically, it was the groupwho had posted similar information,an example of moral dissonance.Now you may be thinking,this does not apply to me,because I have nothing to hide.But in fact, privacy is not abouthaving something negative to hide.Imagine that you are the H.R. directorof a certain organization, and you receive résumés,and you decide to find more information about the candidates.Therefore, you Google their namesand in a certain universe,you find this information.Or in a parallel universe, you find this information.Do you think that you would be equally likelyto call either candidate for an interview?If you think so, then you are notlike the U.S. employers who are, in fact,part of our experiment, meaning we did exactly that.We created Facebook profiles, manipulating traits,then we started sending out résumés to companies in the U.S.,and we detected, we monitored,whether they were searching for our candidates,and whether they were acting on the informationthey found on social media. And they were.Discrimination was happening through social mediafor equally skilled candidates.Now marketers like us to believethat all information about us will alwaysbe used in a manner which is in our favor.But think again. Why should that be always the case?In a movie which came out a few years ago,"Minority Report," a famous scenehad Tom Cruise walk in a malland holographic personalized advertisingwould appear around him.Now, that movie is set in 2054,about 40 years from now,and as exciting as that technology looks,it already vastly underestimatesthe amount of information that organizationscan gather about you, and how they can use itto influence you in a way that you will not even detect.So as an example, this is another experimentactually we are running, not yet completed.Imagine that an organization has accessto your list of Facebook friends,and through some kind of algorithmthey can detect the two friends that you like the most.And then they create, in real time,a facial composite of these two friends.Now studies prior to ours have shown that peopledon't recognize any longer even themselvesin facial composites, but they reactto those composites in a positive manner.So next time you are looking for a certain product,and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it,it will not be just a standard spokesperson.It will be one of your friends,and you will not even know that this is happening.Now the problem is thatthe current policy mechanisms we haveto protect ourselves from the abuses of personal informationare like bringing a knife to a gunfight.One of these mechanisms is transparency,telling people what you are going to do with their data.And in principle, that's a very good thing.It's necessary, but it is not sufficient.Transparency can be misdirected.You can tell people what you are going to do,and then you still nudge them to disclosearbitrary amounts of personal information.So in yet another experiment, this one with students,we asked them to provide informationabout their campus behavior,including pretty sensitive questions, such as this one.[Have you ever cheated in an exam?]Now to one group of subjects, we told them,"Only other students will see your answers."To another group of subjects, we told them,"Students and faculty will see your answers."Transparency. Notification. And sure enough, this worked,in the sense that the first group of subjectswere much more likely to disclose than the second.It makes sense, right?But then we added the misdirection.We repeated the experiment with the same two groups,this time adding a delaybetween the time we told subjectshow we would use their dataand the time we actually started answering the questions.How long a delay do you think we had to addin order to nullify the inhibitory effectof knowing that faculty would see your answers?Ten minutes?Five minutes?One minute?How about 15 seconds?Fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groupsdisclose the same amount of information,as if the second group now no longer caresfor faculty reading their answers.Now I have to admit that this talk so farmay sound exceedingly gloomy,but that is not my point.In fact, I want to share with you the fact thatthere are alternatives.The way we are doing things now is not the only waythey can done, and certainly not the best waythey can be done.When someone tells you, "People don't care about privacy,"consider whether the game has been designedand rigged so that they cannot care about privacy,and coming to the realization that these manipulations occuris already halfway through the processof being able to protect yourself.When someone tells you that privacy is incompatiblewith the benefits of big data,consider that in the last 20 years,researchers have created technologiesto allow virtually any electronic transactionsto take place in a more privacy-preserving manner.We can browse the Internet anonymously.We can send emails that can only be readby the intended recipient, not even the NSA.We can have even privacy-preserving data mining.In other words, we can have the benefits of big datawhile protecting privacy.Of course, these technologies imply a shiftingof cost and revenuesbetween data holders and data subjects,which is why, perhaps, you don't hear more about them.Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden.There is a second privacy interpretationof the story of the Garden of Edenwhich doesn't have to do with the issueof Adam and Eve feeling nakedand feeling ashamed.You can find echoes of this interpretationin John Milton's "Paradise Lost."In the garden, Adam and Eve are materially content.They're happy. They are satisfied.However, they also lack knowledgeand self-awareness.The moment they eat the aptly namedfruit of knowledge,that's when they discover themselves.They become aware. They achieve autonomy.The price to pay, however, is leaving the garden.So privacy, in a way, is both the meansand the price to pay for freedom.Again, marketers tell usthat big data and social mediaare not just a paradise of profit for them,but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us.We get free content.We get to play Angry Birds. We get targeted apps.But in fact, in a few years, organizationswill know so much about us,they will be able to infer our desiresbefore we even form them, and perhapsbuy products on our behalfbefore we even know we need them.Now there was one English authorwho anticipated this kind of futurewhere we would trade awayour autonomy and freedom for comfort.Even more so than George Orwell,the author is, of course, Aldous Huxley.In "Brave New World," he imagines a societywhere technologies that we createdoriginally for freedomend up coercing us.However, in the book, he also offers us a way outof that society, similar to the paththat Adam and Eve had to follow to leave the garden.In the words of the Savage,regaining autonomy and freedom is possible,although the price to pay is steep.So I do believe that one of the defining fightsof our times will be the fightfor the control over personal information,the fight over whether big data will become a forcefor freedom,rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us.Right now, many of usdo not even know that the fight is going on,but it is, whether you like it or not.And at the risk of playing the serpent,I will tell you that the tools for the fightare here, the awareness of what is going on,and in your hands,just a few clicks away.Thank you.(Applause)

Here's a question we need to rethink together:What should be the role of moneyand markets in our societies?Today, there are very few thingsthat money can't buy.If you're sentenced to a jail termin Santa Barbara, California,you should knowthat if you don't like the standard accommodations,you can buy a prison cell upgrade.It's true. For how much, do you think?What would you guess?Five hundred dollars?It's not the Ritz-Carlton. It's a jail!Eighty-two dollars a night.Eighty-two dollars a night.If you go to an amusement parkand don't want to stand in the long linesfor the popular rides,there is now a solution.In many theme parks, you can pay extrato jump to the head of the line.They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets.And this isn't only happening in amusement parks.In Washington, D.C., long lines,queues sometimes formfor important Congressional hearings.Now some people don't like to wait in long queues,maybe overnight, even in the rain.So now, for lobbyists and otherswho are very keen to attend these hearingsbut don't like to wait, there are companies,line-standing companies,and you can go to them.You can pay them a certain amount of money,they hire homeless people and others who need a jobto stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes,and the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins,can take his or her place at the head of the lineand a seat in the front of the room.Paid line standing.It's happening, the recourse to market mechanismsand market thinking and market solutions,in bigger arenas.Take the way we fight our wars.Did you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan,there were more private military contractors on the groundthan there were U.S. military troops?Now this isn't because we had a public debateabout whether we wanted to outsource warto private companies,but this is what has happened.Over the past three decades,we have lived through a quiet revolution.We've drifted almost without realizing itfrom having a market economyto becoming market societies.The difference is this: A market economy is a tool,a valuable and effective tool,for organizing productive activity,but a market society is a place wherealmost everything is up for sale.It's a way of life, in which market thinkingand market values begin to dominateevery aspect of life:personal relations, family life, health, education,politics, law, civic life.Now, why worry? Why worry about our becomingmarket societies?For two reasons, I think.One of them has to do with inequality.The more things money can buy,the more affluence, or the lack of it, matters.If the only thing that money determinedwas access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs,then inequality wouldn't matter very much.But when money comes increasingly to governaccess to the essentials of the good life --decent health care, access to the best education,political voice and influence in campaigns --when money comes to govern all of those things,inequality matters a great deal.And so the marketization of everythingsharpens the sting of inequalityand its social and civic consequence.That's one reason to worry.There's a second reasonapart from the worry about inequality,and it's this:with some social goods and practices,when market thinking and market values enter,they may change the meaning of those practicesand crowd out attitudes and normsworth caring about.I'd like to take an exampleof a controversial use of a market mechanism,a cash incentive, and see what you think about it.Many schools struggle with the challengeof motivating kids, especially kidsfrom disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard,to do well in school, to apply themselves.Some economists have proposed a market solution:Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good gradesor high test scoresor for reading books.They've tried this, actually.They've done some experimentsin some major American cities.In New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C.,they've tried this, offering 50 dollars for an A,35 dollars for a B.In Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offerseight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read.So let's see what -- Some people are in favor,some people are opposed to this cash incentiveto motivate achievement.Let's see what people here think about it.Imagine that you are the head of a major school system,and someone comes to you with this proposal.And let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds.You don't have to take it out of your budget.How many would be in favorand how many would be opposed to giving it a try?Let's see by a show of hands.First, how many think it might at least be worth a tryto see if it would work? Raise your hand.And how many would be opposed? How many would --So the majority here are opposed,but a sizable minority are in favor.Let's have a discussion.Let's start with those of you who object,who would rule it out even before trying.What would be your reason?Who will get our discussion started? Yes?Heike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike,and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation,so in the respect that children, if they would like to read,you just take this incentive awayin just paying them, so it just changes behavior.Michael Sandel: Takes the intrinsic incentive away.What is, or should be, the intrinsic motivation?HM: Well, the intrinsic motivationshould be to learn.And then, if you stop paying them, what happens then?Then they stop reading?MS: Now, let's see if there's someone who favors,who thinks it's worth trying this.Elizabeth Loftus: I'm Elizabeth Loftus,and you said worth a try, so why not try itand do the experiment and measure things?MS: And measure. And what would you measure?You'd measure how many --EL: How many books they readand how many books they continued to readafter you stopped paying them.MS: Oh, after you stopped paying.All right, what about that?HM: To be frank, I just thinkthis is, not to offend anyone, a very American way.(Laughter) (Applause)MS: All right. What's emerged from this discussionis the following question:Will the cash incentive drive out or corruptor crowd out the higher motivation,the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey,which is to learn to love to learn and to readfor their own sakes?And people disagree about what the effect will be,but that seems to be the question,that somehow a market mechanismor a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson,and if it does, what will become of these children later?I should tell you what's happened with these experiments.The cash for good grades has had very mixed results,for the most part has not resulted in higher grades.The two dollars for each bookdid lead those kids to read more books.It also led them to read shorter books.(Laughter)But the real question is,what will become of these kids later?Will they have learned that reading is a chore,a form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry,or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initiallybut then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake?Now, what this, even this brief debate, brings outis something that many economists overlook.Economists often assumethat markets are inert,that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.Market exchange, they assume,doesn't change the meaning or valueof the goods being exchanged.This may be true enoughif we're talking about material goods.If you sell me a flat screen televisionor give me one as a gift,it will be the same good.It will work the same either way.But the same may not be trueif we're talking about nonmaterial goodsand social practices such as teaching and learningor engaging together in civic life.In those domains, bringing market mechanismsand cash incentives may undermineor crowd out nonmarket values and attitudesworth caring about.Once we seethat markets and commerce,when extended beyond the material domain,can change the character of the goods themselves,can change the meaning of the social practices,as in the example of teaching and learning,we have to ask where markets belongand where they don't,where they may actually underminevalues and attitudes worth caring about.But to have this debate,we have to do something we're not very good at,and that is to reason together in publicabout the value and the meaningof the social practices we prize,from our bodies to family lifeto personal relations to healthto teaching and learning to civic life.Now these are controversial questions,and so we tend to shrink from them.In fact, during the past three decades,when market reasoning and market thinkinghave gathered force and gained prestige,our public discourse during this timehas become hollowed out,empty of larger moral meaning.For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.But once we see that marketschange the character of goods,we have to debate among ourselvesthese bigger questionsabout how to value goods.One of the most corrosive effectsof putting a price on everythingis on commonality,the sense that we are all in it together.Against the background of rising inequality,marketizing every aspect of lifeleads to a condition where those who are affluentand those who are of modest meansincreasingly live separate lives.We live and work and shop and playin different places.Our children go to different schools.This isn't good for democracy,nor is it a satisfying way to live,even for those of us who can affordto buy our way to the head of the line.Here's why.Democracy does not require perfect equality,but what it does requireis that citizens share in a common life.What matters is that peopleof different social backgroundsand different walks of lifeencounter one another,bump up against one anotherin the ordinary course of life,because this is what teaches usto negotiate and to abide our differences.And this is how we come to care for the common good.And so, in the end, the question of marketsis not mainly an economic question.It's really a question of how we want to live together.Do we want a society where everything is up for sale,or are there certain moral and civic goodsthat markets do not honorand money cannot buy?Thank you very much.(Applause)

I think we're all awarethat the world today is full of problems.We've been hearing themtoday and yesterday and every day for decades.Serious problems, big problems, pressing problems.Poor nutrition, access to water,climate change, deforestation,lack of skills, insecurity, not enough food,not enough healthcare, pollution.There's problem after problem,and I think what really separates this timefrom any time I can remember in my brief timeon Earth is the awareness of these problems.We're all very aware.Why are we having so much troubledealing with these problems?That's the question I've been struggling with,coming from my very different perspective.I'm not a social problem guy.I'm a guy that works with business,helps business make money.God forbid.So why are we having so many problemswith these social problems,and really is there any role for business,and if so, what is that role?I think that in order to address that question,we have to step back and think abouthow we've understood and ponderedboth the problems and the solutionsto these great social challenges that we face.Now, I think many have seen businessas the problem, or at least one of the problems,in many of the social challenges we face.You know, think of the fast food industry,the drug industry, the banking industry.You know, this is a low pointin the respect for business.Business is not seen as the solution.It's seen as the problem now, for most people.And rightly so, in many cases.There's a lot of bad actors out therethat have done the wrong thing,that actually have made the problem worse.So this perspective is perhaps justified.How have we tended to see the solutionsto these social problems,these many issues that we face in society?Well, we've tended to see the solutionsin terms of NGOs,in terms of government,in terms of philanthropy.Indeed, the kind of unique organizational entityof this age is this tremendous rise of NGOsand social organizations.This is a unique, new organizational formthat we've seen grown up.Enormous innovation, enormous energy,enormous talent now has been mobilizedthrough this structureto try to deal with all of these challenges.And many of us here are deeply involved in that.I'm a business school professor,but I've actually founded, I think, now, four nonprofits.Whenever I got interested and became awareof a societal problem, that was what I did,form a nonprofit.That was the way we've thought about how to dealwith these issues.Even a business school professor has thought about it that way.But I think at this moment,we've been at this for quite a while.We've been aware of these problems for decades.We have decades of experiencewith our NGOs and with our government entities,and there's an awkward reality.The awkward reality is we're not makingfast enough progress.We're not winning.These problems still seem very dauntingand very intractable,and any solutions we're achievingare small solutions.We're making incremental progress.What's the fundamental problem we havein dealing with these social problems?If we cut all the complexity away,we have the problem of scale.We can't scale.We can make progress. We can show benefits.We can show results. We can make things better.We're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good.We can't scale.We can't make a large-scale impact on these problems.Why is that?Because we don't have the resources.And that's really clear now.And that's clearer now than it's been for decades.There's simply not enough moneyto deal with any of these problems at scaleusing the current model.There's not enough tax revenue,there's not enough philanthropic donations,to deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now.We've got to confront that reality.And the scarcity of resourcesfor dealing with these problems is only growing,certainly in the advanced world today,with all the fiscal problems we face.So if it's fundamentally a resource problem,where are the resources in society?How are those resources really created,the resources we're going to need to dealwith all these societal challenges?Well there, I think the answer is very clear:They're in business.All wealth is actually created by business.Business creates wealthwhen it meets needs at a profit.That's how all wealth is created.It's meeting needs at a profitthat leads to taxesand that leads to incomesand that leads to charitable donations.That's where all the resources come from.Only business can actually create resources.Other institutions can utilize themto do important work,but only business can create them.And business creates themwhen it's able to meet a need at a profit.The resources are overwhelminglygenerated by business.The question then is, how do we tap into this?How do we tap into this?Business generates those resourceswhen it makes a profit.That profit is that small differencebetween the price and the cost it takes to producewhatever solution business has createdto whatever problem they're trying to solve.But that profit is the magic.Why? Because that profit allows whatever solutionwe've createdto be infinitely scalable.Because if we can make a profit,we can do it for 10, 100, a million,100 million, a billion.The solution becomes self-sustaining.That's what business doeswhen it makes a profit.Now what does this all have to dowith social problems?Well, one line of thinking is, let's take this profitand redeploy it into social problems.Business should give more.Business should be more responsible.And that's been the path that we've been onin business.But again, this path that we've been onis not getting us where we need to go.Now, I started out as a strategy professor,and I'm still a strategy professor.I'm proud of that.But I've also, over the years,worked more and more on social issues.I've worked on healthcare, the environment,economic development, reducing poverty,and as I worked more and more in the social field,I started seeing somethingthat had a profound impact on meand my whole life, in a way.The conventional wisdom in economicsand the view in business has historically beenthat actually, there's a tradeoffbetween social performance and economic performance.The conventional wisdom has beenthat business actually makes a profitby causing a social problem.The classic example is pollution.If business pollutes, it makes more moneythan if it tried to reduce that pollution.Reducing pollution is expensive,therefore businesses don't want to do it.It's profitable to have an unsafe working environment.It's too expensive to have a safe working environment,therefore business makes more moneyif they don't have a safe working environment.That's been the conventional wisdom.A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom.They resisted environmental improvement.They resisted workplace improvement.That thinking has led to, I think,much of the behaviorthat we have come to criticize in business,that I come to criticize in business.But the more deeply I got into all these social issues,one after another,and actually, the more I tried to address themmyself, personally, in a few cases,through nonprofits that I was involved with,the more I found actually that the realityis the opposite.Business does not profitfrom causing social problems,actually not in any fundamental sense.That's a very simplistic view.The deeper we get into these issues,the more we start to understandthat actually business profitsfrom solving from social problems.That's where the real profit comes.Let's take pollution.We've learned today that actuallyreducing pollution and emissionsis generating profit.It saves money.It makes the business more productive and efficient.It doesn't waste resources.Having a safer working environment actually,and avoiding accidents,it makes the business more profitable,because it's a sign of good processes.Accidents are expensive and costly.Issue by issue by issue, we start to learnthat actually there's no trade-offbetween social progressand economic efficiencyin any fundamental sense.Another issue is health.I mean, what we've found is actuallyhealth of employees is somethingthat business should treasure,because that health allows those employeesto be more productive and come to workand not be absent.The deeper work, the new work, the new thinkingon the interface between business and social problemsis actually showing that there's a fundamental,deep synergy,particularly if you're not thinking in the very short run.In the very short run, you can sometimesfool yourself into thinkingthat there's fundamentally opposing goals,but in the long run, ultimately, we're learningin field after field that this is simply not true.So how could we tap intothe power of businessto address the fundamental problemsthat we face?Imagine if we could do that, because if we could do it,we could scale.We could tap into this enormous resource pooland this organizational capacity.And guess what? That's happening now, finally,partly because of people like youwho have raised these issues nowfor year after year and decade after decade.We see organizations like Dow Chemicalleading the revolution away from trans fatand saturated fat with innovative new products.This is an example of Jain Irrigation.This is a company that's brought drip irrigation technologyto thousands and millions of farmers,reducing substantially the use of water.We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibriathat's figured out how to avoidtearing down old growth forestand using eucalyptus and getting much more yieldper hectare of pulpand making much more paper than you could makeby cutting down those old trees.You see companies like Cisco that are trainingso far four million people in I.T. skillsto actually, yes, be responsible,but help expand the opportunityto disseminate I.T. technologyand grow the whole business.There's a fundamental opportunity for business todayto impact and address these social problems,and this opportunityis the largest business opportunitywe see in business.And the question is, how can we get businessthinking to adapt this issue of shared value?This is what I call shared value:addressing a social issue with a business model.That's shared value.Shared value is capitalism,but it's a higher kind of capitalism.It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be,meeting important needs,not incrementally competing fortrivial differences in product attributesand market share.Shared value is when we can create social valueand economic value simultaneously.It's finding those opportunitiesthat will unleash the greatest possibility we haveto actually address these social problemsbecause we can scale.We can address shared value at multiple levels.It's real. It's happening.But in order to get this solution working,we have to now change how business sees itself,and this is thankfully underway.Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdomthat they shouldn't worry about social problems,that this was sort of something on the side,that somebody else was doing it.We're now seeing companiesembrace this idea.But we also have to recognize businessis not going to do this as effectivelyas if we have NGOs and governmentworking in partnership with business.The new NGOs that are really moving the needleare the ones that have found these partnerships,that have found these ways to collaborate.The governments that are making the most progressare the governments that have found waysto enable shared value in businessrather than see government as the only playerthat has to call the shots.And government has many ways in which it could impactthe willingness and the ability of companiesto compete in this way.I think if we can get business seeing itself differently,and if we can get others seeing business differently,we can change the world.I know it. I'm seeing it.I'm feeling it.Young people, I think,my Harvard Business School students, are getting it.If we can break down this sort of divide,this unease, this tension,this sense that we're notfundamentally collaborating herein driving these social problems,we can break this down,and we finally, I think,can have solutions.Thank you.(Applause)

So here's the most important economic fact of our time.We are living in an age of surging income inequality,particularly between those at the very topand everyone else.This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.,but it's a global phenomenon.It's happening in communist China,in formerly communist Russia,it's happening in India, in my own native Canada.We're even seeing it in cozy social democracieslike Sweden, Finland and Germany.Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening.In the 1970s, the One Percentaccounted for about 10 percent of the national incomein the United States.Today, their share has more than doubledto above 20 percent.But what's even more strikingis what's happening at the very tippy topof the income distribution.The 0.1 percent in the U.S.today account for more than eight percentof the national income.They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago.Let me give you another number to put that in perspective,and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005by Robert Reich,the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men,Bill Gates and Warren Buffett,and he found that it was equivalent to the wealthof the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population,120 million people.Now, as it happens,Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat,he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon,and he has his own favorite number.Buffett likes to point out that in 1992,the combined wealth of the peopleon the Forbes 400 list --and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans --was 300 billion dollars.Just think about it.You didn't even need to be a billionaireto get on that list in 1992.Well, today, that figure has more than quintupledto 1.7 trillion,and I probably don't need to tell youthat we haven't seen anything similar happento the middle class,whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased.So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy,but we've been slow to notice it.One of the reasons, I think,is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon.Changes which are slow and gradualcan be hard to noticeeven if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic.Think about what happened, after all, to the poor frog.But I think there's something else going on.Talking about income inequality,even if you're not on the Forbes 400 list,can make us feel uncomfortable.It feels less positive, less optimistic,to talk about how the pie is slicedthan to think about how to make the pie bigger.And if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list,talking about income distribution,and inevitably its cousin, income redistribution,can be downright threatening.So we're living in the age of surging income inequality,especially at the top.What's driving it, and what can we do about it?One set of causes is political:lower taxes, deregulation, particularly of financial services,privatization, weaker legal protections for trade unions,all of these have contributedto more and more income going to the very, very top.A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumpedunder the category of "crony capitalism,"political changes that benefit a groupof well-connected insidersbut don't actually do much good for the rest of us.In practice, getting rid of crony capitalismis incredibly difficult.Think of all the years reformers of various stripeshave tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance,or how hard it is to re-regulate the bankseven after the most profound financial crisissince the Great Depression,or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies,including those whose motto might be "don't do evil,"to pay taxes at a rate even approaching thatpaid by the middle class.But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practiceis really, really hard,at least intellectually, it's an easy problem.After all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism.Indeed, this is one of those rare issuesthat unites the left and the right.A critique of crony capitalism is as centralto the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street.But if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least,the easy part of the problem,things get trickier when you look at the economic driversof surging income inequality.In and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious.Globalization and the technology revolution,the twin economic transformationswhich are changing our livesand transforming the global economy,are also powering the rise of the super-rich.Just think about it.For the first time in history,if you are an energetic entrepreneurwith a brilliant new ideaor a fantastic new product,you have almost instant, almost frictionless accessto a global market of more than a billion people.As a result, if you are very, very smartand very, very lucky,you can get very, very richvery, very quickly.The latest poster boy for this phenomenonis David Karp.The 26-year-old founder of Tumblrrecently sold his company to Yahoofor 1.1 billion dollars.Think about that for a minute:1.1 billion dollars, 26 years old.It's easiest to see how the technology revolutionand globalization are creating this sort of superstar effectin highly visible fields,like sports and entertainment.We can all watch how a fantastic athleteor a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skillsacross the global economy as never before.But today, that superstar effectis happening across the entire economy.We have superstar technologists.We have superstar bankers.We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects.There are superstar cooksand superstar farmers.There are even, and this is my personal favorite example,superstar dentists,the most dazzling exemplar of whomis Bernard Touati, the Frenchman who ministersto the smiles of fellow superstarslike Russian oligarch Roman Abramovichor European-born American fashion designerDiane von Furstenberg.But while it's pretty easy to see how globalizationand the technology revolutionare creating this global plutocracy,what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it.And that's because,in contrast with crony capitalism,so much of what globalization and the technology revolutionhave done is highly positive.Let's start with technology.I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices.I love the fact that they mean thatwhoever chooses to will be able to watch this talkfar beyond this auditorium.I'm even more of a fan of globalization.This is the transformationwhich has lifted hundreds of millionsof the world's poorest people out of povertyand into the middle class,and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world,it's made many new products affordable --who do you think built your iPhone? —and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper.Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt.So what's not to like?Well, a few things.One of the things that worries meis how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracycan become crony plutocracy.Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneurwho has successfully sold that idea or that productto the global billionsand become a billionaire in the process.It gets tempting at that pointto use your economic nousto manipulate the rules of the global political economyin your own favor.And that's no mere hypothetical example.Think about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks.These are among the world's most admired,most beloved, most innovative companies.They also happen to be particularly adeptat working the international tax systemso as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.And why stop at just playing the global politicaland economic system as it existsto your own maximum advantage?Once you have the tremendous economic powerthat we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distributionand the political power that inevitably entails,it becomes tempting as wellto start trying to change the rules of the gamein your own favor.Again, this is no mere hypothetical.It's what the Russian oligarchs didin creating the sale-of-the-century privatizationof Russia's natural resources.It's one way of describing what happenedwith deregulation of the financial servicesin the U.S. and the U.K.A second thing that worries meis how easily meritocratic plutocracycan become aristocracy.One way of describing the plutocratsis as alpha geeks,and they are people who are acutely awareof how important highly sophisticatedanalytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy.That's why they are spendingunprecedented time and resourceseducating their own children.The middle class is spending more on schooling too,but in the global educational arms racethat starts at nursery schooland ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT,the 99 percent is increasingly outgunnedby the One Percent.The result is something that economists Alan Kruegerand Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve.As income inequality increases,social mobility decreases.The plutocracy may be a meritocracy,but increasingly you have to be bornon the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race.The third thing, and this is what worries me the most,is the extent to which those same largely positive forceswhich are driving the rise of the global plutocracyalso happen to be hollowing out the middle classin Western industrialized economies.Let's start with technology.Those same forces that are creating billionairesare also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs.When's the last time you used a travel agent?And in contrast with the industrial revolution,the titans of our new economyaren't creating that many new jobs.At its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands,Facebook fewer than 10,000.The same is true of globalization.For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of peopleout of poverty in the emerging markets,it's also outsourcing a lot of jobsfrom the developed Western economies.The terrifying reality isthat there is no economic rulewhich automatically translatesincreased economic growthinto widely shared prosperity.That's shown in what I consider to bethe most scary economic statistic of our time.Since the late 1990s, increases in productivityhave been decoupled from increasesin wages and employment.That means that our countries are getting richer,our companies are getting more efficient,but we're not creating more jobsand we're not paying people, as a whole, more.One scary conclusion you could draw from all of thisis to worry about structural unemployment.What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario.After all, in a totally free labor market,we could find jobs for pretty much everyone.The dystopia that worries meis a universe in which a few geniusesinvent Google and its ilkand the rest of us are employed giving them massages.So when I get really depressed about all of this,I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution.After all, for all its grim, satanic mills,it worked out pretty well, didn't it?After all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller --well, there are a few exceptions —and live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century.But it's important to rememberthat before we learned how to share the fruitsof the Industrial Revolutionwith the broad swathes of society,we had to go through two depressions,the Great Depression of the 1930s,the Long Depression of the 1870s,two world wars, communist revolutionsin Russia and in China,and an era of tremendous socialand political upheaval in the West.We also, not coincidentally,went through an era of tremendoussocial and political inventions.We created the modern welfare state.We created public education.We created public health care.We created public pensions.We created unions.Today, we are living through an eraof economic transformationcomparable in its scale and its scopeto the Industrial Revolution.To be sure that this new economy benefits us alland not just the plutocrats,we need to embark on an eraof comparably ambitious social and political change.We need a new New Deal.(Applause)

So if I was to ask youwhat the connection betweena bottle of Tide detergent and sweat was,of alternative or new forms of currencyBut trust me, I work in advertising.(Laughter)And I am going to tell you the answer,but obviously after this short break.So a more challenging question is oneIt's actually Bitcoin.using a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.No one knows who or what he is.And the Bitcoins are released,It's actually managed by the network.And it's currently around that kind of110 dollar mark in value.it's gaining respectability.And that's showing you that peopleare actually placing trust in technology,and it's started to trump and disruptand interrogate traditional institutionsthe basket case that is the E.U.that said something like, in America,to sort of lose faith in institutions.There's a P.R. company called Edelman,hierarchy is having a bit of a wobble,and it's all about heterarchical now,And I find that sort of scary.and do it more easily,it makes it much easiersuddenly start to make a bit more sense.So if you think we're starting to questionthen the ultimate extension of that is,of money anymore?so from a brand perspective,You know, reputations are built on trust,consistency, transparency.of currency.So you think about loyalty.Loyalty essentially is a micro-economy.The Economist said a few years ago thatSo that's a sort of Starbucks currencystaying within its ecosystem.And what I find interesting is that Amazonhas recently launched Amazon coins.but you think about Amazon,more than governments.So suddenly, you start thinking,well Amazon potentially could push this.It could become a natural extension,that as well as buying stuff --what money is, what constitutes money.as I promised.are actually purchasing drugswith bottles of Tide detergent.So they're going into convenience stores,stealing Tide,and a $20 bottle of TideTide as a product sells at a premium.and, being a Procter and Gamble brand,When they spot Tide, there's a shortcut.So it becomes this unit of currency,which the New York Magazine describedfrom the P&amp;G spokesperson.but said, "It reminds me of one thingbreak a sweat when he said that.called, literally, Bid Your Sweat.So you think about,these Nike shoes have got sensors in them,or you're using a Nike FuelBandyour calorie consumption.for the community that are sweatingIn Africa, you know, airtime has becomeliterally a currency in its own right.making payments via mobile.going on is Vodafone, where, in Egypt,lots of people make purchases in marketsand very small independent stores.you're due, say,10 cents, 20 cents in change.or an aspirin, or a piece of gum,because they don't have small change.this consumer pain point, they createdsome small change which they call Fakka,which literally sits and is givenby the shopkeepers to people,is really, really interesting.you know, 45 percent of peoplewere saying that they're comfortable usingan independent or branded currency.So that's getting really interesting here,a really interesting dynamic going on.And you think, corporationsin a different way and trading them.And you think, is it much of a leap?in America in 1860,And the only thing that stopped that,and the only thing that stopped itwas the Civil War breaking out,So what I'm going to ask is, basically,is history repeating itself?using TED florins or TED shillings?Thank you very much.(Applause)Thank you.

charmian_gooch_meet_global_corruption_s_hidden_players
1510960

When we talk about corruption,There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs.Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them.Until his death in 2006,And one renamed the months of the yearincluding after himself and his mother.He spent millions of dollarscreating a bizarre personality cult,and his crowning glory was the buildingand rotated to follow the sun.He was a slightly unusual guy.And then there's that cliché,There's Teodorín Obiang.a West African nation that has exportedbillions of dollars of oil since the 1990sThe vast majority of its peopleare living in really miserable povertywith that of Portugal.So Obiang junior, well, he buys himselfI've been up to its front gates.I can tell you it's a magnificent spread.He bought an €18 million art collectiona stack of fabulous sports cars,some costing a million dollars apiece --oh, and a Gulfstream jet, too.Now get this:of less than 7,000 dollars.And there's Dan Etete.under President Abacha,We've spent a great deal of timeinvestigating a $1 billion --that's right, a $1 billion —oil deal that he was involved with,and what we found was pretty shocking,but more about that later.somewhere over there,carried out by a bunch of greedy despotsand individuals up to no good in countriesand feel really unconnected toand unaffected by what might be going on.But does it just happen over there?Well, at 22, I was very lucky.My first job out of universitySimon Taylor and Patrick Alley,So a few years later, and it's now 1997,Perhaps you saw the film,the Hollywood film "Blood Diamond,"the one with Leonardo DiCaprio.Well, some of that sprang from our work.Luanda, it was full of land mine victimsand a tiny, very wealthy eliteAnd it was a slightly crazy place.feeling just totally overwhelmed.But it wasn't about blood diamonds.and millions of oil dollars going missing.of just a few people,was an enormous challenge.And in the years that I've been,on a global, massive scale possible,or that nebulous phrase "weak governance."I mean, yes, it's all of those,of global facilitators.Take Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end upHe did business with global banks.one of which was used to buy the art,and American banks, well, they funneled73 million dollars into the States,He used shell companies.which was in somebody else's name,And then there's Dan Etete.Well, when he was oil minister,to a company that, guess what, yeah,he was the hidden owner of.Now, it was then much later traded onnow I have to be careful what I say here —two of the biggest oil companies around.This engine, well, it's drivenby our international banking system,and by the secrecy that we have affordedbig oil, gas and mining operations,to back up their rhetoric and do somethingNow let's take the banks first.For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.Now this region, it has just five percentof its forests left intact. Five percent.So how did that happen?have been making millions of dollarsfor many years.So we sent an undercover investigator inand you can see that on YouTube,but it proved what we had long suspected,despite his later denials,to enrich himself and his family.the region's largest logging companiesin Sarawak and elsewhere.but it earned around 130 million dollars.Now shortly after our exposé,And is this progress? Maybe,on that case.and we all know they're used quite a bitpaying their proper dues to society,also known as taxes.But what doesn't usually come to lightis how shell companies are used to stealfrom poor countries.shell companies have appeared,who is really involved in the deal.A recent study by the World Banklooked at 200 cases of corruption.had used anonymous shell companies,totaling almost 56 billion dollars.or the United Kingdom,and so it's not just an offshore problem,it's an on-shore one too.You see, shell companies, they're centralrather than ordinary citizens.So we spoke to sources in country,had quickly flipped many of the assets onlisted in London.That's almost twiceWell, the answer to that question,Corruption in that sector, no surprise.Well, because there's a lot at stake.In 2011, natural resource exportsoutweighed aid flows by almost 19 to oneand hospitals and business startups,have been through this in some detailand they want me to get it right.Subsidiaries of Shell and EniThe Nigerian government transferredwhose hidden owner was Etete.And here's the thing.After many months of digging aroundwe found evidence that, in fact,Shell and Eni had known that the fundswho they were really dealing with there.I mean, these are state assets.of the people in the country.who are trying to expose stories like thishave been harassed and arrestedthat corruption is unavoidable.It's just how some business is done.It's too complex and difficult to change.So in effect, what? We just accept it.But as a campaigner and investigator,I have a different view,because I've seen what can happenwhen an idea gains momentum.In the oil and mining sector, for example,there is now the beginningof a truly worldwide transparency standardthat could tackle some of these problems.In 1999, when Global Witness calledof that small idea.from around the world came togetherto fight for transparency,Two thirds of the valueof the world's oil and mining companiesSo this is change happening.This is progress.But we're not there yet, by far.Because it really isn't about corruptionsomewhere over there, is it?In a globalized world, corruptionis a truly globalized business,and one that needs global solutions,right here.Thank you.(Applause)

Good morning.My name is Eric Li, and I was born here.But no, I wasn't born there.This was where I was born:My grandmother tells me that she heardWhen I was growing up, I was told a storyIt went like this.feudalism, capitalism, socialism,and finally, guess where we end up?Communism!Sooner or later, all of humanity,will arrive at this final stageof political and social development.The entire world's peoples will be unifiedin this paradise on Earthand live happily ever after.But before we get there, we're engagedin a struggle between good and evil,and the good shall triumph.That, of course, was the meta-narrativedistilled from the theories of Karl Marx.And the Chinese bought it.The story was a bestseller.lived under that meta-narrative.Then, the world changed overnight.(Laughter)As if one big story wasn't enough,I was told another one.This one was just as grand.It also claims that all human societiesThis one went as follows:All societies, regardless of culture,be it Christian, Muslim, Confucian,must progress from traditional societiesin which groups are the basic unitsare the sovereign units,and they all want one thing:the vote.they produce good governmentand live happily ever after.Paradise on Earth, again.with a free market to make them all rich.between good and evil.(Laughter)around the globe, sometimes by force,who would hold power.Eric X. Li: Now --(Laughter) (Applause)This story also became a bestseller.According to Freedom House,to 115 in 2010.Multiple parties fight for political powerand everyone voting on themis the only path to salvationto the long-suffering developing world.Those who do not are doomed to fail.But this time, the Chinese didn't buy it.Fool me once...(Laughter)The rest is history.In just 30 years, China went fromto its second-largest economy.Six hundred fifty million peoplewere lifted out of poverty.during that period happened in China.put together amounted to a mere fractionSee, I grew up on this stuff: food stamps.Meat was rationed to a few hundred gramsper person per month at one point.Here I am in my hometown,my business growing leaps and bounds.unprecedented in human history.Yet, according to the grand story,none of this should be happening.Yes, China is a one-party stateand they don't hold elections.Three assumptions are madeSuch a system is operationally rigid,Well, the assumptions are wrong.The opposites are true.Adaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacyare the three defining characteristicsof China's one-party system.of self-correction.Now here are the facts.than any other country in recent memory,then privatization of farmland,then the Cultural Revolution,then Deng Xiaoping's market reform,something unimaginable during Mao's rule.Institutionally, new rules get enactedto correct previous dysfunctions.For example, term limits.and they used that to accumulate powerand perpetuate their rules.Mao was the father of modern China,So the Party instituted term limitswith mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70.One thing we often hear is,But this claim is a rhetorical traphidden behind a political bias.See, some have decided a prioriwhat kinds of changes they want to see,every aspect of Chinese society,how the country is governed,are unrecognizable today.Now such changes are simply not possibleNow I would venture to suggest the Partyand bad governance and corruption follow.Indeed, corruption is a big problem,Now, this may be counterintuitive to you.political institutions in the world today.In the most recent one, only five of themcame from entirely ordinary backgrounds.the percentage of those who were borninto power and wealth was even smaller.worked and competed their way to the top.Compare that with the ruling elitesin upward mobility.in a system run by one party?little-known to Westerners:the Party's Organization Department.The department functions like a giantIt operates a rotating pyramidmade up of three components:civil service, state-owned enterprises,and social organizations like a universityor a community program.for Chinese officials.called "keyuan" [clerk].Then they could get promotedthrough four increasingly elite ranks:It's serious business.The range of positions is wide,from running health care in a villageto foreign investment in a city districtto manager in a company.They conduct public opinion surveys.Then they promote the winners.Throughout their careers, these cadresThere, they enter high officialdom.600,000 fuchu and chu levels,and only 40,000 fuju and ju levels.After the ju levels,The process takes two to three decades.But merit remains the fundamental driver.mentoring system.China's new president, Xi Jinping,first of his kind to make the top job.Even for him, the career took 30 years.He started as a village manager,and by the time he entered the Politburo,of 150 million peopleNow, please don't get me wrong, okay?George W. Bush, remember him?This is not a put-down.(Laughter)Before becoming governor of Texas,could not make even a small county managerin China's system.Winston Churchill once said that democracyNow, Westerners always assume thatWhere is the source of legitimacy?"I said, "How about competency?"We all know the facts.In 1949, when the Party took power,in increasing prosperity.and here are the numbers in recent years.70 percent.Those who expect the future to be better:a whopping 82 percent.are suffering from dismal performance.With a few exceptions, the vast numberbelow 50 percent approval in a few monthsDemocracy is becoming a perpetual cycleof elect and regret.At this rate, I'm afraid it is democracy,of losing legitimacy.that China's hunky-dory, on the wayto some kind of superpowerdom.The country faces enormous challenges.The social and economic problems that comeand its moral legitimacy.But most analysts misdiagnose the disease.and therefore, in order to cure it,Transparency International ranks Chinaand it's been moving up.India, the largest democracy in the world,94 and dropping.how come these countries can't fix it?So here they are.Income per capita will be near the topof all developing countries.and China will move up 10 to 20 notchesto above 60 in T.I. ranking.and the one-party system will hold firm.We live in the dusk of an era.Meta-narratives that make universal claimsfailed us in the 20th centuryand are failing us in the 21st.Meta-narrative is the cancerthat is killing democracy from the inside.Now, I want to clarify something.on trying to force their way onto others,it doesn't pretend to be universal.The significance of China's exampleis not that it provides an alternative,there's only one way to govern ourselvesand a singular future towards whichall societies must evolve.It is wrong. It is irresponsible.And worst of all, it is boring.Let universality make way for plurality.Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us.Are we brave enough to welcome it?Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.decides what the national interest is.What is the mechanism in the Chinese modelthat allows people to say, actually,in China, okay?Do you know who their biggest client is?The Chinese government.Not just from the central government,to the most local neighborhood districts.They conduct surveys all the time.Are you happy with the garbage collection?My point is, I think we should get unstuckelection, election, election --that could make it responsive.I'm not sure, actually, elections produce(Applause)BG: Many seem to agree.One of the features of a democratic systemtens of thousands of unrests and protestsand environmental protests, etc.So you seem to suggest the Chinese modeldoesn't have a space outside of the Partyfor civil society to express itself.whether it's environment or what-have-you.has to be separate or even in oppositionto the political system,yet they are consistent and coherentand part of a political order, and I thinkit's a big cultural difference.



juliana_rotich_meet_brck_internet_access_built_for_africa
616447

Living in Africa is to be on the edge,metaphorically, and quite literallywhen you think about connectivity before 2008.Though many human intellectual and technological leapshad happened in Europe and the rest of the world,but Africa was sort of cut off.And that changed, first with shipswhen we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolutionand also the Industrial Revolution.And now we've got the digital revolution.These revolutions have not been evenly distributedacross continents and nations.Never have been.Now, this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cablesthat connect Africa to the rest of the world.What I find amazing is that Africais transcending its geography problem.Africa is connecting to the rest of the worldand within itself.The connectivity situation has improved greatly,but some barriers remain.It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be.In 2008, one of the problems that we facedwas lack of information flow.There was a media blackout in 2008,when there was post-election violence in Kenya.It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time.So we came together and we created softwarecalled Ushahidi.And Ushahidi means "testimony" or "witness" in Swahili.I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators.This is David and Erik.I call them brothers from another mother.Clearly I have a German mother somewhere.And we worked together first with buildingand growing Ushahidi.And the idea of the software was to gather informationfrom SMS, email and web, and put a mapso that you could see what was happening where,and you could visualize that data.And after that initial prototype,we set out to make free and open-source softwareso that others do not have to start from scratch like we did.All the while, we also wanted to give backto the local tech community that helped usgrow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi,an actual physical spacewhere we could collaborate,and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya.We did that with the support of different organizationslike the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network.And we were able to grow this software footprint,and a few years later it becamevery useful software,and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haitiwhere citizens could indicate where they areand what their needs were,and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisisand the tsunami in Japan.Now, this year the Internet turns 20,and Ushahidi turned five.Ushahidi is not only the software that we made.It is the team, and it's also the communitythat uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee.We did not imagine that there would be this many mapsaround the world.There are crisis maps, election maps, corruption maps,and even environmental monitoring crowd maps.We are humbled that this has roots in Kenyaand that it has some use to people around the worldtrying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with.There is more that we're doing to explore this ideaof collective intelligence, that I, as a citizen,if I share the information with whatever device that I have,could inform you about what is going on,and that if you do the same, we can have a bigger pictureof what's going on.I moved back to Kenya in 2011.Erik moved in 2010.Very different reality. I used to live in Chicagowhere there was abundant Internet access.I had never had to deal with a blackout.And in Kenya, it's a very different reality,and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progressand the digital revolution is the electricity problem.The day-to-day frustrations of dealing with thiscan be, let's just say very annoying.Blackouts are not fun.Imagine sitting down to start working, and all of a suddenthe power goes out,your Internet connection goes down with it,so you have to figure out, okay, now, where's the modem,how do I switch back?And then, guess what? You have to deal with it again.Now, this is the reality of Kenya, where we live now,and other parts of Africa.The other problem that we're facingis that communication costs are also still a challenge.It costs me five Kenyan shillings,or .06 USD to call the U.S., Canada or China.Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria?Thirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the costto connect within Africa.And also, when traveling within Africa,you've got different settings for different mobile providers.This is the reality that we deal with.So we've got a joke in Ushahidiwhere we say, "If it works in Africa, it'll work anywhere."[Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.]What if we could overcome the problemof unreliable Internet and electricityand reduce the cost of connection?Could we leverage the cloud?We've built a crowd map, we've built Ushahidi.Could we leverage these technologiesto switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country?So we looked at the modem,an important part of the infrastructure of the Internet,and asked ourselves whythe modems that we are using right noware built for a different context, where you've gotubiquitous internet, you've got ubiquitous electricity,yet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury.We wanted to redesign the modemfor the developing world, for our context,and for our reality.What if we could have connectivity with less friction?This is the BRCK.It acts as a backup to the Internetso that, when the power goes out,it fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network.Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive.It's actually everywhere.Most towns at least have a 3G connection.So why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this.The other reason that we built thisis when electricity goes down, this has eight hoursof battery left, so you can continue working,you can continue being productive,and let's just say you are less stressed.And for rural areas, it can bethe primary means of connection.The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at playwhen we wondered how can we use the cloudto be more intelligent so thatyou can analyze the different networks,and whenever you switch on the backup,you pick on the fastest network,so we'll have multi-SIM capabilityso that you can put multiple SIMs,and if one network is faster, that's the one you hop on,and if the up time on that is not very good,then you hop onto the next one.The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere.With load balancing, this can be possible.The other interesting thing for us -- we like sensors --is this idea that you could have an on-rampfor the Internet of things.Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this.It's built in a modular way so that you can also attacha satellite module so that you could haveInternet connectivity even in very remote areas.Out of adversity can come innovation,and how can we help the ambitious coders and makersin Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure?And for us, we begin with solving the problemin our own backyard in Kenya.It is not without challenge.Our team has basically been mules carrying componentsfrom the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversationswith customs border agents."What are you carrying?"And the local financing is notpart of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects.So we put it on Kickstarter, and I'm happy to say that,through the support of many people,not only here but online,the BRCK has been Kickstarted,and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins.I will close by saying that, if we solve thisfor the local market, it could be impactfulnot only for the coders in Nairobibut also for small business ownerswho need reliable connectivity,and it can reduce the cost of connecting,and hopefully collaboration within African countries.The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economyare connectivity and entrepreneurship.The BRCK is our partto keep Africans connected,and to help them drive the global digital revolution.Thank you.(Applause)



didier_sornette_how_we_can_predict_the_next_financial_crisis
1289213

Once upon a timewe lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity.This was called the Great Moderation,the misguided belief by most economists,policymakers and central banksthat we have transformed into a new worldof never-ending growth and prosperity.This was seen by robust and steady GDP growth,by low and controlled inflation,by low unemployment,and controlled and low financial volatility.But the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008,the great crash, broke this illusion.A few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sectorcascaded into five trillion dollarsof losses in world GDPand almost $30 trillion lossesin the global stock market.So the understanding of this Great Recessionwas that this was completely surprising,this came out of the blue,this was like the wrath of the gods.There was no responsibility.So, as a reflection of this,we started the Financial Crisis Observatory.We had the goal to diagnose in real timefinancial bubblesand identify in advance their critical time.What is the underpinning, scientifically, of this financial observatory?We developed a theory called "dragon-kings."Dragon-kings represent extreme eventswhich are of a class of their own.They are special. They are outliers.They are generated by specific mechanismsthat may make them predictable,perhaps controllable.Consider the financial price time series,a given stock, your perfect stock,or a global index.You have these up-and-downs.A very good measure of the risk of this financial marketis the peaks-to-valleys that representa worst case scenariowhen you bought at the top and sold at the bottom.You can look at the statistics, the frequency of the occurrenceof peak-to-valleys of different sizes,which is represented in this graph.Now, interestingly, 99 percentof the peak-to-valleys of different amplitudescan be represented by a universal power lawrepresented by this red line here.More interestingly, there are outliers, there are exceptionswhich are above this red line,occur 100 times more frequently, at least,than the extrapolation would predict them to occurbased on the calibration of the 99 percent remainingpeak-to-valleys.They are due to trenchant dependanciessuch that a loss is followed by a losswhich is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss.These kinds of dependenciesare largely missed by standard risk management tools,which ignore them and see lizardswhen they should see dragon-kings.The root mechanism of a dragon-kingis a slow maturation towards instability,which is the bubble,and the climax of the bubble is often the crash.This is similar to the slow heating of waterin this test tube reaching the boiling point,where the instability of the water occursand you have the phase transition to vapor.And this process, which is absolutely non-linear --cannot be predicted by standard techniques --is the reflection of a collective emergent behaviorwhich is fundamentally endogenous.So the cause of the crash, the cause of the crisishas to be found in an inner instability of the system,and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur.Now, some of you may have come to the mindthat is this not related to the black swan conceptyou have heard about frequently?Remember, black swan is this rare birdthat you see once and suddenly shattered your beliefthat all swans should be white,so it has captured the idea of unpredictability,unknowability, that the extreme eventsare fundamentally unknowable.Nothing can be furtherfrom the dragon-king concept I propose,which is exactly the opposite, that most extreme eventsare actually knowable and predictable.So we can be empowered and take responsibilityand make predictions about them.So let's have my dragon-king burn this black swan concept.(Laughter)There are many early warning signalsthat are predicted by this theory.Let me just focus on one of them:the super-exponential growth with positive feedback.What does it mean?Imagine you have an investmentthat returns the first year five percent,the second year 10 percent, the third year 20 percent,the next year 40 percent. Is that not marvelous?This is a super-exponential growth.A standard exponential growth correspondsto a constant growth rate, let's say, of 10 percentThe point is that, many times during bubbles,there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times,such that previous growths enhance,push forward, increase the next growththrough this kind of super-exponential growth,which is very trenchant, not sustainable.And the key idea is that the mathematical solutionof this class of models exhibit finite-time singularities,which means that there is a critical timewhere the system will break, will change regime.It may be a crash. It may be just a plateau, something else.And the key idea is that the critical time,the information about the critical time is containedin the early development of this super-exponential growth.We have applied this theory early on, that was our first success,to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elementson the iron rocket.Using acoustic emission, you know, this little noisethat you hear a structure emit, sing to youwhen they are stressed, and reveal the damage going on,there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback,the more damage gives the more damage,so you can actually predict,within, of course, a probability band,when the rupture will occur.So this is now so successful that it is usedin the initial phase of [unclear] the flight.Perhaps more surprisingly, the same type of theoryapplies to biology and medicine,parturition, the act of giving birth, epileptic seizures.From seven months of pregnancy, a motherstarts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterusthat are the sign of these maturationstoward the instability, giving birth to the baby,the dragon-king.So if you measure the precursor signal,you can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problemsin advance.Epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size,and when the brain goes to a super-critical state,you have dragon-kings which have a degree of predictabilityand this can help the patient to deal with this illness.We have applied this theory to many systems,landslides, glacier collapse,even to the dynamics of prediction of success:blockbusters, YouTube videos, movies, and so on.But perhaps the most important applicationis for finance, and this theoryilluminates, I believe, the deep reasonfor the financial crisis that we have gone through.This is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles,starting in 1980, with the global bubblecrashing in 1987,followed by many other bubbles.The biggest one was the "new economy" Internet bubblein 2000, crashing in 2000,the real estate bubbles in many countries,financial derivative bubbles everywhere,stock market bubbles also everywhere,commodity and all bubbles, debt and credit bubbles --bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.We had a global bubble.This is a measure of global overvaluationof all markets, expressing what I callan illusion of a perpetual money machinethat suddenly broke in 2007.The problem is that we see the same process,in particular through quantitative easing,of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadaysto tackle the crisis since 2008 in the U.S., in Europe,in Japan.This has very important implicationsto understand the failure of quantitative easingas well as austerity measuresas long as we don't attack the core,the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking.Now, these are big claims.Why would you believe me?Well, perhaps because, in the last 15 yearswe have come out of our ivory tower,and started to publish ex ante --and I stress the term ex ante, it means "in advance" —before the crash confirmedthe existence of the bubble or the financial excesses.These are a few of the major bubblesthat we have lived through in recent history.Again, many interesting stories for each of them.Let me tell you just one or two storiesthat deal with massive bubbles.We all know the Chinese miracle.This is the expression of the stock marketof a massive bubble, a factor of three,300 percent in just a few years.In September 2007,I was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fundmanagement conference,and I showed to the conference a predictionthat by the end of 2007, this bubblewould change regime.There might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable.Now, how do you believe the very smart,very motivated, very informed macro hedge fund managersreacted to this prediction?You know, they had made billionsjust surfing this bubble until now.They told me, "Didier,yeah, the market might be overvalued,but you forget something.There is the Beijing Olympic Games comingin August 2008, and it's very clear thatthe Chinese government is controlling the economyand doing what it takesto also avoid any wave and control the stock market."Three weeks after my presentation,the markets lost 20 percentand went through a phase of volatility,upheaval, and a total market loss of70 percent until the end of the year.So how can we be so collectively wrongby misreading or ignoring the scienceof the fact that when an instability has developed,and the system is ripe, any perturbationmakes it essentially impossible to control?The Chinese market collapsed, but it rebounded.In 2009, we also identified that this new bubble,a smaller one, was unsustainable,so we published again a prediction, in advance,stating that by August 2009, the market will correct,will not continue on this track.Our critics, reading the prediction,said, "No, it's not possible.The Chinese government is there.They have learned their lesson. They will control.They want to benefit from the growth."Perhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously.So the crisis did occur. The market corrected.The same critics then said, "Ah, yes,but you published your prediction.You influenced the market.It was not a prediction."Maybe I am very powerful then.Now, this is interesting.It shows that it's essentially impossible until nowto develop a science of economicsbecause we are sentient beings who anticipateand there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies.So we invented a new way of doing science.We created the Financial Bubble Experiment.The idea is the following. We monitor the markets.We identify excesses, bubbles.We do our work. We write a reportin which we put our prediction of the critical time.We don't release the report. It's kept secret.But with modern encrypting techniques,we have a hash, we publish a public key,and six months later, we release the report,and there is authentication.And all this is done on an international archiveso that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes.Let me tease you with a very recent analysis.17th of May, 2013, just two weeks ago,we identified that the U.S. stock marketwas on an unsustainable pathand we released this on our website on the 21st of Maythat there will be a change of regime.The next day, the market started to change regime, course.This is not a crash.This is just the third or fourth actof a massive bubble in the making.Scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet,we see the same thing.Wherever we look, it's observable:in the biosphere, in the atmosphere, in the ocean,showing these super-exponential trajectoriescharacterizing an unsustainable pathand announcing a phase transition.This diagram on the rightshows a very beautiful compilation of studiessuggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear -- possibilityfor a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades.So there are bubbles everywhere.From one side, this is excitingfor me, as a professor who chases bubblesand slays dragons, as the media has sometimes called me.But can we really slay the dragons?Very recently, with collaborators,we studied a dynamical systemwhere you see the dragon-king as these big loopsand we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right timesthat removed, when control is on, these dragons."Gouverner, c'est prévoir."Governing is the art of planning and predicting.But is it not the case that this is probablyone of the biggest gaps of mankind,which has the responsibility to steerour societies and our planet toward sustainabilityin the face of growing challenges and crises?But the dragon-king theory gives hope.We learn that most systems have pockets of predictability.It is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crisesso that we can be prepared, we can take measures,we can take responsibility,and so that never again willextremes and crises like the Great Recessionor the European crisis take us by surprise.Thank you.(Applause)

When I was 27 years old,I went to teach seventh graders mathin the New York City public schools.I gave out homework assignments.between my best and my worst students.And that got me thinking.But these concepts are not impossible,could learn the materialif they worked hard and long enough.After several more years of teaching,from a motivational perspective,from a psychological perspective.depends on much moreSo I left the classroom,I started studying kids and adultsand in every study my question was,who is successful here and why?We tried to predict which cadetsWe went to the National Spelling Beeby the end of the school year,And who's going to earn the most money?In all those very different contexts,And it wasn't social intelligence.It wasn't good looks, physical health,and it wasn't IQ.It was grit.Grit is having stamina.but for years,A few years ago,I asked thousands of high school juniorsto take grit questionnaires,and then waited around more than a yearto see who would graduate.Turns out that grittier kidsthings like family income,standardized achievement test scores,that grit matters.It's also in school,To me, the most shocking thing about gritis how little we know,Every day, parents and teachers ask me,"How do I build grit in kids?The honest answer is,I don't know.(Laughter)Our data show very clearlythat there are many talented individualsis something called "growth mindset."that it can change with your effort.Dr. Dweck has shownBut we need more.because that's where we are.That's the work that stands before us.and we need to test them.to start over again with lessons learned.In other words, we need to be grittyabout getting our kids grittier.Thank you.(Applause)

I'm a little nervous, because my wife Yvonne said to me,she said, "Geoff, you watch the TED Talks."I said, "Yes, honey, I love TED Talks."She said, "You know, they're like, really smart, talented -- "I said, "I know, I know." (Laughter)She said, "They don't want, like, the angry black man."(Laughter)So I said, "No, I'm gonna be good, Honey,I'm gonna be good. I am."But I am angry. (Laughter)And the last time I looked, I'm --(Applause)So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry.This year, there are going to be millions of our childrenthat we're going to needlessly lose,that we could -- right now, we could save them all.You saw the quality of the educators who were here.Do not tell me they could not reach those kidsand save them. I know they could.It is absolutely possible.Why haven't we fixed this?Those of us in education have held on to a business planthat we don't care how many millions of young people fail,we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work,and nobody is getting crazy about it -- right? --enough to say, "Enough is enough."So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense.You know, I grew up in the inner city,and there were kids who were failingin schools 56 years ago when I first went to school,and those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later.And you know something about a lousy school?It's not like a bottle of wine.Right? (Laughter)Where you say, like, '87 was like a good year, right?That's now how this thing -- I mean, every single year,it's still the same approach, right?One size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't,tough luck. Just tough luck.Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen?Do not tell me we can't do better than this.Look, you go into a place that's failed kids for 50 years,and you say, "So what's the plan?"And they say, "We'll, we're going to dowhat we did last year this year."What kind of business model is that?Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3.They operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour.Now, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed.They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks.Who created that business model? Right?And it went on for decades.You know why? Because they didn't care.It wasn't about the customers.It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them.How could you go to the bankwhen you were at work? It didn't matter.And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upsethe can't go to the bank. Go find another bank.They all operate the same way. Right?Now, one day, some crazy banker had an idea.Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work.They might like that. What about a Saturday?What about introducing technology?Now look, I'm a technology fan, but I have to admitto you all I'm a little old.So I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology,and when they first came out with those new contraptions,these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money,I was like, "There's no way that machine is going to count that money right.I am never using that, right?"So technology has changed. Things have changed.Yet not in education. Why?Why is it that when we had rotary phones,when we were having folks being crippled by polio,that we were teachingthe same way then that we're doing right now?And if you come up with a plan to change things,people consider you radical.They will say the worst things about you.I said one day, well, look, if the science says --this is science, not me -- that our poorest childrenlose ground in the summertime --You see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there.You look at them in September, they've gone down.You say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75when I was at the Ed School at Harvard.I said, "Oh, wow, this is an important study."Because it suggests we should do something.(Laughter)Every 10 years they reproduce the same study.It says exactly the same thing:Poor kids lose ground in the summertime.The system decides you can't run schools in the summer.You know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules?For years I went to -- Look, I went the Harvard Ed School.I thought I knew something.They said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had —but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense.I never got that. I never got that,because anyone knows if you farm,you don't plant crops in July and August.You plant them in the spring.So who came up with this idea? Who owns it?Why did we ever do it?Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have,schools were open all year. They were open all year,because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day.They didn't have any place for their kids to go.It was a perfect place to have schools.So this is not something that is ordainedfrom the education gods.So why don't we? Why don't we?Because our business has refused to use science.Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying,"Look, this works, right? We can do this."How many places in America are going to change? None.None. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right?Yes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing.As a profession, we have to stop this. The science is clear.Here's what we know.We know that the problem begins immediately.Right? This idea, zero to three.My wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids,three grown ones and a 15-year-old.That's a longer story.(Laughter)With our first kids, we did not know the scienceabout brain development.We didn't know how critical those first three years were.We didn't know what was happening in those young brains.We didn't know the role that language,a stimulus and response, call and response,how important that was in developing those children.We know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing.Wealthy people know. Educated people know.And their kids have an advantage.Poor people don't know,and we're not doing anything to help them at all.But we know this is critical.Now, you take pre-kindergarten.We know it's important for kids.Poor kids need that experience.Nope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist.We know health services matter.You know, we provide health servicesand people are always fussing at me about, you know,because I'm all into accountability and dataand all of that good stuff, but we do health services,and I have to raise a lot of money.People used to say when they'd come fund us,"Geoff, why do you provide these health services?"I used to make stuff up. Right?I'd say, "Well, you know a childwho has cavities is not going to, uh,be able to study as well."And I had to because I had to raise the money.But now I'm older, and you know what I tell them?You know why I provide kids with those health benefitsand the sports and the recreation and the arts?Because I actually like kids.I actually like kids. (Laughter) (Applause)But when they really get pushy, people really get pushy,I say, "I do it because you do it for your kid."And you've never read a study from MIT that saysgiving your kid dance instructionis going to help them do algebra better,but you will give that kid dance instruction,and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction,and it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kidshave the same opportunity? It's the floor for these children.(Applause)So here's the other thing.I'm a tester guy. I believe you need data, you need information,because you work at something, you think it's working,and you find out it's not working.I mean, you're educators. You work, you say,you think you've got it, great, no? And you find out they didn't get it.But here's the problem with testing.The testing that we do --we're going to have our test in New York next week —is in April.You know when we're going to get the results back?Maybe July, maybe June.And the results have great data.They'll tell you Raheem really struggled,couldn't do two-digit multiplication -- so great data,but you're getting it back after school is over.And so, what do you do?You go on vacation. (Laughter)You come back from vacation.Now you've got all of this test data from last year.You don't look at it.Why would you look at it?You're going to go and teach this year.So how much money did we just spend on all of that?Billions and billions of dollarsfor data that it's too late to use.I need that data in September.I need that data in November.I need to know you're struggling, and I need to knowwhether or not what I did corrected that.I need to know that this week.I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late.Because in my older years, I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant.I can predict school scores.You take me to any school.I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling.And you tell me last year 48 percent of those kidswere on grade level.And I say, "Okay, what's the plan, what did we dofrom last year to this year?"You say, "We're doing the same thing."I'm going to make a prediction. (Laughter)This year, somewhere between 44and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level.And I will be right every single time.So we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what?Teachers need real information right nowabout what's happening to their kids.The high stakes is today, because you can do something about it.So here's the other issue that I just thinkwe've got to be concerned about.We can't stifle innovation in our business.We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation.They get angry if you do something different.If you try something new, people are always like,"Ooh, charter schools." Hey, let's try some stuff. Let's see.This stuff hasn't worked for 55 years.Let's try something different. And here's the rub.Some of it's not going to work.You know, people tell me, "Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work."A lot of them don't. They should be closed.I mean, I really believe they should be closed.But we can't confuse figuring out the scienceand things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything.Right? Because that's not the way the world works.If you think about technology,imagine if that's how we thought about technology.Every time something didn't work,we just threw in the towel and said, "Let's forget it." Right?You know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me --the latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot.They told me, "Geoff, if you get this PalmPilotyou'll never need another thing."That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over.I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing.Did anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul.The folks went out there. They kept inventing.The fact that you have failure, that shouldn't stop youfrom pushing the science forward.Our job as educators,there's some stuff we know that we can do.And we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier,we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people.We've got to give them all of these opportunities.So that we have to do. But this innovation issue,this idea that we've got to keep innovatinguntil we really nail this science downis something that is absolutely critical.And this is something, by the way,that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field.America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right.We have run out of time.I don't know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there's an educational cliffthat we are walking over right this very second,and if we allow folks to continue this foolishnessabout saying we can't afford this —So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars.What is five billion dollars to the United States?What did we spend in Afghanistan this year?How many trillions? (Applause)When the country cares about something,we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye.When the safety of America is threatened,we will spend any amount of money.The real safety of our nationis preparing this next generationso that they can take our placeand be the leaders of the worldwhen it comes to thinking and technology and democracyand all that stuff we care about.I dare say it's a pittance,what it would require for us to reallybegin to solve some of these problems.So once we do that, I'll no longer be angry. (Laughter)So, you guys, help me get there.Thank you all very much. Thank you.(Applause)John Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone?Geoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John,100 percent of our kids graduated high schoollast year in my school.A hundred percent of them went to college.This year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school.Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college.We'd better get that other seven percent.So that's just how this goes. (Applause)JL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school?GC: Well, you know, one of the bad problemswe have in this country is these kids, the same kids,these same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school,they drop out in record numbers.And so we've figured out that you've got to really designa network of support for these kids that in many waysmimics what a good parent does.They harass you, right? They call you, they say,"I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test?What are you talking about that you want to leave school?And you're not coming back here."So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlembecause Geoff is looking for you.They're like, "I really can't come back." No. You'd better stay in school.But I'm not kidding about some of this,and it gets a little bit to the grit issue.When kids know that you refuse to let them fail,it puts a different pressure on them,and they don't give up as easy.So sometimes they don't have it inside,and they're, like, "You know, I don't want to do this,but I know my mother's going to be mad."Well, that matters to kids, and it helps get them through.We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoringand help and support, but also a set of encouragementsthat say to them, "You can do it. It is going to be hard,but we refuse to let you fail."JL: Well, thank you Dr. Canada.Please give it up for him one more time.(Applause)



timothy_bartik_the_economic_case_for_preschool
396265

In this talk today, I want to present a different ideafor why investing in early childhood educationmakes sense as a public investment.It's a different idea, because usually,when people talk about early childhood programs,they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participantsin terms of former participants, in preschool,they have better K-12 test scores,better adult earnings.Now that's all very important,but what I want to talk about is what preschool doesfor state economiesand for promoting state economic development.And that's actually crucialbecause if we're going to get increased investmentin early childhood programs,we need to interest state governments in this.The federal government has a lot on its plate,and state governments are going to have to step up.So we have to appeal to them,the legislators in the state government,and turn to something they understand,that they have to promote the economic developmentof their state economy.Now, by promoting economic development,I don't mean anything magical.All I mean is, is that early childhood educationcan bring more and better jobs to a stateand can thereby promote higher per capita earningsfor the state's residents.Now, I think it's fair to say that when people think aboutstate and local economic development,they don't generally think first about what they're doingabout childcare and early childhood programs.I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs.I've talked to a lot of directorsof state economic development agencies about these issues,a lot of legislators about these issues.When legislators and others think about economic development,what they first of all think about are business tax incentives,property tax abatements, job creation tax credits,you know, there are a million of these programs all over the place.So for example, states compete very vigorouslyto attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.Now, those programs can make senseif they in fact induce new location decisions,and the way they can make sense is,by creating more and better jobs,they raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents.So there is a benefit to state residentsthat corresponds to the costs that they're payingby paying for these business tax breaks.My argument is essentially that early childhood programscan do exactly the same thing,create more and better jobs, but in a different way.It's a somewhat more indirect way.These programs can promote more and better jobs by,you build it, you invest in high-quality preschool,it develops the skills of your local workforceif enough of them stick around, and, in turn,that higher-quality local workforcewill be a key driver of creating jobs and creatinghigher earnings per capita in the local community.Now, let me turn to some numbers on this.Okay. If you look at the research evidence --that's extensive -- on how much early childhood programsaffect the educational attainment, wages and skillsof former participants in preschool as adults,you take those known effects,you take how many of those folks will be expectedto stick around the state or local economy and not move out,and you take research on how much skillsdrive job creation, you will conclude,from these three separate lines of research,that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs,the per capita earnings of state residentsgo up by two dollars and 78 cents,so that's a three-to-one return.Now you can get much higher returns,of up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits,if you include benefits to former preschool participantswho move to some other state,but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollarsbecause this is salient and importantto state legislators and state policy makers,and it's the states that are going to have to act.So there is this key benefit that is relevantto state policy makers in terms of economic development.Now, one objection you often hear,or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is,why should I pay more taxesto invest in other people's children?What's in it for me?And the trouble with that objection,it reflects a total misunderstandingof how much local economiesinvolve everyone being interdependent.Specifically, the interdependency here is, is thatthere are huge spillovers of skills --that when other people's children get more skills,that actually increases the prosperity of everyone,including people whose skills don't change.So for example, numerous research studies have shownif you look at what really drivesthe growth rate of metropolitan areas,it's not so much low taxes, low cost, low wages;it's the skills of the area. Particularly, the proxy for skillsthat people use is percentage of college graduates in the area.So when you look, for example, at metropolitan areassuch as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul,Silicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economicallybecause they're low-cost.I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley.It's not exactly a low-cost proposition.They are growing because they have high levels of skills.So when we invest in other people's children,and build up those skills, we increase the overall job growthof a metro area.As another example, if we lookat what determines an individual's wages,and we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages,we know that the individual's wages will depend, in part,on that individual's education,for example whether or not they have a college degree.One of the very interesting facts is that, in addition,we find that even once we hold constant, statistically,the effect of your own education,the education of everyone else in your metropolitan areaalso affects your wages.So specifically, if you hold constant your education,you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area,you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wageswithout changing your education at all.In fact, this effect is so strongthat when someone gets a college degree,the spillover effects of this on the wagesof others in the metropolitan areaare actually greater than the direct effects.So if someone gets a college degree, their lifetime earningsgo up by a huge amount, over 700,000 dollars.There's an effect on everyone else in the metro areaof driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area,and if you add that up -- it's a small effect for each person,but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area,you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone elsein the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars.That's actually greater than the direct benefitsof the person choosing to get education.Now, what's going on here?What can explain these huge spillover effects of education?Well, let's think about it this way.I can be the most skilled person in the world,but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills,my employer is going to find it more difficultto introduce new technology, new production techniques.So as a result, my employer is going to be less productive.They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages.Even if everyone at my firm has good skills,if the workers at the suppliers to my firmdo not have good skills,my firm is going to be less competitivecompeting in national and international markets.And again, the firm that's less competitivewill not be able to pay as good wages,and then, particularly in high-tech businesses,they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses.So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valleyhas a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm,but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area.So as a result, if we can invest in other people's childrenthrough preschool and other early childhood programsthat are high-quality, we not only help those children,we help everyone in the metropolitan areagain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan areagain in job growth.Another objection used sometimes hereto invest in early childhood programsis concern about people moving out.So, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investingin more preschool educationfor children in Columbus, Ohio,but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will,for some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan,and become Wolverines.And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investingin preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worriedthese little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes.And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out.Well, the reality is, if you look at the data,Americans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume.The data is that over 60 percent of Americansspend most of their working careersin the state they were born in, over 60 percent.That percentage does not vary much from state to state.It doesn't vary much with the state's economy,whether it's depressed or booming,it doesn't vary much over time.So the reality is, if you invest in kids,they will stay.Or at least, enough of them will staythat it will pay off for your state economy.Okay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidencethat early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way,pay off in higher adult skills.There's a lot of research evidencethat those folks will stick around the state economy,and there's a lot of evidence that having more workerswith higher skills in your local economypays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy,and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar,we get about three dollars backin benefits for the state economy.So in my opinion, the research evidence is compellingand the logic of this is compelling.So what are the barriers to getting it done?Well, one obvious barrier is cost.So if you look at what it would costif every state government investedin universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four,the total annual national cost would be roughly30 billion dollars.So, 30 billion dollars is a lot of money.On the other hand, if you reflect onthat the U.S.'s population is over 300 million,we're talking about an amount of moneythat amounts to 100 dollars per capita.Okay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person,is something that any state government can afford to do.It's just a simple matter of political will to do it.And, of course, as I mentioned,this cost has corresponding benefits.I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three,2.78, for the state economy,in terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings.And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollarsto something that might mean something,what we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid,that would increase earnings by about 10 percentover their whole career, just doing the preschool,not improving K-12 or anything else after that,not doing anything with college tuition or access,just directly improving preschool,and we would get five percent higher earningsfor middle-class kids.So this is an investmentthat pays off in very concrete termsfor a broad range of income groups in the state's populationand produces large and tangible benefits.Now, that's one barrier.I actually think the more profound barrieris the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs.So the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasingthe quality of our local workforce,and thereby increasing economic development.Obviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds,we're not sending these kids out at age fiveto work in the sweatshops, right? At least I hope not.So we're talking about an investmentthat in terms of impacts on the state economyis not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years,and of course America is notorious for beinga short term-oriented society.Now one response you can make to this,and I sometimes have done this in talks,is people can talk about, there are benefits for these programsin reducing special ed and remedial education costs,there are benefits, parents care about preschool,maybe we'll get some migration effectsfrom parents seeking good preschool,and I think those are true,but in some sense they're missing the point.Ultimately, this is somethingwe're investing in now for the future.And so what I want to leave you with iswhat I think is the ultimate question.I mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimatelynot an economic question, it's a moral question:Are we willing, as Americans,are we as a society still capableof making the political choice to sacrifice nowby paying more taxesin order to improve the long-term futureof not only our kids, but our community?Are we still capable of that as a country?And that's something that each and every citizenand voter needs to ask themselves.Is that something that you are still invested in,that you still believe in the notion of investment?That is the notion of investment.You sacrifice now for a return later.So I think the research evidenceon the benefits of early childhood programsfor the local economy is extremely strong.However, the moral and political choiceis still up to us, as citizens and as voters.Thank you very much.

What you're doing,right now, at this very moment,is killing you.More than cars or the Internetor even that little mobile device we keep talking about,the technology you're using the most almost every dayis this, your tush.Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day,which is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours.Sitting is so incredibly prevalent,we don't even question how much we're doing it,and because everyone else is doing it,it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay.In that way, sitting has becomethe smoking of our generation.Of course there's health consequences to this,scary ones, besides the waist.Things like breast cancer and colon cancerare directly tied to our lack of physical [activity],Ten percent in fact, on both of those.Six percent for heart disease,seven percent for type 2 diabetes,which is what my father died of.Now, any of those stats should convince each of usto get off our duff more,but if you're anything like me, it won't.What did get me moving was a social interaction.Someone invited me to a meeting,but couldn't manage to fit me into a regular sort of conference room meeting, and said,"I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then?"It seemed kind of odd to do,and actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking,"I have to be the one to ask the next question,"because I knew I was going to huff and puffduring this conversation.And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own.So instead of going to coffee meetingsor fluorescent-lit conference room meetings,I ask people to go on a walking meeting,to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week.It's changed my life.But before that, what actually happened was,I used to think about it as,you could take care of your health,or you could take care of obligations,and one always came at the cost of the other.So now, several hundred of these walking meetings later,I've learned a few things.First, there's this amazing thingabout actually getting out of the boxthat leads to out-of-the-box thinking.Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works.And second, and probably the more reflective one,is just about how much each of uscan hold problems in oppositionwhen they're really not that way.And if we're going to solve problemsand look at the world really differently,whether it's in governance or businessor environmental issues, job creation,maybe we can think about how to reframe those problemsas having both things be true.Because it was when that happenedwith this walk-and-talk ideathat things became doable and sustainable and viable.So I started this talk talking about the tush,so I'll end with the bottom line, which is,walk and talk.Walk the talk.You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking,and in the way that you do,you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas.Thank you.(Applause)

Growth is not dead.(Applause)Let's start the story 120 years ago,when American factories began to electrify their operations,igniting the Second Industrial Revolution.The amazing thing isthat productivity did not increase in those factoriesfor 30 years. Thirty years.That's long enough for a generation of managers to retire.You see, the first wave of managerssimply replaced their steam engines with electric motors,but they didn't redesign the factories to take advantageof electricity's flexibility.It fell to the next generation to invent new work processes,and then productivity soared,often doubling or even tripling in those factories.Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology,like the steam engine before it.General purpose technologies drive most economic growth,because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations,like lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign.Is there a general purpose technology of our era?Sure. It's the computer.But technology alone is not enough.Technology is not destiny.We shape our destiny,and just as the earlier generations of managersneeded to redesign their factories,we're going to need to reinvent our organizationsand even our whole economic system.We're not doing as well at that job as we should be.As we'll see in a moment,productivity is actually doing all right,but it has become decoupled from jobs,and the income of the typical worker is stagnating.These troubles are sometimes misdiagnosedas the end of innovation,but they are actually the growing painsof what Andrew McAfee and I call the new machine age.Let's look at some data.So here's GDP per person in America.There's some bumps along the way, but the big storyis you could practically fit a ruler to it.This is a log scale, so what looks like steady growthis actually an acceleration in real terms.And here's productivity.You can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid-'70s,but it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution,when factories were learning how to electrify their operations.After a lag, productivity accelerated again.So maybe "history doesn't repeat itself,but sometimes it rhymes."Today, productivity is at an all-time high,and despite the Great Recession,it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s,the roaring 1990s, and that was faster than the '70s or '80s.It's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution.And that's just the United States.The global news is even better.Worldwide incomes have grown at a faster ratein the past decade than ever in history.If anything, all these numbers actually understate our progress,because the new machine ageis more about knowledge creationthan just physical production.It's mind not matter, brain not brawn,ideas not things.That creates a problem for standard metrics,because we're getting more and more stuff for free,like Wikipedia, Google, Skype,and if they post it on the web, even this TED Talk.Now getting stuff for free is a good thing, right?Sure, of course it is.But that's not how economists measure GDP.Zero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics.According to the numbers, the music industryis half the size that it was 10 years ago,but I'm listening to more and better music than ever.You know, I bet you are too.In total, my research estimatesthat the GDP numbers miss over 300 billion dollars per yearin free goods and services on the Internet.Now let's look to the future.There are some super smart peoplewho are arguing that we've reached the end of growth,but to understand the future of growth,we need to make predictionsabout the underlying drivers of growth.I'm optimistic, because the new machine ageis digital, exponential and combinatorial.When goods are digital, they can be replicatedwith perfect quality at nearly zero cost,and they can be delivered almost instantaneously.Welcome to the economics of abundance.But there's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world.Measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress.In the age of big data,we can measure the world in ways we never could before.Secondly, the new machine age is exponential.Computers get better faster than anything else ever.A child's Playstation today is more powerfulthan a military supercomputer from 1996.But our brains are wired for a linear world.As a result, exponential trends take us by surprise.I used to teach my students that there are some things,you know, computers just aren't good at,like driving a car through traffic.(Laughter)That's right, here's Andy and me grinning like madmenbecause we just rode down Route 101in, yes, a driverless car.Thirdly, the new machine age is combinatorial.The stagnationist view is that ideas get used up,like low-hanging fruit,but the reality is that each innovationcreates building blocks for even more innovations.Here's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks,an undergraduate student of minebuilt an app that ultimately reached 1.3 million users.He was able to do that so easilybecause he built it on top of Facebook,and Facebook was built on top of the web,and that was built on top of the Internet,and so on and so forth.Now individually, digital, exponential and combinatorialwould each be game-changers.Put them together, and we're seeing a waveof astonishing breakthroughs,like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetahor leap tall buildings in a single bound.You know, robots are even revolutionizingcat transportation.(Laughter)But perhaps the most important invention,the most important invention is machine learning.Consider one project: IBM's Watson.These little dots here,those are all the champions on the quiz show "Jeopardy."At first, Watson wasn't very good,but it improved at a rate faster than any human could,and shortly after Dave Ferrucci showed this chartto my class at MIT,Watson beat the world "Jeopardy" champion.At age seven, Watson is still kind of in its childhood.Recently, its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised.The next day, it started answering questions with profanities.Damn. (Laughter)But you know, Watson is growing up fast.It's being tested for jobs in call centers, and it's getting them.It's applying for legal, banking and medical jobs,and getting some of them.Isn't it ironic that at the very momentwe are building intelligent machines,perhaps the most important invention in human history,some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating?Like the first two industrial revolutions,the full implications of the new machine ageare going to take at least a century to fully play out,but they are staggering.So does that mean we have nothing to worry about?No. Technology is not destiny.Productivity is at an all time high,but fewer people now have jobs.We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever,but for a majority of Americans, their income has fallen.This is the great decouplingof productivity from employment,of wealth from work.You know, it's not surprising that millions of peoplehave become disillusioned by the great decoupling,but like too many others,they misunderstand its basic causes.Technology is racing ahead,but it's leaving more and more people behind.Today, we can take a routine job,codify it in a set of machine-readable instructions,and then replicate it a million times.You know, I recently overheard a conversationthat epitomizes these new economics.This guy says, "Nah, I don't use H&amp;R Block anymore.TurboTax does everything that my tax preparer did,but it's faster, cheaper and more accurate."How can a skilled workercompete with a $39 piece of software?She can't.Today, millions of Americans do have faster,cheaper, more accurate tax preparation,and the founders of Intuithave done very well for themselves.But 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs.That is a microcosm of what's happening,not just in software and services, but in media and music,in finance and manufacturing, in retailing and trade --in short, in every industry.People are racing against the machine,and many of them are losing that race.What can we do to create shared prosperity?The answer is not to try to slow down technology.Instead of racing against the machine,we need to learn to race with the machine.That is our grand challenge.The new machine agecan be dated to a day 15 years agowhen Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion,played Deep Blue, a supercomputer.The machine won that day,and today, a chess program running on a cell phonecan beat a human grandmaster.It got so bad that, when he was askedwhat strategy he would use against a computer,Jan Donner, the Dutch grandmaster, replied,"I'd bring a hammer."(Laughter)But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion.Neither is a human,because Kasparov organized a freestyle tournamentwhere teams of humans and computerscould work together,and the winning team had no grandmaster,and it had no supercomputer.What they had was better teamwork,and they showed that a team of humans and computers,working together, could beat any computeror any human working alone.Racing with the machinebeats racing against the machine.Technology is not destiny.We shape our destiny.Thank you.(Applause)

When we think about how people work,the naive intuition we haveis that people are like rats in a maze --that all people care about is money,and the moment we give them money,we can direct them to work one way,we can direct them to work another way.At the same time, if you think about it,No, they are full of misery.and difficulty breathing --cold, challenging circumstances.the moment they would get to the top,I'll never do it again."(Laughter)But instead, people go down,and after they recover, they go up again.it suggests all kinds of things.to work or behave in all kinds of ways.after a student came to visit me.and he came one day back to campus.And he told me the following story:He said that for more than two weeks,He was working in a big bank,graphs, tables, information.He stayed late at night every day.And the day before it was due,and his boss wrote him back and said,And the guy was deeply depressed.Now at the moment when he was working,he was actually quite happy.Every night he was enjoying his work,with this idea of the fruits of our labor.in which we gave people Legos,and we asked them to build with Legos.We'll pay you three dollars for it."this time for $2.70?"and when they finished, we asked them,until at some point people said,"No more. It's not worth it for me."People built one Bionicle after another.After they finished every one of them,we put them under the table.we will put them back in the boxes,There was another condition.and when he almost got to the end,Also, if you look at prison movies,of doing something over and over and overthat's exactly what we did.We asked people,And if they said yes, they built it.and as they were building it,And when they finished that,this time for 30 cents less?"And if they said yes,and us destroying in front of their eyes.eleven in the meaningful condition,versus seven in the Sisyphus condition.And not only that, everybody knewIn this other version of the experiment,we didn't put people in this situation,we just described to them the situation,much as I am describing to you now,What happened?said that in the meaningful condition,the extent to which it's important.and some people who don't.and the amount of Legos people built.What happened in the Sisyphic condition?and how much people built,We basically eliminated it.that was put in a different building,and they asked them to innovate,And the week before I showed up,and canceled the project.And I stood there in front of 200And I asked them, I said,And everybody raised their hand.Everybody raised their hand.I asked them, "How many of you now addAnd they didn't raise their hands,but they took me out to dinnerAnd then I asked them, I said,And they came up with all kinds of ideas.and what they decided to do.and see how they would work.If the CEO, just like our participants,then he [wouldn't] care.everything will be okay."to spend some time, energy and effortthat were identical next to each other.That was the task.People did the first sheet,And we had three conditions.found all the pairs of letters,gave it to the experimenter,the experimenter would look at it,scan it from top to bottom,The experimenter looked at it,and simply put it on the pile of pages.In the third condition,the experimenter got the sheet of paper,and put it directly into a shredder.(Laughter)What happened in those three conditions?They worked for much longer.In the acknowledged condition,At 15 cents per page,they basically stopped these efforts.You shred people's efforts, output --But I should point out, by the way,They could have done not so good work,so you would do more and more and more.So in fact, in the shredder condition,and put less effort into it.But what about the ignored condition?Now there's good news and bad news here.Ignoring gets you a whole way out there.scanning it and saying "Uh huh,"that seems to be quite sufficientSo the good news is that adding motivationdoesn't seem to be so difficult.seems to be incredibly easy,or eliminating negative motivation.that takes a long time to assemble.(Laughter)I don't know about you,but every time I assemble one of those,I can't say I enjoy those pieces.I can't say I enjoy the process.But when I finish it,more than I like other ones.(Laughter)And there's an old story about cake mixes.stir some water in it,But it turns out they were very unpopular.People did not want them,Maybe the taste was not good?No, the taste was great.and say, "Here is my cake."It didn't really feel like your own.So what did they do?(Laughter)(Laughter)(Applause)by getting people to work harder,to a higher degree.We asked people to build some origami.and we gave them a sheet of paper.And these were all novices,nothing like a frog or a crane.How much do you want to pay for it?"And we had two types of people:We had the people who built it,and the people who did not build it,(Laughter)Which one of those two is correct?We tried to make it more difficult.So for some people, we gave the same task.of how you fold origami.For some people, we just eliminated that.So now this was tougher.What happened?Well in an objective way,When you looked at the hard instructions,the effect was larger.Why?(Laughter)They put all this extra effort into it.And evaluators?They loved it even less.(Laughter)Now think about kids.Your memories and associations and so on.(Laughter)On good days.(Laughter)But imagine this was slightly different.Imagine if you did not have your kids.They were just like your kids,and you played with them for a few hours,(Laughter)How much would you pay for them now?Most people say not that much.not just because of who they are,but because of us,because they are so connected to us,and because of the time and connection.(Laughter)Which comes to tell you one more thing,which is, much like our builders,Let me say one last comment.He gave an example of a pin factory.He said pins have 12 different steps,But if you get one person to do step one,production can increase tremendously.And indeed, this is a great example,Karl Marx, on the other hand,I think that in the Industrial Revolution,But the reality is that we've switched,and now we're in the knowledge economy.I think the answer is no.I think that as we move to situationsand in the shower and so on,So when we think about labor,and thought about them --and how do we do it in our workplace,and for the employees --Thank you very much.(Applause)

I want to talk about social innovationand social entrepreneurship.I happen to have triplets.They're little. They're five years old.(Laughter)Now, I also happen to be gay.Being gay and fathering triplets is by farI have ever done.(Laughter)(Applause)about giving and about charityand about the nonprofit sector,in changing the world.that is most disadvantaged or unlucky.And social business needs markets,and these people want laughterand compassion and they want love.How do you monetize that?Philanthropy is the market for love.It is the market for all those peoplefor whom there is no other market coming.a world that works for everyone,with no one and nothing left out,then the nonprofit sector has to bea serious part of the conversation.But it doesn't seem to be working.to finding a cure for breast cancer,or our homeless charities not come closeto ending homelessness in any major city?Why has poverty remained stuckAnd the answer is,We have two rulebooks.We have one for the nonprofit sector,It's an apartheid, and it discriminatesthe first being compensation.the more money you can make.But we don't like nonprofits to use moneynot helping other people.trying to cure kids of malaria,and you're considered a parasite yourself.(Applause)has a powerful side effect, which is:or doing good for the world,and sends tens of thousands of peoplefor MBAs 10 years out of business school.to become the CEO of a hunger charity.Not necessarily. They might be smart.It's cheaper for that person to donatesave 50,000 dollars on their taxes --100,000 dollars to charity;indeed, probably supervise the poor SOB(Laughter)and popular praise still ahead of them.I want it go to the needy."As if the money invested in advertisingto serve the needy.In the 1990s, my company createdand over the course of nine years,(Applause)than any events in history,But they have to be asked.We got that many people to participateif we put up fliers in the laundromat?that in 40 years, the nonprofit sectoraway from the for-profit sector.if it isn't really allowed to market?And if we tell the consumer brands,and nobody calls the attorney general.for fear that if the thing fails,Well, you and I knowThe fourth area is time.and people had patience.of building market dominance.no money was going to go to the needy,we would expect a crucifixion.The last area is profit itself.so the for-profit sector has a lockthat the for-profit sector takes;and you've just put the nonprofit sectoron every level.this statistic is sobering:From 1970 to 2009,the number of nonprofits that really grew,is 144.is 46,136.So why do we think this way?these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs.They were pious people,compared to the other colonists.that was a sure path to eternal damnation.What were they to do about this?Well, charity became their answer.It became this economic sanctuary,at five cents on the dollar.and in 400 years, nothing has intervenedI'm going to just focus on two.that it is somehow not part of the cause.creates this second, much larger problem,they really need to grow,in the interest of keeping overhead low.then we have it precisely backwards,because fundraising is the one thingI'll give you two examples.We launched the AIDSRidesWe launched the breast cancer three-daysfor breast cancer research.what would make more sense:and give her 350,000 dollars for research,2002 was our most successful year ever.71 million dollars after all expenses.And then we went out of business,suddenly and traumatically.They wanted to distance themselves from uslost their jobs ...because they were labeled "overhead."The overhead went up.or 60 million dollars, in one year.with 40 percent overhead,What is the actual size of these pies?because it made no investment in its scale71 million dollars because it did?Now which pie would we prefer,That's about 300 billion dollars a year.goes to health and human services causes.to tackle these problems.to health and human services charities,Now we're talking scale.to lower their horizons"We kept charity overhead low."(Laughter)(Applause)and that part of the way we did thatAsk about the scale of their dreams,regardless of what the overhead is.Who cares what the overhead isIf we can have that kind of generosity --a generosity of thought --most desperately in need of it to change.that we took responsibilitythat we revisited it, we revised it,forever, for everyone --Annalisa Smith-Pallotta: That would beSage Smith-Pallotta: a real socialRider Smith-Pallotta: innovation.Dan Pallotta: Thank you very much.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)

(Breathes in)(Breathes out)For about the five years after graduatingthis was my day job.(Laughter)because everybody always wants to know,who are these freaks in real life.(Laughter)Hello.put a hat or a can at my feet,I handed them a flower --and some intense eye contact.And if they didn't take the flower,as they walked away.(Laughter)especially lonely peoplebeing allowed in a city street,And my eyes would say --"Thank you.I see you."And their eyes would say --"Nobody ever sees me.Thank you."I would get harassed sometimes.People would yell at me from their cars."Get a job!"(Laughing) And I'd be, like,"This is my job."But it hurt, because it made me fearand unfair, shameful.for the music business on this box.And for the economists out there,It was consistent.with my band, the Dresden Dolls.This was me on piano, a genius drummer.I wrote the songs, and eventuallyand as we started touring,I really didn't want to lose this senseand they would pass the hat,And then Twitter came along,and made things even more magic,So I would need a piano to practice on,This is in London.People would bring home-cooked food to usThis is in Seattle.Fans who worked in museums and storesThis is a library in Auckland.who says hello.And a nurse from a hospital drove oneright at that moment to the cafe I was in,and I bought her a smoothieAnd I love this kind of random closeness,but there's no wireless,and in punk squats,(Laughter)And that night, her whole familyso that we could take their beds.And I lay there thinking,these people have so little.Is this fair?And in the morning,and wanted to give me a Bible,And I thought, this is fair.This is this.I'm on the Lower East Side,I've always been with my band or my crew.Is this what stupid people do?(Laughter)Is this how stupid people die?She's an artist.He's a financial blogger for Reuters,and they're pouring me a glass of red wineand offering me a bath,I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfingare basically the same thing.You're falling into the audienceand you're trusting each other.I once asked an opening band of mineAnd as usual, the band was psyched,but there was this one guy in the bandAnd I recognized his fearof "Is this fair?"and "Get a job."We sign with a major label.It's not for everybody.Well, maybe it's for you.(Laughter)in the first few weeks,and the label considers this a failure.I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"They said, "No, the sales are going down.It's a failure."And they walk off.and a guy comes up to meand hands me a $10 bill,and he says,(Laughter)I just want you to have this money."And this starts happening all the time.I become the hat after my own gigs,and unlike the guy in the opening band,Thank you.And this is the moment I decideonline whenever possible,Amanda Palmer over here,but I'm going to ask for help,because I saw it work on the street.I turned to crowdfunding.and I asked my crowd to catch me.And the goal was 100,000 dollars.My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,(Applause)And you can see how many people it is.It's about 25,000 people.And the media asked,I asked them.And through the very act of asking people,I'd connected with them,They don't want to ask for things.But it's not easy.It's not easy to ask.Asking makes you vulnerable.And I got a lot of criticism online,after my Kickstarter went big,specifically for asking musiciansAnd this hurt in a really familiar way.And people saying,and they couldn't see the exchangeSo this is slightly not safe for work.(Laughter)I recommend this,(Laughter)because what I was really saying here was,I trust you this much.Should I?Show me.For most of human history,but the Internetare taking us back.and about those people being enough.of no hard sticker price.the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell,I don't see these things as risk.I see them as trust.Now, the online toolsthey're getting there.if we can't face each otherand give and receive fearlessly,but, more important --to ask without shame.My music career has been spentand our fears and our hangovers,our mistakes,and we see each other.And I think when we really see each other,we want to help each other.What if we started asking,"How do we let people pay for music?"Thank you.(Applause)

The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interestin something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics,dating back to at least before Adam Smith.And that is, why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutionscan display radically different savings behavior?Now, many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question,and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headwayand we understand a lot about this.What I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesisand some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working onabout the link between the structure of the language you speakand how you find yourself with the propensity to save.Let me tell you a little bit about savings rates, a little bit about language,and then I'll draw that connection.Let's start by thinking about the member countries of the OECD,or the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.OECD countries, by and large, you should think about theseas the richest, most industrialized countries in the world.And by joining the OECD, they were affirming a common commitmentto democracy, open markets and free trade.Despite all of these similarities, we see huge differences in savings behavior.So all the way over on the left of this graph,what you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year,and some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year.Holding down the right flank of the OECD, all the way on the other side, is Greece.And what you can see is that over the last 25 years,Greece has barely managed to save more than 10 percent of their GDP.It should be noted, of course, that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line.Now that we see these huge differences in savings rates,how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences?Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ.Linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now.And then I'll draw the connection between these two behaviors.Many of you have probably already noticed that I'm Chinese.I grew up in the Midwest of the United States.And something I realized quite early onwas that the Chinese language forced me to speak about and --in fact, more fundamentally than that --ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways.Now, how might that be? Let me give you an example.Suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle.You understood exactly what I just said in English.If we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other, though,I wouldn't have that luxury.I wouldn't have been able to convey so little information.What my language would have forced me to do,instead of just telling you, "This is my uncle,"is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information.My language would force me to tell youwhether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side,whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth,and if this man was my father's brother,whether he was older than or younger than my father.All of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it.And in fact, if I want to speak correctly,Chinese forces me to constantly think about it.Now, that fascinated me endlessly as a child,but what fascinates me even more today as an economistis that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time.So for example, if I'm speaking in English, I have to speak grammatically differentlyif I'm talking about past rain, "It rained yesterday,"current rain, "It is raining now,"or future rain, "It will rain tomorrow."Notice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events.Why? Because I have to consider thatand I have to modify what I'm saying to say, "It will rain," or "It's going to rain."It's simply not permissible in English to say, "It rain tomorrow."In contrast to that, that's almost exactly what you would say in Chinese.A Chinese speaker can basically say somethingthat sounds very strange to an English speaker's ears.They can say, "Yesterday it rain," "Now it rain," "Tomorrow it rain."In some deep sense, Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrumin the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly.Is this difference in languagesonly between very, very distantly related languages, like English and Chinese?Actually, no.So many of you know, in this room, that English is a Germanic language.What you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier.It is the only Germanic language that requires this.For example, most other Germanic language speakersfeel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrowby saying, "Morgen regnet es,"quite literally to an English ear, "It rain tomorrow."This led me, as a behavioral economist, to an intriguing hypothesis.Could how you speak about time, could how your language forces you to think about time,affect your propensity to behave across time?You speak English, a futured language.And what that means is that every time you discuss the future,or any kind of a future event,grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the presentand treat it as if it's something viscerally different.Now suppose that that visceral differencemakes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak.If that's true and it makes the future feellike something more distant and more different from the present,that's going to make it harder to save.If, on the other hand, you speak a futureless language,the present and the future, you speak about them identically.If that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically,that's going to make it easier to save.Now this is a fanciful theory.I'm a professor, I get paid to have fanciful theories.But how would you actually go about testing such a theory?Well, what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature.And interestingly enough, there are pockets of futureless language speakerssituated all over the world.This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe.Interestingly enough, when you start to crank the data,these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the worldturn out to be, by and large, some of the world's best savers.Just to give you a hint of that,let's look back at that OECD graph that we were talking about.What you see is that these bars are systematically tallerand systematically shifted to the leftcompared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages.What is the average difference here?Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year.Over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation.Now while these findings are suggestive,countries can be different in so many different waysthat it's very, very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences.What I'm going to show you, though, is something that I've been engaging in for a year,which is trying to gather all of the largest datasetsthat we have access to as economists,and I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences,hoping to get this relationship to break.And just in summary, no matter how far I push this, I can't get it to break.Let me show you how far you can do that.One way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world.So for example, there is the Survey of Health, [Aging] and Retirement in Europe.From this dataset you actually learn that retired European familiesare extremely patient with survey takers.(Laughter)So imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door."Excuse me, would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio?Do you happen to know how much your house is worth? Do you mind telling me?Would you happen to have a hallway that's more than 10 meters long?If you do, would you mind if I timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway?Would you mind squeezing as hard as you can, in your dominant hand, this deviceso I can measure your grip strength?How about blowing into this tube so I can measure your lung capacity?"The survey takes over a day.(Laughter)Combine that with a Demographic and Health Surveycollected by USAID in developing countries in Africa, for example,which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the HIV statusof families living in, for example, rural Nigeria.Combine that with a world value survey,which measures the political opinions and, fortunately for me, the savings behaviorsof millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world.Take all of that data, combine it, and this map is what you get.What you find is nine countries around the worldthat have significant native populationswhich speak both futureless and futured languages.And what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairsbetween families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure,and then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holdseven after controlling for all of these levels.What are the characteristics we can control for?Well I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence,the demographics -- what sex, their age --their income level within their own country,their educational achievement, a lot about their family structure.It turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe.And most granularly, I break them down by religionwhere there are 72 categories of religions in the world --so an extreme level of granularity.There are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself.Now effectively everything I'm going to tell you from now onis only comparing these basically nearly identical families.It's getting as close as possible to the thought experimentof finding two families both of whom live in Brusselswho are identical on every single one of these dimensions,but one of whom speaks Flemish and one of whom speaks French;or two families that live in a rural district in Nigeria,one of whom speaks Hausa and one of whom speaks Igbo.Now even after all of this granular level of control,do futureless language speakers seem to save more?Yes, futureless language speakers, even after this level of control,are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year.Does this have cumulative effects?Yes, by the time they retire, futureless language speakers, holding constant their income,are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings.Can we push this data even further?Yes, because I just told you, we actually collect a lot of health data as economists.Now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings?Well, think about smoking, for example.Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings.If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure,smoking is just the opposite.It's current pleasure in exchange for future pain.What we should expect then is the opposite effect.And that's exactly what we find.Futureless language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likelyto be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families,and they're going to be 13 to 17 percent less likelyto be obese by the time they retire,and they're going to report being 21 percent more likelyto have used a condom in their last sexual encounter.I could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find.It's almost impossible not to find a savings behaviorfor which this strong effect isn't present.My linguistics and economics colleagues at Yale and I are just starting to do this workand really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudgescause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak.Ultimately, the goal,once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making,we want to be able to provide people toolsso that they can consciously make themselves better saversand more conscious investors in their own future.Thank you very much.(Applause)

"When the crisis came,the serious limitations of existing economicand financial models immediately became apparent.""There is also a strong belief, which I share,that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economicshelped create the crisis."Now, you've probably all heard of similar criticismcoming from people who are skeptical of capitalism.But this is different.This is coming from the heart of finance.The first quote is from Jean-Claude Trichetwhen he was governor of the European Central Bank.The second quote is from the headof the U.K. Financial Services Authority.Are these people implyingthat we don't understand the economic systemsthat drive our modern societies?It gets worse."We spend billions of dollarstrying to understand the origins of the universewhile we still don't understand the conditionsfor a stable society, a functioning economy, or peace."What's happening here? How can this be possible?Do we really understand more about the fabric of realitythan we do about the fabricwhich emerges from our human interactions?Unfortunately, the answer is yes.But there's an intriguing solution which is comingfrom what is known as the science of complexity.To explain what this means and what this thing is,please let me quickly take a couple of steps back.I ended up in physics by accident.It was a random encounter when I was young,and since then, I've often wonderedabout the amazing success of physicsin describing the reality we wake up in every day.In a nutshell, you can think of physics as follows.So you take a chunk of reality you want to understandand you translate it into mathematics.You encode it into equations.Then predictions can be made and tested.We're actually really lucky that this works,because no one really knows why the thoughts in our headsshould actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe.Despite the success, physics has its limits.As Dirk Helbing pointed out in the last quote,we don't really understand the complexitythat relates to us, that surrounds us.This paradox is what got me interested in complex systems.So these are systems which are made upof many interconnected or interacting parts:swarms of birds or fish, ant colonies,ecosystems, brains, financial markets.These are just a few examples.Interestingly, complex systems are very hard to mapinto mathematical equations,so the usual physics approach doesn't really work here.So what do we know about complex systems?Well, it turns out that what looks like complex behaviorfrom the outside is actually the resultof a few simple rules of interaction.This means you can forget about the equationsand just start to understand the systemby looking at the interactions,so you can actually forget about the equationsand you just start to look at the interactions.And it gets even better, because most complex systemshave this amazing property called emergence.So this means that the system as a wholesuddenly starts to show a behaviorwhich cannot be understood or predictedby looking at the components of the system.So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts.And all of this also means that you can forget aboutthe individual parts of the system, how complex they are.So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird,you just focus on the rules of interaction.As a result, networks are ideal representationsof complex systems.The nodes in the networkare the system's componentsand the links are given by the interactions.So what equations are for physics,complex networks are for the study of complex systems.This approach has been very successfully appliedto many complex systems in physics, biology,computer science, the social sciences,but what about economics?Where are economic networks?This is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature.The study we published last year called"The Network of Global Corporate Control"was the first extensive analysis of economic networks.The study went viral on the Internetand it attracted a lot of attention from the international media.This is quite remarkable, because, again,why did no one look at this before?Similar data has been around for quite some time.What we looked at in detail was ownership networks.So here the nodes are companies, people, governments,foundations, etc.And the links represent the shareholding relations,so Shareholder A has x percent of the shares in Company B.And we also assign a value to the companygiven by the operating revenue.So ownership networks reveal the patternsof shareholding relations.In this little example, you can seea few financial institutionswith some of the many links highlighted.Now you may think that no one's looked at this beforebecause ownership networks arereally, really boring to study.Well, as ownership is related to control,as I shall explain later,looking at ownership networksactually can give you answers to questions like,who are the key players?How are they organized? Are they isolated?Are they interconnected?And what is the overall distribution of control?In other words, who controls the world?I think this is an interesting question.And it has implications for systemic risk.This is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall.A high degree of interconnectivitycan be bad for stability,because then the stress can spread through the systemlike an epidemic.Scientists have sometimes criticized economistswho believe ideas and conceptsare more important than empirical data,because a foundational guideline in science is:Let the data speak. Okay. Let's do that.So we started with a database containing13 million ownership relations from 2007.This is a lot of data, and because we wanted to find outwho rules the world,we decided to focus on transnational corporations,or TNCs for short.These are companies that operate in more than one country,and we found 43,000.In the next step, we built the network around these companies,so we took all the TNCs' shareholders,and the shareholders' shareholders, etc.,all the way upstream, and we did the same downstream,and ended up with a network containing 600,000 nodesand one million links.This is the TNC network which we analyzed.And it turns out to be structured as follows.So you have a periphery and a centerwhich contains about 75 percent of all the players,and in the center there's this tiny but dominant corewhich is made up of highly interconnected companies.To give you a better picture,think about a metropolitan area.So you have the suburbs and the periphery,you have a center like a financial district,then the core will be something likethe tallest high rise building in the center.And we already see signs of organization going on here.Thirty-six percent of the TNCs are in the core only,but they make up 95 percent of the total operating revenueof all TNCs.Okay, so now we analyzed the structure,so how does this relate to the control?Well, ownership gives voting rights to shareholders.This is the normal notion of control.And there are different models which allow you to computethe control you get from ownership.If you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company,you get control,but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares.And the network really matters.About 10 years ago, Mr. Tronchetti Proverahad ownership and control in a small company,which had ownership and control in a bigger company.You get the idea.This ended up giving him control in Telecom Italiawith a leverage of 26.So this means that, with each euro he invested,he was able to move 26 euros of market valuethrough the chain of ownership relations.Now what we actually computed in our studywas the control over the TNCs' value.This allowed us to assign a degree of influenceto each shareholder.This is very much in the sense ofMax Weber's idea of potential power,which is the probability of imposing one's own willdespite the opposition of others.If you want to compute the flow in an ownership network,this is what you have to do.It's actually not that hard to understand.Let me explain by giving you this analogy.So think about water flowing in pipeswhere the pipes have different thickness.So similarly, the control is flowing in the ownership networksand is accumulating at the nodes.So what did we find after computing all this network control?Well, it turns out that the 737 top shareholdershave the potential to collectively control80 percent of the TNCs' value.Now remember, we started out with 600,000 nodes,so these 737 top playersmake up a bit more than 0.1 percent.They're mostly financial institutions in the U.S. and the U.K.And it gets even more extreme.There are 146 top players in the core,and they together have the potential to collectively control40 percent of the TNCs' value.What should you take home from all of this?Well, the high degree of control you sawis very extreme by any standard.The high degree of interconnectivityof the top players in the corecould pose a significant systemic risk to the global economyand we could easily reproduce the TNC networkwith a few simple rules.This means that its structure is probably the resultof self-organization.It's an emergent property which dependson the rules of interaction in the system,so it's probably not the result of a top-down approachlike a global conspiracy.Our study "is an impression of the moon's surface.It's not a street map."So you should take the exact numbers in our studywith a grain of salt,yet it "gave us a tantalizing glimpseof a brave new world of finance."We hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction,so the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future.And this is slowly starting.We're seeing the emergence of long-termand highly-funded programs which aim at understandingour networked world from a complexity point of view.But this journey has only just begun,so we will have to wait before we see the first results.Now there is still a big problem, in my opinion.Ideas relating to finance, economics, politics,society, are very often taintedby people's personal ideologies.I really hope that this complexity perspectiveallows for some common ground to be found.It would be really great if it has the powerto help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas,which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world.Reality is so complex, we need to move away from dogma.But this is just my own personal ideology.Thank you.(Applause)

This is about a hidden corner of the labor market.It's the world of people who need to work ultra-flexibly,if they're to work at all.So think, for instance,of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition,or somebody who's caring for a dependent adult,or a parent with complex child care needs.Their availability for work can be such that it's,"A few hours today.Maybe I can work tomorrow, but I don't know if and when yet."And it's extraordinarily difficult for these peopleto find the work that they so often need very badly.Which is a tragedy because there are employerswho can use pools of very flexible local peoplebooked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work.Imagine that you run a cafe.It's mid-morning, the place is filling up.You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush.If you could get two extra workers for 90 minutesto start in an hour's time,you'd do it, but they'd have to be reliable, inducted in how your cafe works.They'd have to be available at very competitive rates.They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute.In reality, no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business,so you are going to muddle by, understaffed.And it's not just caterers, it's hoteliers, it's retailers,it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses.There's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people,possibly already once they've been inducted.At this level of the labor market,what you need is a marketplace for spare hours.They do exist. Here's how they work.So in this example, a distribution company has said,we've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning.Show us everyone who's available.It's found 31 workers.Everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow.They're all contactable in time for this booking.They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings.And this booking is within all the parameters for each individual.And they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking.Of course, they're all trained to work in warehouses.You can select as many of them as you want.They're from multiple agencies.It's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking.And it's monitoring their reliability.The people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones.They're likely to be more expensive.In an alternative view of this pool of local, very flexible people,here's a market research company,and it's inducted maybe 25 local people in how to do street interviewing.And they've got a new campaign. They want to run it next week.And they're looking at how many of the people they've inductedare available each hour next week.And they'll then decide when to do their street interviews.But is there more that could be donefor this corner of the labor market?Because right now there are so many peoplewho need whatever economic opportunity they can get.Let's make it personal.Imagine that a young woman -- base of the economic pyramid,very little prospect of getting a job --what economic activity could she theoretically engage in?Well, she might be willing to work odd hoursin a call center, in a reception area, in a mail room.She may be interested in providing local services to her community:babysitting, local deliveries, pet care.She may have possessions that she would like to tradeat times she doesn't need them.So she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out.She might have a bike, a video games console she only uses occasionally.And you're probably thinking -- because you're all very web-aware --yes, and we're in the era of collaborative consumption,so she can go online and do all this.She can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed,she can go to TaskRabbit.com and say, "I want to do local deliveries," and so on.These are good sites, but I believe we can go a step further.And the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all.Markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years,but only for organizations at the top of the economy.If you're a Wall Street trader, you now take it for grantedthat you sell your financial assets in a system of marketsthat identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time,executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set.It analyzes supply and demand and pricingand tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from.It manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways.It's all extremely low overhead.What have we gained at the bottom of the economyin terms of markets in the last 20 years?Basically classified adverts with a search facility.So why do we have this disparitybetween these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economythat are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resourceout of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading,and what the rest of us have?A modern market is more than a website;it's a web of interoperable marketplaces,back office mechanisms, regulatory regimes,settlement mechanisms, liquidity sources and so on.And when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning,she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell todayand then post that listing on multiple websitesand wait for potential buyers to get in touchand start negotiating the terms on which she might trade.In the early days of this modern markets technology,the financial institutions worked outhow they could leverage their buying power, their back office processes,their relationships, their networksto shape these new markets that would create all this new activity.They asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes,and in a lot of cases they got it.But throughout the economy,there are facilities that could likewise leveragea new generation of marketsfor the benefit of all of us.And those facilities --I'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity,the licensing authoritiesthat know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time,the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels.These mechanisms, these facilitiesare not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo,they're controlled by the state.And the policymakers who sit on top of themare, I suggest, simply not thinking about how those facilities could be usedto underpin a whole new era of markets.Like everyone else, those policymakers are taking it for grantedthat modern markets are the preserveof organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves.Suppose we stopped taking that for granted.Suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S.,or the leader of any other developed nation,woke up and said, "I'm never going to be able to createall the jobs I need in the current climate.I have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens.And for that they have to be able to access state-of-the-art markets.How do I make that happen?"And I think I can see a few eyes rolling.Politicians in a big, complex, sophisticated I.T. project?Oh, that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen.Not necessarily.There is a precedent for technology-enabled servicethat has been initiated by politicians in multiple countriesand has been hugely successful:national lotteries.Let's take Britain as an example.Our government didn't design the national lottery,it didn't fund the national lottery, it doesn't operate the national lottery.It simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed.This act defines what a national lottery will look like.It specifies certain benefitsthat the state can uniquely bestow on the operators.And it puts some obligations on those operators.In terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses,this was an unqualified success.But let's suppose that our aimis to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid.Could we use the same model?I believe we could.So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility.Let's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short.Think of it as a regulated public utility.So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network.And it's a series of markets for low-level tradethat can be fulfilled by a person or a small company.And government has certain benefitsit can uniquely bestow on these markets.It's about public spending going through these marketsto buy public services at the local level.It's about interfacing these marketsdirect into the highest official channels in the land.It's about enshrining government's role as a publicist for these markets.It's about deregulating some sectorsso that local people can enter them.So, taxi journeys might be one example.And there are certain obligations that should go with those benefitsto be placed on the operators,and the key one is, of course,that the operators pay for everything,including all the interfacing into the public sector.So imagine that the operators make their returnby building a percentage markup into each transaction.Imagine that there's a concession perioddefined of maybe 15 yearsin which they can take all these benefits and run with them.And imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told,whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transactionto fund the whole thingwill get the deal.So government then exits the frame.This is now in the hands of the consortium.Either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunityand make a percentage on all of itor it's all going to crash and burn,which is tough on their shareholders.It doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily.And there would be no constraints on alternative markets.So this would just be one more choiceamong millions of Internet forums.But it could be very different,because having access to those state-backed facilitiescould incentivize this consortiumto seriously invest in the service.Because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions goingto start making their return.So we're talking about sectors like home hair care,the hire of toys, farm work,hire of clothes even, meals delivered to your door,services for tourists, home care.This would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed,because national e-markets will deliver data.So this is a local personpotentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market.And they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and trainingif they wanted to go into that market.They'd have to do assessment interviews with local parentswho wanted a pool of babysitters.Is it worth their while?Should they be looking at other sectors?Should they be moving to another part of the countrywhere there's a shortage of babysitters?This kind of data can become routine.And this data can be used by investors.So if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the countryand the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training,an investor can pay for itand the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individualsfor maybe the next two years.This is a world of atomized capitalism.So it's small trades by small people,but it's very informed, safe, convenient, low-overhead and immediate.Some rough research suggests this could unlockaround 100 million pounds' worth a day of new economic activityin a country the size of the U.K.Does that sound improbable to you?That's what a lot of people said about turbo tradingin financial exchanges 20 years ago.Do not underestimate the transformative powerof truly modern markets.Thank you.(Applause)

Twelve years ago, I founded Zipcar.Zipcar buys cars and parks themthroughout dense metropolitan areasfor people to use, by the hour and by the day,instead of owning their own cars.Each Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars,and each driver drives about 80 percent lessbecause they're now paying the full cost,all at once, in real time.But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.Now, a decade later, it's really time to push the envelope a little bit,and so a couple years ago I moved to Pariswith my husband and youngest child,and we launched Buzzcar a year ago.Buzzcar lets people rent out their own carsto their friends and neighbors.Instead of investing in a car, we invest in a community.We bring the power of a corporationto individuals who add their cars to the network.Some people call this peer-to-peer.This does express the humanity of what's going on,and the personal relationships,but that is also like saying that it's the same thingas a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting.That's peer-to-peer.It's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay,or craft fairs are the same thing as Etsy.But what's really happening is that we've got the powerof a free and open Internet,and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation,and the peers are now in partnership with the company,creating shared value on shared values,and each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.I call this Peers, Inc.The incorporated side, the company,is doing things that it does really well.What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale,significant and long-term resource investment,the expertise of many different kinds of peopleand different kinds of minds, and for individuals,consumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recoursethat we really want as consumers,and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise,and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation.Peers are giving and doing thingsthat are incredibly expensive for companies to do.What do they bring? They bring this fabulous diversity,expensive for companies. And what does that deliver?It delivers localization and customization,specialization, and all of this aspect about social networksand how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there?It's natural for me. Me and my friends, I can connect to them easily.And it also delivers really fabulous innovation,and I'll talk about that later.So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product,and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do.The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds.Some of my favorite examples:in transportation, Carpooling.com. Ten years old,three and a half million people have joined up,and a million rides are shared every day.It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalentof 2,500 TGV trains,and just think, they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car.This is all happening with excess capacity.And it's not just with transportation, my love,but of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com.I met these founders just weeks after they had launched,and now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars?Seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years,what people would do for five dollars.And not just easy things that anyone can do.This Peers, Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm.TopCoder has 400,000 engineers who are deliveringcomplex design and engineering services.When I talked to their CEO, he had this great line.He said, "We have a community that owns its own company."And then my all-time favorite, Etsy.Etsy is providing goods that people make themselvesand they're selling it in a marketplace.It just celebrated its seventh anniversary,and after seven years, last year it delivered530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individualswho have been making those objects.I know you guys out there who are businesspeople,are thinking, "Oh my God, I want to build one of those.I see this incredible speed and scale.You mean all I have to do is build a platform and all these people are goingto put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in?"Building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do.I think of the difference of Google Video versus YouTube.Who would have thought that two young guys and a start-upwould beat out Google Video? Why?I actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them.But I'm thinking, you know, they probably hadthe "share" button a little bit brighter and to the right,and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sidesthat are always participating on these networks.So I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now,and a Peers, Inc. company, because I've spentthe last two years doing that in Paris.So let me take you back how it's so incredibly differentbuilding Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar,because now every single thing we do has these twodifferent bodies that I have to be thinking about:the owners who are going to provide the carsand the drivers who are going to rent them.Every single decision, I have to think about what is right for both sides.There are many, many examples and I'll give you onethat is not my favorite example: insurance.It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right.Hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companiesand their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative,they'd never thought of it before.Way too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers,trying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom,and the result was that we were able to provide ownersprotection for their own driving records and their own history.The cars are completely insured during the rental,and it gives drivers what they need, and what do they need?They need a low deductible,and 24-hour roadside assistance.So this was a trick to get these two sides.So now I want to take you to the moment of --When you're an entrepreneur, and you've started a new company,there's the, here's all the stuff we do beforehand,and then the service launches. What happens?So all those months of work, they come into play.Last June 1, we launched. It was an exciting moment.And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting.All the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent.The reservations start coming in, and here,owners who were getting text messages and emailsthat said, "Hey, Joe wants to rent your car for the weekend.You can earn 60 euros. Isn't that great? Yes or no?"No reply. Like, a huge proportion of themcouldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply.So I thought, "Duh, Robin, this is the difference betweenindustrial production and peer production."Industrial production, the whole point of industrial productionis to provide a standardized, exact service modelthat is consistent every single time,and I'm really thankful that my smartphone is madeusing industrial production.And Zipcar provides a very nice, consistent servicethat works fabulously.But what does peer production do? Peer productionis this completely different way of doing things,and you have a big quality range, and so eBay, cleverly,the first peer production, Peer, Inc. company, I'd say,they figured out early on, we need to have ratingsand commentaries and all that yucky side stuff.We can flag that and we can put it to the side, and peoplewho are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it.So going back, this is my look of excitement and joy,because all this stuff that I'd also been hoping foractually really did happen, and what's that?That is the diversity of what's going on.You have these different fabulous ownersand their different cars, different prices,different locations. (Laughter)They dress differently, and they look different,and, really, I love these photos every time I look at them.Cool guys, excited guys,and here is Selma, who -- I love this driver.And after a year, we have 1,000 carsthat are parked across France and 6,000 peoplewho are members and eager to drive them.This would not be possible to do that in economic fashionfor a traditional company.Back to this spectrum.So what's happening is, we had the yuck side,but we actually had this real wow side.And I can tell you two great stories.A driver was telling me that they went to rent a carto go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them,and said, "You know what, here's where the cliffs are,and here's all the beaches, and this is my best beach,and this is where the best fish restaurant is."And the peers also become,peers and owners create relationships,and so at the last minute people can --a driver can say, "Hey, you know what, I really need the car,is it available?" And that person will say,"Sure, my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it."So you can have these really nice things that can't happen,and it's a kind of "Wow!" and I want to say "Wow!"type of thing that's happening here, because individuals,if you're a company, what happens is you might have10 people who are in charge of innovation,or 100 people who are in charge of innovation.What happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you havetens and hundreds and thousands and even millionsof people who are creating experiments on this model,and so out of all that influence and that effort,you are having this exceptional amount of innovationthat is coming out.So one of the reasons, if we come back to why did Icall it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of usabout the power of the hive,and its incredible facility to create this platformthat individuals want to participate and innovate on.And for me, when I think about our future,and all of those problems that seem incredibly large,the scale is impossible, the urgency is there,Peers, Inc. provides the speed and scaleand the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems.All we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation -- nontrivial.So I continue to think thattransportation is the center of the hard universe.All problems come back to transportation for me.But there are all these other areas that are these profound,big problems that I know that we can work on,and people are working on them in many different sectors,but there's this really fabulous group of thingswith the power of this Peers, Inc. model.So over the last decade, we've been reveling inthe power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals,and for me, what Peers, Inc. doesis it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the powerof the company and the corporationand supercharging individuals.So for me, it's a collaboration.Together, we can. (Applause)Thank you. (Applause)

In 2002, a group of treatment activists metto discuss the early development of the airplane.The Wright Brothers, in the beginning of the last century,had for the first time managedto make one of those devices fly.They also had taken out numerous patentson essential parts of the airplane.They were not the only ones.That was common practice in the industry,and those who held patents on airplaneswere defending them fiercelyand suing competitors left and right.This actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry,and this was at a time that in particular the U.S. governmentwas interested in ramping upthe production of military airplanes.So there was a bit of a conflict there.The U.S. government decided to take action,and forced those patent holdersto make their patents available to share with othersto enable the production of airplanes.So what has thisgot to do with this?In 2002, Nelson Otwoma, a Kenyan social scientist,discovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment.He was told that a cure did not exist.AIDS, he heard, was lethal,and treatment was not offered. This was at a timethat treatment actually existed in rich countries.AIDS had become a chronic disease.People in our countries here in Europe, in North America,were living with HIV, healthy lives.Not so for Nelson. He wasn't rich enough,and not so for his three-year-old son, who he discovered a year lateralso had HIV.Nelson decided to become a treatment activistand join up with other groups.In 2002, they were facing a different battle.Prices for ARVs, the drugs needed to treat HIV,cost about 12,000 [dollars] per patient per year.The patents on those drugs were heldby a number of Western pharmaceutical companiesthat were not necessarily willingto make those patents available.When you have a patent, you can excludeanyone else from making, from producing or makinglow-cost versions, for example,available of those medications.Clearly this led to patent wars breaking outall over the globe.Luckily, those patents did not exist everywhere.There were countries that did not recognizepharmaceutical product patents, such as India,and Indian pharmaceutical companiesstarted to produce so-called generic versions,low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines,and make them available in the developing world,and within a year the price had come downfrom 10,000 dollars per patient per yearto 350 dollars per patient per year,and today that same triple pill cocktailis available for 60 dollars per patient per year,and of course that started to have an enormous effecton the number of people who could afford accessto those medicines.Treatment programs became possible,funding became available, and the number of peopleon antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly.Today, eight million peoplehave access to antiretroviral drugs.Thirty-four million are infected with HIV.Never has this number been so high,but actually this is good news,because what it means is people stop dying.People who have access to these drugs stop dying.And there's something else.They also stop passing on the virus.This is fairly recent science that has shown that.What that means is we have the toolsto break the back of this epidemic.So what's the problem?Well, things have changed.First of all, the rules have changed.Today, all countries are obliged to providepatents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years.This is as a result of the intellectual property rulesof the World Trade Organization.So what India did is no longer possible.Second, the practice of patent-holding companies have changed.Here you see the patent practicesbefore the World Trade Organization's rules, before '95,before antiretroviral drugs.This is what you see today,and this is in developing countries, so what that means is,unless we do something deliberateand unless we do something now,we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis,because new drugs are developed,new drugs go to market, but these medicines are patentedin a much wider range of countries.So unless we act, unless we do something today,we will soon be faced [with] what some have termedthe treatment time bomb.It isn't only the number of drugs that are patented.There's something else that can really scaregeneric manufacturers away.This shows you a patent landscape.This is the landscape of one medicine.So you can imagine that if you are a generic companyabout to decide whether to investin the development of this product, unless you knowthat the licenses to these patentsare actually going to be available,you will probably choose to do something else.Again, deliberate action is needed.So surelyif a patent pool could be establishedto ramp up the production of military airplanes,we should be able to do something similarto tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.And we did.In 2010, UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Poolfor HIV.And this is how it works:Patent holders, inventorsthat develop new medicinespatent those inventions,but make those patents availableto the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Poolthen license those out to whoever needs access to those patents.That can be generic manufacturers.It can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies,for example.Those manufacturers can then sell those medicinesat much lower cost to people who need access to them,to treatment programs that need access to them.They pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders,so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property.There is one key differencewith the airplane patent pool.The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism.The airplane patent holders were not left a choicewhether they'd license their patents or not.They were forced to do so.That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do.It relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companiesto license their patents and make them availablefor others to use.Today, Nelson Otwoma is healthy.He has access to antiretroviral drugs.His son will soon be 14 years old.Nelson is a member of the expert advisory groupof the Medicines Patent Pool,and he told me not so long ago,"Ellen, we rely in Kenya and in many other countrieson the Medicines Patent Pool to make surethat new medicines also become available to us,that new medicines, without delay, become available to us."And this is no longer fantasy.Already, I'll give you an example.In August of this year, the United States drug agencyapproved a new four-in-one AIDS medication.The company, Gilead, that holds the patents,has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool.The pool is already working today, two months later,with generic manufacturers to make sure that this productcan go to market at low costwhere and when it is needed. This is unprecedented.This has never been done before.The rule is about a 10-year delay for a new productto go to market in developing countries, if at all.This has never been seen before.Nelson's expectations are very high,and quite rightly so. He and his son will need accessto the next generation of antiretroviralsand the next, throughout their lifetime,so that he and many others in Kenya and other countriescan continue to live healthy, active lives.Now we count on the willingness of drug companiesto make that happen. We count on those companiesthat understand that it is in the interest, not only in the interestof the global good, but also in their own interest,to move from conflict to collaboration,and through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen.They can also choose not to do that,but those that go down that road may end upin a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up withearly last century, facing forcible measuresby government. So they'd better jump now.Thank you. (Applause)



jeff_smith_lessons_in_business_from_prison

B.J. was one of many fellow inmateswho had big plans for the future.He had a vision. When he got out,he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight,and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.He'd spent 10,000 dollarsto buy a website that exclusively featured womenhaving sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars. (Laughter)It was my first week in federal prison,and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious menwhose business instincts were in many casesas sharp as those of the CEOswho had wined and dined me six months earlierwhen I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up withhad been drug dealers on the outside,but when they talked about what they did,they talked about it in a different jargon,but the business concepts that they talked aboutweren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton:promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user,focus-grouping new product launches,territorial expansion.But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.It's a lot harder than you might think.Contrary to what most people think,people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your lifewhen you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life.You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant,toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.And it's hard for a couple of reasons.First, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percentfrom what you'd pay on the street,and second, you don't make a lot of money.I unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job,unloading trucks at a food warehouse,for $5.25, not an hour, but per month.So how do you survive?Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.There's legal hustles.You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.You charge another inmate to clean his cell.There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in,you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography,cell phones, and just as in the outer world,there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise,the more profitable it can potentially be.You want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars.You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip openand is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks.You want a dirty magazine?Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.So as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspectsof prison life is ingenuity.Whether it was concocting delicious mealsfrom stolen scraps from the warehouse,sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers,or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bagstied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less,and many of them want to take this ingenuitythat they've learned to the outsideand start restaurants, barber shops,personal training businesses.But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that,no rehabilitation at all in prison,no one to help them write a business plan,figure out a way to translate the business conceptsthey intuitively grasp into legal enterprises,no access to the Internet, even.And then, when they come out, most statesdon't even have a law prohibiting employersfrom discriminating against people with a background.So none of us should be surprisedthat two out of three ex-offenders re-offendwithin five years.Look, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.But when I came out, I vowed that I was going to dowhatever I could to make surethat guys like the ones I was locked up withdidn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.The best thing we can do is figure out waysto nurture the entrepreneurial spiritand the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons,because if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skillsthat's going to help them, and they'll be right back.All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.Thank you. (Applause)

So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopoand Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema.Water and electricity supply are as unpredictableas the weather, and growing up in these tough situations,at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friendsof mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.So as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says,"Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you canjust put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?"And I sat, and I was like, "Man, I would buy that, eh?"So I went home, and I did a little research,and I found some very shocking statistics.Over 2.5 billion people in the world todaydo not have proper access to water and sanitation.Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa,and five million of them are in South Africa.Various diseases thrive in this environment,the most drastic of which is called trachoma.Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirtgetting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachomacan leave you permanently blind.The disease leaves eight million people permanently blindeach and every year. The shocking part about itis that to avoid being infected with trachoma,all you have to do is wash your face:no medicine, no pills, no injections.So after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself,"Okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myselfand the fact that I don't want to bathe, I at least needto do it to try to save the world." (Laughter)So with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone --I didn't have a laptop, I didn't have Internet much,except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe —I did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions,creams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities --I did high school science --and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper,and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know?So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.Now we need to get this thing into practice.Fast forward four years later, after having writtena 40-page business plan on the cell phone,having written my patent on the cell phone,I'm the youngest patent-holder in the country,and — ("No more bathing!") —I can't say any more than that. (Laughter)I had invented DryBath, the world's firstbath-substituting lotion.You literally put it on your skin, and you don't have to bathe.(Laughter)So after having tried to make it work in high schoolwith the limited resources I had, I went to university,met a few people, got it into practice,and we have a fully functioning product that's readyto go to the market. It's actually available on the market.So we learned a few lessons in commercializingand making DryBath available.One of the things we learned was that poor communitiesdon't buy products in bulk.They buy products on demand. A person in Alexdoesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigaretteeach day, even though it's more expensive.So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.And the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bathfor five rand.After creating that model, we also learned a lotin terms of implementing the product.We realized that even rich kids from the suburbsreally want DryBath. (Laughter)At least once a week.Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million litersof water on average each time they skipped a bath,and also we would save two hours a day for kidswho are in rural areas, two hours more for school,two hours more for homework,two hours more to just be a kid.After seeing that global impact, we narrowed it downto our key value proposition,which was cleanliness and convenience.DryBath is a rich man's convenienceand a poor man's lifesaver.Having put the product into practice, we are actually nowon the verge of selling the productonto a multinational to take it to the retail market,and one question I have for the audience today is,on the gravel roads of Limpopo,with an allowance of 50 rand a week,I came up with a way for the world not to bathe.What's stopping you? (Applause)I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet.And another key thing that I learned a lotthroughout this whole process,last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.I'm also currently the best student entrepreneurin the world, the first African to get that accolade,and one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of thisjust because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you.(Applause.)

Everything I do, and everything I do professionally --my life -- has been shapedby seven years of work as a young man in Africa.From 1971 to 1977 --I look young, but I'm not — (Laughter) --I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia,in projects of technical cooperation with African countries.I worked for an Italian NGO,and every single project that we set up in Africafailed.And I was distraught.I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good peopleand we were doing good work in Africa.Instead, everything we touched we killed.Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book,"Ripples from the Zambezi,"was a project where we Italiansdecided to teach Zambian people how to grow food.So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambiain this absolutely magnificent valleygoing down to the Zambezi River,and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoesand zucchini and ...And of course the local people had absolutely no interestin doing that, so we paid them to come and work,and sometimes they would show up. (Laughter)And we were amazed that the local people,in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.But instead of asking them how come they were notgrowing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." (Laughter)"Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation."And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully.We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomatowould grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians,"Look how easy agriculture is."When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red,overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the riverand they ate everything. (Laughter)And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!"And the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." (Laughter)"Why didn't you tell us?""You never asked."I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa,but then I saw what the Americans were doing,what the English were doing, what the French were doing,and after seeing what they were doing,I became quite proud of our project in Zambia.Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos.You should see the rubbish — (Applause) --You should see the rubbish that we have bestowedon unsuspecting African people.You want to read the book,read "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo,Zambian woman economist.The book was published in 2009.We Western donor countries have given the African continenttwo trillion American dollars in the last 50 years.I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done.Just go and read her book.Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done.We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries,and there are only two ways we deal with people:We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic.The two words come from the Latin root "pater,"which means "father."But they mean two different things.Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different cultureas if they were my children. "I love you so much."Patronizing, I treat everybody from another cultureas if they were my servants.That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss.I was given a slap in the face reading a book,"Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said,above all in economic development, if peopledo not wish to be helped, leave them alone.This should be the first principle of aid.The first principle of aid is respect.This morning, the gentleman who opened this conferencelay a stick on the floor, and said,"Can we -- can you imagine a citythat is not neocolonial?"I decided when I was 27 years oldto only respond to people,and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation,where you never initiate anything,you never motivate anybody, but you become a servantof the local passion, the servant of local peoplewho have a dream to become a better person.So what you do -- you shut up.You never arrive in a community with any ideas,and you sit with the local people.We don't work from offices.We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub.We have zero infrastructure.And what we do, we become friends,and we find out what that person wants to do.The most important thing is passion.You can give somebody an idea.If that person doesn't want to do it,what are you going to do?The passion that the person has for her own growthis the most important thing.The passion that that man has for his own personal growthis the most important thing.And then we help them to go and find the knowledge,because nobody in the world can succeed alone.The person with the idea may not have the knowledge,but the knowledge is available.So years and years ago, I had this idea:Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the communityto tell people what to do, why don't, for once,listen to them? But not in community meetings.Let me tell you a secret.There is a problem with community meetings.Entrepreneurs never come,and they never tell you, in a public meeting,what they want to do with their own money,what opportunity they have identified.So planning has this blind spot.The smartest people in your community you don't even know,because they don't come to your public meetings.What we do, we work one-on-one,and to work one-on-one, you have to createa social infrastructure that doesn't exist.You have to create a new profession.The profession is the family doctor of enterprise,the family doctor of business, who sits with youin your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe,and helps you find the resources to transform your passioninto a way to make a living.I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia.I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time,trying to go away from this patronizing bullshitthat we arrive and tell you what to do.And so what I did in Esperance that first yearwas to just walk the streets, and in three daysI had my first client, and I helped this first guywho was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy,and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth,to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say,"You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?"And I helped these five fishermen to work togetherand get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albanyfor 60 cents a kilo, but we found a wayto take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo,and the farmers came to talk to me, said,"Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"In a year, I had 27 projects going on,and the government came to see me to say,"How can you do that?How can you do — ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult.I shut up, and listen to them." (Laughter)So — (Applause) —So the government says, "Do it again." (Laughter)We've done it in 300 communities around the world.We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.There is a new generation of entrepreneurswho are dying of solitude.Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history,died age 96, a few years ago.Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophybefore becoming involved in business,and this is what Peter Drucker says:"Planning is actually incompatiblewith an entrepreneurial society and economy."Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship.So now you're rebuilding Christchurchwithout knowing what the smartest people in Christchurchwant to do with their own money and their own energy.You have to learn how to get these peopleto come and talk to you.You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy,you have to be fantastic at helping them,and then they will come, and they will come in droves.In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people,the intelligence and the passion?Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning?Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded.So what I'm saying is thatentrepreneurship is where it's at.We are at the end of the first industrial revolution --nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing --and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable.The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable.What we have to look at is at how wefeed, cure, educate, transport, communicatefor seven billion people in a sustainable way.The technologies do not exist to do that.Who is going to invent the technologyfor the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it!Government? Forget about it!It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazinemany, many years ago.There was a group of experts who were invitedto discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.And in 1860, this group of people came together,and they all speculated about what would happento the city of New York in 100 years,and the conclusion was unanimous:The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.Why? Because they looked at the curve and said,if the population keeps growing at this rate,to move the population of New York around,they would have needed six million horses,and the manure created by six million horseswould be impossible to deal with.They were already drowning in manure. (Laughter)So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technologythat is going to choke the life out of New York.So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900,in the United States of America, there were 1,001car manufacturing companies -- 1,001.The idea of finding a different technologyhad absolutely taken over,and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters.Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.First, you have to offer them confidentiality.Otherwise they don't come and talk to you.Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated,passionate service to them.And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship.The smallest company, the biggest company,has to be capable of doing three things beautifully:The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic,you have to have fantastic marketing,and you have to have tremendous financial management.Guess what?We have never met a single human beingin the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money.It doesn't exist.This person has never been born.We've done the research, and we have lookedat the 100 iconic companies of the world --Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford,all the new companies, Google, Yahoo.There's only one thing that all the successful companiesin the world have in common, only one:None were started by one person.Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-oldsin Northumberland, and we start the classby giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography,and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline,in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiographyhow many times Richard uses the word "I"and how many times he uses the word "we."Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times.He wasn't alone when he started.Nobody started a company alone. No one.So we can create the communitywhere we have facilitators who come from a small business backgroundsitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddieswho will do to you, what somebody did for this gentlemanwho talks about this epic,somebody who will say to you, "What do you need?What can you do? Can you make it?Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?""Oh, no, I cannot do this.""Would you like me to find you somebody?"We activate communities.We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitatorto help you to find resources and peopleand we have discovered that the miracleof the intelligence of local people is suchthat you can change the culture and the economyof this community just by capturing the passion,the energy and imagination of your own people.Thank you.

I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are,how globalized we aren't,and why it's important to actually be accuratein making those kinds of assessments.And the leading point of view on this, whether measuredby number of books sold, mentions in media,or surveys that I've run with groups ranging frommy students to delegates to the World Trade Organization,is this view that national bordersreally don't matter very much anymore,cross-border integration is close to complete,and we live in one world.And what's interesting about this viewis, again, it's a view that's held by pro-globalizerslike Tom Friedman, from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted,but it's also held by anti-globalizers, who see this giantglobalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our livesif it hasn't already done so.The other thing I would add is that this is not a new view.I'm a little bit of an amateur historian, so I've spentsome time going back, trying to see the first mentionof this kind of thing. And the best, earliest quotethat I could find was one from David Livingstone,writing in the 1850s about how the railroad, the steam ship,and the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectlywith the rest of the world.Now clearly, David Livingstonewas a little bit ahead of his time,but it does seem useful to ask ourselves,"Just how global are we?"before we think about where we go from here.So the best way I've found of trying to get peopleto take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat,may not even be close to flat, is with some data.So one of the things I've been doing over the last few yearsis really compiling data on things that could either happenwithin national borders or across national borders,and I've looked at the cross-border componentas a percentage of the total.I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today,but let me just give you a few data points.I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow,one kind of flow of people, one kind of flow of capital,and, of course, trade in products and services.So let's start off with plain old telephone service.Of all the voice-calling minutes in the world last year,what percentage do you think were accounted forby cross-border phone calls?Pick a percentage in your own mind.The answer turns out to be two percent.If you include Internet telephony, you might be ableto push this number up to six or seven percent,but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate.Or let's turn to people moving across borders.One particular thing we might look at, in terms oflong-term flows of people, is what percentageof the world's population is accounted forby first-generation immigrants?Again, please pick a percentage.Turns out to be a little bit higher.It's actually about three percent.Or think of investment. Take all the real investmentthat went on in the world in 2010.What percentage of that was accounted forby foreign direct investment?Not quite ten percent.And then finally, the one statisticthat I suspect many of the people in this room have seen:the export-to-GDP ratio.If you look at the official statistics, they typically indicatea little bit above 30 percent.However, there's a big problem with the official statistics,in that if, for instance, a Japanese component supplierships something to China to be put into an iPod,and then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S.,that component ends up getting counted multiple times.So nobody knows how bad this biaswith the official statistics actually is, so I thought I wouldask the person who's spearheading the effortto generate data on this, Pascal Lamy,the Director of the World Trade Organization,what his best guess would beof exports as a percentage of GDP,without the double- and triple-counting,and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent, rather thanthe 30 percent-plus numbers that we're talking about.So it's very clear that if you look at these numbersor all the other numbers that I talk about in my book,"World 3.0," that we're very, very far fromthe no-border effect benchmark, which would implyinternationalization levels of the order of 85, 90, 95 percent.So clearly, apocalyptically-minded authorshave overstated the case.But it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them,who are prone to this kind of overstatement.I've also spent some time surveying audiencesin different parts of the worldon what they actually guess these numbers to be.Let me share with you the results of a surveythat Harvard Business Review was kind enough to runof its readership as to what people's guessesalong these dimensions actually were.So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide.First of all, there is a suggestion of some error.Okay. (Laughter)Second, these are pretty large errors. For four quantitieswhose average value is less than 10 percent,you have people guessing three, four times that level.Even though I'm an economist, I find thata pretty large error.And third, this is not just confined to the readersof the Harvard Business Review.I've run several dozen such surveys in different partsof the world, and in all cases except one,where a group actually underestimatedthe trade-to-GDP ratio, people have this tendencytowards overestimation, and so I thought it importantto give a name to this, and that's what I refer toas globaloney, the difference between the dark blue barsand the light gray bars.Especially because, I suspect, some of you may still bea little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's importantto just spend a little bit of time thinking aboutwhy we might be prone to globaloney.A couple of different reasons come to mind.First of all, there's a real dearth of data in the debate.Let me give you an example. When I first publishedsome of these data a few years agoin a magazine called Foreign Policy,one of the people who wrote in, not entirely in agreement,was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled"Why the World Isn't Flat," that wasn't too surprising. (Laughter)What was very surprising to me was Tom's critique,which was, "Ghemawat's data are narrow."And this caused me to scratch my head, becauseas I went back through his several-hundred-page book,I couldn't find a single figure, chart, table,reference or footnote.So my point is, I haven't presented a lot of data hereto convince you that I'm right, but I would urge youto go away and look for your own datato try and actually assess whether some of thesehand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded withactually are correct.So dearth of data in the debate is one reason.A second reason has to do with peer pressure.I remember, I decided to write my"Why the World Isn't Flat" article, becauseI was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai,and the interviewer's first question to me was,"Professor Ghemawat, why do you still believethat the world is round?" And I started laughing,because I hadn't come across that formulation before. (Laughter)And as I was laughing, I was thinking,I really need a more coherent response, especiallyon national TV. I'd better write something about this. (Laughter)But what I can't quite capture for youwas the pity and disbeliefwith which the interviewer asked her question.The perspective was, here is this poor professor.He's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years.He really has no ideaas to what's actually going on in the world.So try this out with your friends and acquaintances,if you like. You'll find that it's very coolto talk about the world being one, etc.If you raise questions about that formulation,you really are considered a bit of an antique.And then the final reason, which I mention,especially to a TED audience, with some trepidation,has to do with what I call "techno-trances."If you listen to techno music for long periods of time,it does things to your brainwave activity. (Laughter)Something similar seems to happenwith exaggerated conceptions of how technologyis going to overpower in the very immediate runall cultural barriers, all political barriers,all geographic barriers, because at this pointI know you aren't allowed to ask me questions,but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students,hands go up, and people ask me,"Yeah, but what about Facebook?"And I got this question often enough that I thoughtI'd better do some research on Facebook.Because, in some sense, it's the ideal kind of technologyto think about. Theoretically, it makes itas easy to form friendships halfway around the worldas opposed to right next door.What percentage of people's friends on Facebookare actually located in countries other than wherepeople we're analyzing are based?The answer is probably somewhere between10 to 15 percent.Non-negligible, so we don't live in an entirely localor national world, but very, very far from the 95 percent levelthat you would expect, and the reason's very simple.We don't, or I hope we don't, form friendships at randomon Facebook. The technology is overlaidon a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have,and those relationships are what the technologydoesn't quite displace. Those relationships are whywe get far fewer than 95 percent of our friendsbeing located in countries other than where we are.So does all this matter? Or is globaloneyjust a harmless way of getting people to pay more attentionto globalization-related issues?I want to suggest that actually,globaloney can be very harmful to your health.First of all, recognizing that the glassis only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeingthat there might be potential for additional gainsfrom additional integration,whereas if we thought we were already there,there would be no particular point to pushing harder.It's a little bit like, we wouldn't be having a conferenceon radical openness if we already thought we were totally opento all the kinds of influences that are being talked aboutat this conference.So being accurate about how limited globalization levels areis critical to even being able to noticethat there might be room for something more,something that would contribute further to global welfare.Which brings me to my second point.Avoiding overstatement is also very helpfulbecause it reduces and in some cases even reversessome of the fears that people have about globalization.So I actually spend most of my "World 3.0" bookworking through a litany of market failures and fearsthat people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate.I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today,so let me just present to you two headlinesas an illustration of what I have in mind.Think of France and the current debate about immigration.When you ask people in France what percentageof the French population is immigrants,the answer is about 24 percent. That's their guess.Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percentmight help cool some of the superheated rhetoricthat we see around the immigration issue.Or to take an even more striking example,when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relationsdid a survey of Americans, asking them to guesswhat percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid,the guess was 30 percent, which isslightly in excess of the actual level — ("actually about ... 1%") (Laughter) —of U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid.The reassuring thing about this particular survey was,when it was pointed out to people how fartheir estimates were from the actual data,some of them — not all of them — seemed to becomemore willing to consider increases in foreign aid.So foreign aid is actually a great wayof sort of wrapping up here, becauseif you think about it, what I've been talking about todayis this notion -- very uncontroversial amongst economists --that most things are very home-biased."Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people,"is about the most home-biased thing you can find.If you look at the OECD countries and how muchthey spend per domestic poor person,and compare it with how much they spendper poor person in poor countries,the ratio — Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations —turns out to be about 30,000 to one.Now of course, some of us, if we truly are cosmopolitan,would like to see that ratio being brought downto one-is-to-one.I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aimfor that to make substantial progress from where we are.If we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one,we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreedat the Rio Summit 20 years ago that the summitthat ended last week made no further progress on.So in summary, while radical openness is great,given how closed we are,even incremental openness could make thingsdramatically better. Thank you very much. (Applause)(Applause)

Over the past six months, I've spent my timetraveling. I think I've done 60,000 miles,but without leaving my desk.And the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people.I look like one person but I'm two people. I'm Eddie who is here,and at the same time, my alter ego is a big green boxyavatar nicknamed Cyber Frank.So that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start,if it's possible, with a test, because I do business stuff,so it's important that we focus on outcomes.And then I struggled, because I was thinking to myself,"What should I talk? What should I do? It's a TED audience.It's got to be stretching. How am I going to make — ?"So I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right.So let's just walk our way through this.Please could you work this through with me? You can shout out the answer if you like.The question is, which of these horizontal lines is longer?The answer is?Audience: The same.Eddie Obeng: The same.No, they're not the same. (Laughter)They're not the same. The top one is 10 percent longer than the bottom one.So why did you tell me they were the same? Do you remember when we were kids at school,about that big, they played the same trick on us?It was to teach us parallax. Do you remember?And you got, you said, "It's the same!" And you got it wrong.You remember? And you learned the answer, and you've carried this answer in your head for 10, 20, 30, 40 years:The answer is the same. The answer is the same. So when you're asked what the lengths are,you say they're the same, but they're not the same, because I've changed it.And this is what I'm trying to explain has happened to us in the 21st century.Somebody or something has changed the rulesabout how our world works.When I'm joking, I try and explain it happened at midnight,you see, while we were asleep, but it was midnight 15 years ago. Okay?You didn't notice it? But basically, what they do is,they switched all the rules round, so that the way tosuccessfully run a business, an organization, or even a country,has been deleted, flipped, and it's a completely new— you think I'm joking, don't you — there's a completely new set of rules in operation. (Laughter)Did you notice that? I mean, you missed this one.You probably — No, you didn't. Okay. (Laughter)My simple idea is that what's happened is,the real 21st century around us isn't so obvious to us,so instead we spend our time responding rationallyto a world which we understand and recognize,but which no longer exists.You don't believe me, do you? Okay. (Applause)So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand.If you search Amazon for the word "creativity,"you'll discover something like 90,000 books.If you go on Google and you look for "innovation + creativity,"you get 30 million hits. If you add the word "consultants," it doubles to 60 million. (Laughter)Are you with me? And yet, statistically, what you discoveris that about one in 100,000 ideas is found making moneyor delivering benefits two years after its inception.It makes no sense. Companies make their expensive executivesspend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgetswhich are obsolete or need changing before they can be published.How is that possible? If you look at the visions we have,the visions of how we're going to change the world,the key thing is implementation. We have the vision.We've got to make it happen.We've spent decades professionalizing implementation.People are supposed to be good at making stuff happen.However, if I use as an example a family of fivegoing on holiday, if you can imagine this,all the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong,what I want you to think about is their budget is only 3,000 pounds of expenses.What actually happens is, if I compare this to the averagereal project, average real successful project,the family actually end up in Makassar, South Sulawesi,at a cost of 4,000 pounds,whilst leaving two of the children behind. (Laughter)What I'm trying to explain to you is, there are things which don't make sense to us.It gets even worse than that. Let me just walk you through this one.This is a quote, and I'll just pick words out of it.It says -- I'll put on the voice -- "In summary, your Majesty,the failure to foresee the timing, extent and severityof the crisis was due to the lack of creativityand the number of bright minds," or something like that.This was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of Englandwhen she asked the question,"Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming?" (Laughter)I'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood. (Laughter)That's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is,these are eminent economists, some of the smartest peopleon the planet. Do you see the challenge? (Laughter)It's scary. My friend and mentor, Tim Brown of IDEO,he explains that design must get big, and he's right.He wisely explains this to us. He says design thinkingmust tackle big systems for the challenges we have.He's absolutely right.And then I ask myself, "Why was it ever small?"Isn't it weird? You know, if collaboration is so cool,is cross-functional working is so amazing,why did we build these huge hierarchies? What's going on?You see, I think what's happened, perhaps, is thatwe've not noticed that change I described earlier.What we do know is that the world has accelerated.Cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light.Technology accelerates things exponentially.So if this is now, and that's the past,and we start thinking about change, you know,all governments are seeking change, you're here seeking change,everybody's after change, it's really cool. (Laughter)So what happens is, we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change.The speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing.At the same time, as we've done that, we've done something really weird.We've doubled the population in 40 years,put half of them in cities, then connected them all up so they can interact.The density of the interaction of human beings is amazing.There are charts which show all these movements of information. That density of information is amazing.And then we've done a third thing.you know, for those of you who have as an officea little desk underneath the stairs, and you say, well this is my little desk under the stairs,no! You are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you're connected to the Internet.What's happened is, we've changed the scale.Size and scale are no longer the same.And then add to that, every time you tweet,over a third of your followers follow from a countrywhich is not your own.Global is the new scale. We know that.And so people say things like, "The world is now a turbulent place." Have you heard them saying things like that?And they use it as a metaphor. Have you come across this?And they think it's a metaphor, but this is not a metaphor.It's reality. As a young engineering student, I remembergoing to a demonstration where they basically,the demonstrator did something quite intriguing.What he did was, he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before? —he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was,you had a situation where — I'll try and draw the tapand the pipe, actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard.Okay? So I'll write the word "tap." Is that okay? It's a tap. (Laughter)Okay, so he attaches it to a transparent pipe, and he turns the water on.And he says, do you notice anything? And the water is whooshing down this pipe.I mean, this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me?So the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great.And he says, "Anything you notice?" No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe,and he connects this to a container, and he fillsthe container up with green ink. You with me?So guess what happens? A thin green line comes outas it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting.And then he turns the water up a bit, so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes.So he's changing the flow of the water, but it's just a boring green line.He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens.There's this little flicker, and then as he turns it ever so slightly more,the whole of that green line disappears, and insteadthere are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle.They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the inkso that it actually gets diluted out, and the color's gone.What's happened in this world of pipeis somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent.All the rules are gone. In that environment, instantly,all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available,and it's not the same as laminar.And if we didn't have that green ink, you'd never notice.And I think this is our challenge, because somebodyhas actually increased — and it's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff —the speed, the scale and the density of interaction.Now how do we cope and deal with that?Well, we could just call it turbulence, or we could try and learn.Yes, learn, but I know you guys grew up in the days whenthere were actually these things called correct answers,because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle,and you believe it will last forever.So I'll put a little line up here which represents learning,and that's how we used to do it. We could see things,understand them, take the time to put them into practice.Out here is the world. Now, what's happened to our paceof learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you workfor a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to workon stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy,and anyway, you've got to go through your monthly meetings.If you work in an institution, one day you will get them to make that decision.And if you work in a market where people believe in cycles,it's even funnier, because you have to wait all the wayfor the cycle to fail before you go, "There's something wrong." You with me?So it's likely that the line, in terms of learning, is pretty flat.You with me? This point over here, the point at whichthe lines cross over, the pace of changeovertakes the pace of learning,and for me, that is what I was describingwhen I was telling you about midnight.So what does it do to us? Well, it completely transforms what we have to do,many mistakes we make. We solve last year's problemswithout thinking about the future. If you try and think about it,the things you're solving now, what problems are they going to bring in the future?If you haven't understood the world you're living in,it's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you're going to deliver fits.I'll give you an example, a quick one. Creativity and ideas,I mentioned that earlier. All the CEOs around me, my clients, they want innovation,so they seek innovation. They say to people, "Take risks and be creative!"But unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air.Entering their ears, what they hear is, "Do crazy things and then I'll fire you." Why? (Laughter) Because —Why? Because in the old world, okay, in the old world,over here, getting stuff wrong was unacceptable.If you got something wrong, you'd failed. How should you be treated?Well, harshly, because you could have asked somebody who had experience.So we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for 20, 30 years, are you with me?The answer is, don't do things which are different.And then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn't work.You see, in reality, there are two ways you can fail in our new world.One, you're doing something that you should follow a procedure to, and it's a very difficult thing,you're sloppy, you get it wrong. How should you be treated? You should probably be fired.On the other hand, you're doing something new, no one's ever done before,you get it completely wrong. How should you be treated?Well, free pizzas! You should be treated better than the people who succeed.It's called smart failure. Why? Because you can't put it on your C.V.So what I want to leave you, then, is with the explanationof why I actually traveled 60,000 miles from my desk.When I realized the power of this new world,I quit my safe teaching job, and set up a virtual business school,the first in the world, in order to teach people how to make this happen,and I used some of my learnings about some of the rules which I'd learned on myself.If you're interested, worldaftermidnight.com, you'll find out more,but I've applied them to myself for over a decade,and I'm still here, and I still have my house, and the most important thing is,I hope I've done enough to inject a little green ink into your lives,so that when you go away and you're making your nextabsolutely sensible and rational decision, you'll take some time to think,"Hmm, I wonder whether this also makes sensein our new world after midnight." Thank you very much.(Applause)Thank you, thank you. (Applause)



tim_leberecht_3_ways_to_usefully_lose_control_of_your_reputation
904958

Companies are losing control.What happens on Wall Streetno longer stays on Wall Street.What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube. (Laughter)Reputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle.Management teams seem increasinglydisconnected from their staff. (Laughter)A recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believetheir employees are inspired by their firm.However, in the same survey, only four percentof employees agreed.Companies are losing controlof their customers and their employees.But are they really?I'm a marketer, and as a marketer, I knowthat I've never really been in control.Your brand is what other people say about youwhen you're not in the room, the saying goes.Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companiesto be in that room now, 24/7.They can listen and join the conversation.In fact, they have more control over the loss of controlthan ever before.They can design for it. But how?First of all, they can give employees and customers more control.They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas,knowledge, content, designs and product.They can give them more control over pricing,which is what the band Radiohead didwith its pay-as-you-like online release of its album"In Rainbows." Buyers could determine the price,but the offer was exclusive, and only stood for a limited period of time.The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band.The Danish chocolate company Anthon Bergopened a so-called "generous store" in Copenhagen.It asked customers to purchase chocolatewith the promise of good deeds towards loved ones.It turned transactions into interactions,and generosity into a currency.Companies can even give control to hackers.When Microsoft Kinect came out,the motion-controlled add-on to its Xbox gaming console,it immediately drew the attention of hackers.Microsoft first fought off the hacks, but then shifted coursewhen it realized that actively supporting the communitycame with benefits.The sense of co-ownership, the free publicity,the added value, all helped drive sales.The ultimate empowerment of customersis to ask them not to buy.Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyersto check out eBay for its used productsand to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones.In an even more radical stance against consumerism,the company placed a "Don't Buy This Jacket"advertisement during the peak of shopping season.It may have jeopardized short-term sales,but it builds lasting, long-term loyaltybased on shared values.Research has shown that giving employees more controlover their work makes them happier and more productive.The Brazilian company Semco Group famouslylets employees set their own work schedulesand even their salaries.Hulu and Netflix, among other companies,have open vacation policies.Companies can give people more control,but they can also give them less control.Traditional business wisdom holds that trustis earned by predictable behavior,but when everything is consistent and standardized,how do you create meaningful experiences?Giving people less control might be a wonderful wayto counter the abundance of choiceand make them happier.Take the travel service Nextpedition.Nextpedition turns the trip into a game,with surprising twists and turns along the way.It does not tell the traveler where she's goinguntil the very last minute, and information is providedjust in time. Similarly, Dutch airline KLMlaunched a surprise campaign, seemingly randomlyhanding out small gifts to travelersen route to their destination.U.K.-based Interflora monitored Twitterfor users who were having a bad day,and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers.Is there anything companies can do to maketheir employees feel less pressed for time? Yes.Force them to help others.A recent study suggests that having employees completeoccasional altruistic tasks throughout the dayincreases their sense of overall productivity.At Frog, the company I work for, we hold internalspeed meet sessions that connect old and new employees,helping them get to know each other fast.By applying a strict process, we give them less control,less choice, but we enable more and richer social interactions.Companies are the makers of their fortunes,and like all of us, they are utterly exposed to serendipity.That should make them more humble, more vulnerableand more human.At the end of the day, as hyperconnectivityand transparency expose companies' behaviorin broad daylight, staying true to their true selvesis the only sustainable value proposition.Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said,"What's interesting about you is you."For the true selves of companies to come through,openness is paramount,but radical openness is not a solution,because when everything is open, nothing is open."A smile is a door that is half open and half closed,"the author Jennifer Egan wrote.Companies can give their employees and customersmore control or less. They can worry about how muchopenness is good for them, and what needs to stay closed.Or they can simply smile, and remain opento all possibilities.Thank you. (Applause)(Applause)

Right?We are also influenced by our nonverbals,So what nonverbals am I talking about?of power and dominance.Well, this is what they are.So you make yourself big, you stretch out,It's about opening up.It's not just limited to primates.And humans do the same thing. (Laughter)This expression, which is known as pride,Jessica Tracy has studied.when they win at a physical competition.They do this.What do we do when we feel powerless?We do exactly the opposite.We make ourselves small.We do the opposite of them.and what do I notice?They raise their hands like this.I notice a couple of things about this.One, you're not going to be surprised.It seems to be related to gender.so this is not surprising.But the other thing I noticedSo I started to wonder, you know, okay,that makes you seem more powerful?But our question really was,There's some evidence that they do.but also, when we're forced to smileSo it goes both ways.So when you feel powerful,you're more likely to do this,what am I talking about?So I'm talking about thoughts and feelingsand cortisol, which is the stress hormone.have high testosterone and low cortisol,and powerful and effective leadersbecause that was about dominance.Probably not, right?So we know that in primate hierarchies,if an alpha needs to take over,the mind, at least at the facial level,So this is what we did.and these people adopted, for two minutes,although they took on only two.So here's one.A couple more.Here are a couple more.And here are the low-power poses.This one is very low-power.So this is what happens.They come in, they spit into a vial,They don't look at pictures of the poses.We want them to be feeling power.So two minutes they do this.and then we take another saliva sample.That's it. That's the whole experiment.So this is what we find.Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,86 percent of you will gamble.Here's what we find on testosterone.From their baseline when they come in,Here's what you get on cortisol.that configure your brainAnd we've all had the feeling, right?Also, our bodies change our minds.But the next question, of course,is, can power posing for a few minutesWhere can you actually apply this?Which we cared about, of course.like social threat situations.or doing a job interview.So we published these findings,and the media are all over it,and they say, Okay, so this is what you do(Laughter)For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.It's you talking to yourself.You're looking at your notes,you're hunching up, making yourself small,So that's what we want to test. Okay?So we bring people into a lab,They're being judged also,so they look like this.People hate this.So this really spikes your cortisol.all the high-power posers."We don't want to hire these people.But what's driving it?It's not about the content of the speech.These kinds of things.They're bringing themselves.They bring their ideas, but as themselves,with no, you know, residue over them.So when I tell people about this,"It feels fake." Right?So I said, fake it till you make it.It's not me.I don't want to feel like an impostor.And that really resonated with me,I was thrown from the car.And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,and I had been withdrawn from college,which was very traumatic.and I had been called gifted as a child.but that's not going to work out for you."and for me it was being smart,having that taken from you,So I felt entirely powerless.I worked and worked, and I got lucky,and worked, and got lucky, and worked.Eventually I graduated from college.I am an impostor.And the night before my first-year talk,That's it.She was like, "You are not quitting,You are going to fake it.and having an out-of-body experience,So that's what I did.Five years in grad school,I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,"Not supposed to be here."So at the end of my first year at Harvard,"I'm not supposed to be here."And that was the moment for me.Because two things happened.One was that I realized,Like, she can fake it, she can become it.And tomorrow you're going to fake it,(Applause)and people turned around and were like,She comes back to me months later,So she had changed.Fake it till you become it.Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.So, this is two minutes.Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.That's what you want to do.Leave that situation feeling like,Give it away. Share it with people,because the people who can use it the mostand no status and no power.Thank you.(Applause)

or underemployed,to the labor force.And as I look at the conversation,The topic that it's focused on,people's ability to earn a living,or, to say it a little bit different way,are the droids taking our jobs?And there's some evidence that they are.its kind of slow, steady march upward,Corporate profits are quite high;in fact, if you include bank profits,they're higher than they've ever been.What they're not really doing is hiring.So this red lineis the employment-to-population ratio,who have work.than at the beginning.This is not what you want to see.versus the number of jobs in the country,I did some quick calculations.I took the last 20 years of GDP growthto keep growing,and this is the line that I came up with.Is that good or bad?This is the government's projectionbecause when I did it,with labor productivity growth,and that's actually not what I believe.Because when I look around,I think that we ain't seen nothing yetdo for a living.Let me give you a couple examples.Throughout all of history,you had to involve a human being.Now we have multi-language, instantaneous,And if any of us have used these,Not anymore.about Apple's earnings.It was written by an algorithm.And it's not decent -- it's perfect.A lot of people look at this and they say,and that's very, very hard to automate."is a guy named Ken Jennings.Took home three million dollars.about this idea of a generalist,and repeat speech back to us.but we should also keep in mindwhich they will,which is as cool as it sounds.(Laughter)very smoothly.in the United States;They can't do very much.But they're getting better quite quicklyis trying to accelerate their trajectory.by encouraging entrepreneurshipand by investing in infrastructure,But in the not-too-long-term,that our society faces.Voltaire summarized why; he said,But despite this challenge --and I am supremely confidentnot a dystopian future.And to explain why,I want to ask:in response to this question.because some people are going to bring upAnd then other people will say,And then some other folk will say,"Actually, what changes civilizations,so the great developments in human historyare stories of conquest and of war.""Hey, don't forget about plagues!"(Laughter)and the opening up of the world.of the arts and sciences.So this debate will go on and on.It's an endless debateBut if you're a geek like me,you say, "Well, what do the data say?"And you start to do thingsor some measure of social developmentor the state of advancement of a society.You conclude, actually,(Laughter)and it is a technology story.of the Industrial Revolutionovercoming the limitations of our muscles.Now, what we're in the middle of nowHow can this not be as big a dealThe best days are really ahead.Let me give you a couple examples.Economies don't run on energy.Economies run on ideas.in an economy.(Laughter)We'd take them out of elite institutions,and we'd wait for the innovation.Now --(Laughter)I've got no problem with this.(Laughter)But some other people do,and they've kind of crashed the party(Laughter)and I assure you that nobody caresor what they look like.in the technology-facilitated world.and what's not happening,of people at the bottom of the pyramid."where he watched, in great detail,But when I read his paper,and say, "Look, this was a big deal.in these villages measurably improved."where technology made things better.to an environment and a community:So as I look around at all the evidenceI become a huge digital optimistis actually not hyperbole.Our technologies are great gifts,all around the world.So, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs,what we're going to do is reduce povertyand drudgery and misery around the world.with our new digital toolsI'm going to leave the last wordour old friend Ken Jennings.I'm with him; I'm going to echo his words:(Laughter)Thanks very much.(Applause)

So if someone asked youfor the three words that would sum upyour reputation, what would you say?How would people describe your judgment,your knowledge, your behaviors, in different situations?Today I'd like to explore with youwhy the answer to this questionwill become profoundly importantin an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.I'd like to start by introducing you to someonewhose life has been changed by a marketplacefueled by reputation.Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast hoston Airbnb since 2008.I caught up with him recently, where, over the courseof several cups of tea, he told me howhosting guests from all over the worldhas enriched his life.More than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-centurywatchhouse he lives in with his cat, Squeak.Now, I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guesthappened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen,and she promised that she would refrain from leavinga bad review on one condition: he got a cat.And so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation.Now, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peermarketplace that matches people who have space to rentwith people who are looking for a place to stayin over 192 countries.The places being rented out are things that you mightexpect, like spare rooms and holiday homes,but part of the magic is the unique placesthat you can now access: treehouses, teepees,airplane hangars, igloos.If you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the roadthat you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.It's a fantastic example of how technologyis creating a marketfor things that never had a marketplace before.Now let me show you these heat maps of Paristo see how insanely fast it's growing.This image here is from 2008.The pink dots represent host properties.Even four years ago, letting strangers stay in your homeseemed like a crazy idea.Now the same view in 2010.And now, 2012.There is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris.Now, what's happening here is people are realizingthe power of technology to unlock the idling capacityand value of all kinds of assets,from skills to spaces to material possessions,in ways and on a scale never possible before.It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption,and, through it, people like Sebastianare becoming micro-entrepreneurs.They're empowered to make money and save moneyfrom their existing assets.But the real magic and the secret source behindcollaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnbisn't the inventory or the money.It's using the power of technology to build trustbetween strangers.This side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summerduring the London riots.He woke up around 9, and he checked his emailand he saw a bunch of messages all asking himif he was okay.Former guests from around the world had seen thatthe riots were happening just down the street, and wantedto check if he needed anything.Sebastian actually said to me, he said, "Thirteen former guestscontacted me before my own mother rang." (Laughter)Now, this little anecdote gets to the heart of whyI'm really passionate about collaborative consumption,and why, after I finished my book, I decidedI'm going to try and spread this into a global movement.Because at its core, it's about empowerment.It's about empowering people to make meaningful connections,connections that are enabling us to rediscovera humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way,by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter,like Etsy, that are built on personal relationshipsversus empty transactions.Now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us backto old market principles and collaborative behaviorsthat are hard-wired in all of us.They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevantfor the Facebook age.We're literally beginning to realize that we have wiredour world to share, swap, rent, barter or tradejust about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar,our bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes,our gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowingmoney from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club.We are trading lessons on everything from sushi-makingto coding on Skillshare,and we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay.Now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumptionthat's enabling us to match wants with havesin more democratic ways.Now, collaborative consumption is creating the startof a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand,but it's also a part of a massive value shift underway,where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses,people are consuming to get to know the Joneses.But the key reason why it's taking off now so fastis because every new advancement of technologyincreases the efficiency and the social glue of trustto make sharing easier and easier.Now, I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces,and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients.Let me give you an example.Meet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet,the best job title here of SuperRabbit.Now, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately,as an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people,he struggled to find a new one during the recession.And then he happened to stumble across a post aboutTaskRabbit.Now, the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so manygreat stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe.Now what happened was, in February 2008,Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take themout for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to themand he was salivating with saliva.They realized they'd run out of dog food.Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.Now, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeksstarting talking about how cool it would be if some kind ofeBay for errands existed.Six months later, Leah quit her job,and TaskRabbit was born.At the time, she didn't realize that she was actually hittingon a bigger idea she later called service networking.It's essentially about how we use our online relationshipsto get things done in the real world.Now the way TaskRabbit works is, people outsourcethe tasks that they want doing, name the pricethey're willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbitsbid to run the errand.Yes, there's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview processthat's designed to find the people that would makegreat personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.Now, there's over 4,000 Rabbits across the United Statesand 5,000 more on the waiting list.Now the tasks being posted are things that you mightexpect, like help with household choresor doing some supermarket runs.I actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousandloads of laundry have been cleaned and foldedthrough TaskRabbit.But I love that the number one task posted,over a hundred times a day, is something that many of ushave felt the pain of doing:yes, assembling Ikea furniture. (Laughter) (Applause)It's brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris hereis actually making up to 5,000 dollars a monthrunning errands around his life.And 70 percent of this new labor forcewere previously unemployed or underemployed.I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumptionare like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant.Now, when you think about it, it's amazing, right,that over the past 20 years, we've evolvedfrom trusting people online to share informationto trusting to handing over our credit card information,and now we're entering the third trust wave:connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kindsof people-powered marketplaces.I actually came across this fascinating studyby the Pew Center this week that revealedthat an active Facebook user is three times as likelyas a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy.Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one anotherface to face.Now, with all of my optimism, and I am an optimist,comes a healthy dose of caution, or rather, an urgent needto address some pressing, complex questions.How to ensure our digital identities reflect ourreal world identities? Do we want them to be the same?How do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online?How do we stop people who've behaved badlyin one community doing so under a different guise?In a similar way that companies often use some kind ofcredit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan,or the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that dependon transactions between relative strangersneed some kind of device to let you know that Sebastianand Chris are good eggs,and that device is reputation.Reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you.Let's just take a look at Chris.You can see that over 200 people have given himan average rating over 4.99 out of 5.There are over 20 pages of reviews of his workdescribing him as super-friendly and fast,and he's reached level 25, the highest level,making him a SuperRabbit.Now — (Laughter) -- I love that word, SuperRabbit.And interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputationhas gone up, so has his chances of winning a bidand how much he can charge.In other words, for SuperRabbits, reputationhas a real world value.Now, I know what you might be thinking.Well, this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellerson eBay or star ratings on Amazon.The difference today is that, with every trade we make,comment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn,we leave a reputation trailof how well we can and can't be trusted.And it's not just the breadth but the volumeof reputation data out there that is staggering.Just consider this: Five million nights have been bookedon Airbnb in the past six months alone.30 million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com.This year, two billion dollars worth of loanswill go through peer-to-peer lending platforms.This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation dataon how well we behave or misbehave.Now, capturing and correlating the trails of informationthat we leave in different places is a massive challenge,but one we're being asked to figure out.What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully askis, shouldn't they own their reputation data?Shouldn't the reputation that he's personally investedon building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with himfrom one community to another?What I mean by this is, say he started selling second-handbooks on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch?It's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney.It was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone planbecause my credit history didn't travel with me.I was essentially a ghost in the system.Now I'm not suggesting that the next stageof the reputation economy is aboutadding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score.People's lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?I also want to be clear that this isn't about adding uptweets and likes and friends in a clout-like fashion.Those guys are measuring influence, not behaviorsthat indicate our trustworthiness.But the most important thing that we have to keep in mindis that reputation is largely contextual.Just because Sebastian is a wonderful hostdoes not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture.The big challenge is figuring out what datamakes sense to pull, because the future'sgoing to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation,not a single algorithm.It's only a matter of time before we'll be able to performa Facebook- or Google-like searchand see a complete picture of someone's behaviorsin different contexts over time.I envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you,when, where and why, your reliability on TaskRabbit,your cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb,the knowledge that you display on Quora or [unclear],they'll all live together in one place,and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboardthat will paint a picture of your reputation capital.Now this is a concept that I'm currently researchingand writing my next book on, and currently defineas the worth of your reputation, your intentions,capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.This isn't some far-off frontier.There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Meand Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out howyou can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.Now, I realize that this concept may sound a littleBig Brother to some of you, and yes, there are someenormous transparency and privacy issues to solve,but ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation,we can actually control it more, and extractthe immense value that will flow from it.Also, more so than our credit history,we can actually shape our reputation.Just think of Sebastianand how he bought the cat to influence his.Now privacy issues aside, the other really interesting issueI'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts,people [who] for whatever reason, are not active online,but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world?How do we take their contributions to their jobs,their communities and their families,and convert that value into reputation capital?Ultimately, when we get it right, reputation capitalcould create a massive positive disruptionin who has power, trust and influence.A three-digit score, your traditional credit history,that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is,will no longer be the determining factorin how much things cost, what we can access,and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will becomemore powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.Reputation will be the currency that saysthat you can trust me.Now the interesting thing is, reputationis the socioeconomic lubricantthat makes collaborative consumption work and scale,but the sources it will be generated from,and its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting,where reputation data will make the résumé seemlike an archaic relic of the past.Four years ago, tech bloggers and entrepreneursJoel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, decided to start somethingcalled Stack Overflow.Now, Stack Overflow is basically a platform whereexperienced programmers can askother good programmers highly detailed technical questionson things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions.This site receives five and a half thousand questions a day,and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers.Now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways,but it's basically by convincing their peersthey know what they're talking about.Now a few months after this site launched, the foundersheard about something interesting,and it actually didn't surprise them.What they heard was that users were puttingtheir reputation scores on the top of their résumés,and that recruiters were searching the platformto find people with unique talents.Now thousands of programmers today are findingbetter jobs this way, because Stack Overflowand the reputation dashboards provide a priceless windowinto how someone really behaves,and what their peers think of them.But the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow,I think, is incredibly exciting.People are starting to realize that the reputationthey generate in one place has valuebeyond the environments from which it was built.You know, it's very interesting.When you talk to super-users, whether that's SuperRabbitsor super-people on Stack Overflow, or Uberhosts,they all talk about how having a high reputationunlocks a sense of their own power.On Stack Overflow, it creates a level playing field,enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top.On Airbnb, the people often become more importantthan the spaces. On TaskRabbit,it gives people control of their economic activity.Now at the end of my tea with Sebastian, he told me how,on a bad, rainy day, when he hasn't had a customerin his bookstore, he thinks of all the people aroundthe world who've said something wonderful about him,and what that says about him as a person.He's turning 50 this year, and he's convincedthat the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnbwill lead him to doing something interestingwith the rest of his life.You know, there are only a few windows in historywhere the opportunity exists to reinventpart of how our socioeconomic system works.We're living through one of those moments.I believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolutionthat will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.In the 20th century, the invention of traditional credittransformed our consumer system, and in many wayscontrolled who had access to what.In the 21st century, new trust networks,and the reputation capital they generate, will reinventthe way we think about wealth, markets, powerand personal identity, in ways we can't yet even imagine.Thank you very much.

I've always written primarily about architecture,about buildings, and writing about architectureis based on certain assumptions.An architect designs a building, and it becomes a place,or many architects design many buildings, and it becomesa city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forcesof politics and culture and economics that shapesthese places, at the end of the day, you can goand you can visit them. You can walk around them.You can smell them. You can get a feel for them.You can experience their sense of place.But what was striking to me over the last several yearswas that less and less was I going out into the world,and more and more, I was sitting in front of my computer screen.And especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone,I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day,but I was also getting up at the end of the dayand looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.And what was surprising to me was how quicklymy relationship to the physical world had changed.In this very short period of time, you know, whether youcall it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last,you know, four or five years of being online all the time,our relationship to our surroundings had changed in thatour attention is constantly divided. You know,we're both looking inside the screens and we're lookingout in the world around us.And what was even more striking to me, and what I reallygot hung up on, was that the world inside the screenseemed to have no physical reality of its own.If you went and looked for images of the Internet,this was all that you found, this famous image by Opteof the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expansewhere we don't seem to be anywhere on it.We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth,the blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest,I think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse.So if there was this world and this screen, and if there wasthe physical world around me, I couldn't ever get themtogether in the same place.And then this happened.My Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does,and the cable guy came to fix it, and he started withthe dusty clump of cables behind the couch,and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard,and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire,and he said, "There's your problem.A squirrel is chewing on your Internet." (Laughter)And this seemed astounding. The Internet isa transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changedeverything from shopping to dating to revolutions.It was unequivocally not somethinga squirrel could chew on. (Laughter)But that in fact seemed to be the case.A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet. (Laughter)And then I got this image in my head of what would happenif you yanked the wire from the wall and if you startedto follow it. Where would it go?Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit?Could I go there? Who would I meet?You know, was there something actually out there?And the answer, by all accounts, was no.This was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it,as represented in the sitcom "The IT Crowd."Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben,because that's where you get the best reception,but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow itfor the afternoon to use in an office presentation.The elders of the Internet were willing to part with itfor a short while, and she looks at it and she says,"This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"They say, "Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything."And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thingthat only fools seem to look for.The Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a sillyblack box with a blinking red light on it.It wasn't a real world out there.But, in fact, it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there,and that's what I spent about two years visiting,these places of the Internet. I was in large data centersthat use as much power as the cities in which they sit,and I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York,which is one of the buildings in the world,one of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings,where more networks of the Internet connect to each otherthan anywhere else.And that connection is an unequivocally physical process.It's about the router of one network, a Facebook ora Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is,connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up intothe ceiling and down into the router of another network,and that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate.A building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others,has 10 times more networks connecting within itthan the next tier of buildings.There's a very short list of these places.And 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it's hometo about a half a dozen very important networks,which are the networks which serve the undersea cablesthat travel underneath the oceanthat connect Europe and America and connect all of us.And it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on.If the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we livein a global village, it's because there are cables underneaththe ocean, cables like this.And in this dimension, they are incredibly small.You can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose.But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive,as expansive as you can imagine.They stretch across the ocean. They're three or fiveor eight thousand miles in length, andif the material science and the computational technologyis incredibly complicated, the basic physical processis shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the oceanand comes out on the other, and it usually comesfrom a building called a landing station that's oftentucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood,and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floorthat look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 milesthey amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmissionis incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-secondwavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your ownconnection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams,but not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of lightthrough one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of lightthrough a single fiber, and then you'll have maybeeight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction.And they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair.And then they connect to the continent somewhere.They connect in a manhole like this. Literally,this is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.And the landscape is changing. Three years ago,when I started thinking about this, there was one cabledown the Western coast of Africa, representedin this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.Now there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable,they realize that it's not enough. If they're going to buildan industry around it, they need to know that their connectionisn't tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks,you have to send a ship out into the water, throwa grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end,and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.It's an intensely, intensely physical process.So this is my friend Simon Cooper, who until very recentlyworked for Tata Communications, the communications wingof Tata, the big Indian industrial conglomerate.And I've never met him. We've only communicatedvia this telepresence system, which always makes methink of him as the man inside the Internet. (Laughter)And he is English. The undersea cable industryis dominated by Englishmen, and they all seem to be 42.(Laughter) Because they all started at the same timewith the boom about 20 years ago.And Tata had gotten its start as a communications businesswhen they bought two cables, one across the Atlanticand one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add piecesonto them, until they had built a belt around the world,which means they will send your bits to the East or the West.They have -- this is literally a beam of light around the world,and if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it'll send it aroundthe other direction. And then having done that,they started to look for places to wire next.They looked for the unwired places, and that's meantNorth and South, primarily these cables to Africa.But what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination.He thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness.And I was particularly interested because I wanted to seeone of these cables being built. See, you know, all the timeonline we experience these fleeting moments of connection,these sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook postor an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that.It seemed like there was a moment when the continentwas being plugged in, and I wanted to see that.And Simon was working on a new cable,WACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretchedfrom Lisbon down the west coast of Africa,to Cote d'Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.And he said there was coming soon, dependingon the weather, but he'd let me know when,and so with about four days notice, he said to goto this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9,this guy will walk out of the water. (Laughter)And he'll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line,called a messenger line, and that was the first linkbetween sea and land, this link that would then beleveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from thisspecialized cable landing ship, and it was floatedon these buoys until it was in the right place.Then you can see the English engineers looking on.And then, once it was in the right place, he got backin the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off,and the buoy popped up into the air, and the cabledropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way outto the ship, and when he got there,they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie,and then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore,and then he lit a cigarette. (Laughter)And then once that cable was on shore,they began to prepare to connect it to the other side,for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.And first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they startsort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a --sort of working like chefs, and then finally they're workinglike jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line upwith the cable that had come down,and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw,you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.And what surprised me as well was that as much as thisis based on the most sophisticated technology, as muchas this is an incredibly new thing, the physical processitself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same.You see the local laborers. You see the English engineergiving directions in the background. And more importantly,the places are the same. These cables still connectthese classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa,Mumbai, Singapore, New York.And then the process on shore takes around three or four days,and then, when it's done, they put the manhole coverback on top, and they push the sand over that,and we all forget about it.And it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud,but every time we put something on the cloud,we give up some responsibility for it.We are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it.And that doesn't seem right.There's a great Neal Stephenson line where he saysthat wired people should know something about wires.And we should know, I think, we should knowwhere our Internet comes from, and we should knowwhat it is that physically, physically connects us all.Thank you. (Applause)(Applause)Thanks. (Applause)



jonathan_trent_energy_from_floating_algae_pods

Some years ago, I set out to try to understandif there was a possibility to develop biofuelson a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuelsbut not compete with agriculture for water,fertilizer or land.So here's what I came up with.Imagine that we build an enclosure where we put itjust underwater, and we fill it with wastewaterand some form of microalgae that produces oil,and we make it out of some kind of flexible materialthat moves with waves underwater,and the system that we're going to build, of course,will use solar energy to grow the algae,and they use CO2, which is good,and they produce oxygen as they grow.The algae that grow are in a container thatdistributes the heat to the surrounding water,and you can harvest them and make biofuelsand cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed,and of course you'd have to make a large area of this,so you'd have to worry about other stakeholderslike fishermen and ships and such things, but hey,we're talking about biofuels,and we know the importance of potentially gettingan alternative liquid fuel.Why are we talking about microalgae?Here you see a graph showing you the different typesof crops that are being considered for making biofuels,so you can see some things like soybean,which makes 50 gallons per acre per year,or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm, and thattall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute.That is to say, microalgae contributes between 2,000and 5,000 gallons per acre per year,compared to the 50 gallons per acre per year from soy.So what are microalgae? Microalgae are micro --that is, they're extremely small, as you can see herea picture of those single-celled organismscompared to a human hair.Those small organisms have been aroundfor millions of years and there's thousandsof different species of microalgae in the world,some of which are the fastest-growing plants on the planet,and produce, as I just showed you, lots and lots of oil.Now, why do we want to do this offshore?Well, the reason we're doing this offshore is becauseif you look at our coastal cities, there isn't a choice,because we're going to use waste water, as I suggested,and if you look at where most of the waste watertreatment plants are, they're embedded in the cities.This is the city of San Francisco, which has 900 milesof sewer pipes under the city already,and it releases its waste water offshore.So different cities around the world treat their waste waterdifferently. Some cities process it.Some cities just release the water.But in all cases, the water that's released isperfectly adequate for growing microalgae.So let's envision what the system might look like.We call it OMEGA, which is an acronym forOffshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae.At NASA, you have to have good acronyms.So how does it work? I sort of showed you how it works already.We put waste water and some source of CO2into our floating structure,and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow,and they sequester CO2 that would otherwise go offinto the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.They of course use solar energy to grow,and the wave energy on the surface provides energyfor mixing the algae, and the temperatureis controlled by the surrounding water temperature.The algae that grow produce oxygen, as I've mentioned,and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food andother bi-algal products of interest.And the system is contained. What do I mean by that?It's modular. Let's say something happens that'stotally unexpected to one of the modules.It leaks. It's struck by lightning.The waste water that leaks out is water that already nowgoes into that coastal environment, andthe algae that leak out are biodegradable,and because they're living in waste water,they're fresh water algae, which means they can'tlive in salt water, so they die.The plastic we'll build it out of is some kind ofwell-known plastic that we have good experience with, andwe'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again.So we may be able to go beyond that when thinking aboutthis system that I'm showing you, and that is to saywe need to think in terms of the water, the fresh water,which is also going to be an issue in the future,and we're working on methods nowfor recovering the waste water.The other thing to consider is the structure itself.It provides a surface for things in the ocean,and this surface, which is covered by seaweedsand other organisms in the ocean,will become enhanced marine habitatso it increases biodiversity.And finally, because it's an offshore structure,we can think in terms of how it might contributeto an aquaculture activity offshore.So you're probably thinking, "Gee, this soundslike a good idea. What can we do to try to see if it's real?"Well, I set up laboratories in Santa Cruzat the California Fish and Game facility,and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanksto test some of these ideas.We also set up experiments in San Franciscoat one of the three waste water treatment plants,again a facility to test ideas.And finally, we wanted to see where we could look atwhat the impact of this structure would bein the marine environment, and we set up a field siteat a place called Moss Landing Marine Labin Monterey Bay, where we worked in a harborto see what impact this would have on marine organisms.The laboratory that we set up in Santa Cruz was our skunkworks.It was a place where we were growing algaeand welding plastic and building toolsand making a lot of mistakes,or, as Edison said, we werefinding the 10,000 ways that the system wouldn't work.Now, we grew algae in waste water, and we built toolsthat allowed us to get into the lives of algaeso that we could monitor the way they grow,what makes them happy, how do we make sure thatwe're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive.So the most important feature that we needed to develop were theseso-called photobioreactors, or PBRs.These were the structures that would be floating at thesurface made out of some inexpensive plastic materialthat'll allow the algae to grow, and we had built lots and lotsof designs, most of which were horrible failures,and when we finally got to a design that worked,at about 30 gallons, we scaled it upto 450 gallons in San Francisco.So let me show you how the system works.We basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it,and we circulate it through this floating structure,this tubular, flexible plastic structure,and it circulates through this thing,and there's sunlight of course, it's at the surface,and the algae grow on the nutrients.But this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag.The algae are not going to suffocate because of CO2,as we would.They suffocate because they produce oxygen, and theydon't really suffocate, but the oxygen that they produceis problematic, and they use up all the CO2.So the next thing we had to figure out was how we couldremove the oxygen, which we did by building this columnwhich circulated some of the water,and put back CO2, which we did by bubbling the systembefore we recirculated the water.And what you see here is the prototype,which was the first attempt at building this type of column.The larger column that we then installed in San Franciscoin the installed system.So the column actually had another very nice feature,and that is the algae settle in the column,and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomassin a context where we could easily harvest it.So we would remove the algaes that concentratedin the bottom of this column, and then we couldharvest that by a procedure where you float the algaeto the surface and can skim it off with a net.So we wanted to also investigate what would be the impactof this system in the marine environment,and I mentioned we set up this experiment at a field sitein Moss Landing Marine Lab.Well, we found of course that this material becameovergrown with algae, and we needed then to developa cleaning procedure, and we also looked at howseabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact yousee here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting,and would periodically work its way across this littlefloating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guyor train him to be able to clean the surfaceof these things, but that's for the future.Now really what we were doing,we were working in four areas.Our research covered the biology of the system,which included studying the way algae grew,but also what eats the algae, and what kills the algae.We did engineering to understand what we would needto be able to do to build this structure,not only on the small scale, but how we would build iton this enormous scale that will ultimately be required.I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammalsand looked at basically the environmental impactof the system, and finally we looked at the economics,and what I mean by economics is,what is the energy required to run the system?Do you get more energy out of the systemthan you have to put into the systemto be able to make the system run?And what about operating costs?And what about capital costs?And what about, just, the whole economic structure?So let me tell you that it's not going to be easy,and there's lots more work to do in all fourof those areas to be able to really make the system work.But we don't have a lot of time, and I'd like to show youthe artist's conception of how this system might lookif we find ourselves in a protected baysomewhere in the world, and we have in the backgroundin this image, the waste water treatment plantand a source of flue gas for the CO2,but when you do the economics of this system,you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work.Unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water,sequester carbon, and potentially for photovoltaic panelsor wave energy or even wind energy,and if you start thinking in terms ofintegrating all of these different activities,you could also include in such a facility aquaculture.So we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculturewhere we're growing mussels or scallops.We'd be growing oysters and thingsthat would be producing high value products and food,and this would be a market driver as we build the systemto larger and larger scales so that it becomes, ultimately,competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels.So there's always a big question that comes up,because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputationright now, and so we've been thinking cradle to cradle.What are we going to do with all this plastic that we'regoing to need to use in our marine environment?Well, I don't know if you know about this,but in California, there's a huge amount of plasticthat's used in fields right now as plastic mulch,and this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhousesright along the surface of the soil, and this provideswarming the soil to increase the growing season,it allows us to control weeds,and, of course, it makes the watering much more efficient.So the OMEGA system will be partof this type of an outcome, and that when we're finishedusing it in the marine environment, we'll be using it,hopefully, on fields.Where are we going to put this,and what will it look like offshore?Here's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay.San Francisco produces 65 million gallons a dayof waste water. If we imagine a five-day retention timefor this system, we'd need 325 million gallonsto accomodate, and that would be about 1,280 acresof these OMEGA modules floating in San Francisco Bay.Well, that's less than one percentof the surface area of the bay.It would produce, at 2,000 gallons per acre per year,it would produce over 2 million gallons of fuel,which is about 20 percent of the biodiesel,or of the diesel that would be required in San Francisco,and that's without doing anything about efficiency.Where else could we potentially put this system?There's lots of possibilities.There's, of course, San Francisco Bay, as I mentioned.San Diego Bay is another example,Mobile Bay or Chesapeake Bay, but the reality is,as sea level rises, there's going to be lots and lotsof new opportunities to consider. (Laughter)So what I'm telling you about is a systemof integrated activities.Biofuels production is integrated with alternative energyis integrated with aquaculture.I set out to find a pathwayto innovative production of sustainable biofuels,and en route I discovered that what's really requiredfor sustainability is integration more than innovation.Long term, I have great faithin our collective and connected ingenuity.I think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplishif we are radically openand we don't care who gets the credit.Sustainable solutions for our future problemsare going to be diverseand are going to be many.I think we need to consider everything,everything from alpha to OMEGA.Thank you. (Applause)(Applause)Chris Anderson: Just a quick question for you, Jonathan.Can this project continue to move forward withinNASA or do you need some very ambitiousgreen energy fund to come and take it by the throat?Jonathan Trent: So it's really gotten to a stage nowin NASA where they would like to spin it out into somethingwhich would go offshore, and there are a lot of issueswith doing it in the United States because of limitedpermitting issues and the time required to get permitsto do things offshore.It really requires, at this point, people on the outside,and we're being radically open with this technologyin which we're going to launch it out therefor anybody and everybody who's interestedto take it on and try to make it real.CA: So that's interesting. You're not patenting it.You're publishing it.JT: Absolutely.CA: All right. Thank you so much.JT: Thank you. (Applause)

In System D, thisis a store,and what I mean by that is that this is a photographI took in Makoko, shantytown in Lagos, Nigeria.It's built over the lagoon, and there are no streetswhere there can be stores to shop,and so the store comes to you.And in the same community,this is business synergy.This is the boat that that lady was paddling around in,and this artisan makes the boat and the paddlesand sells directlyto the people who need the boat and the paddles.And this is a global business.Ogandiro smokes fish in Makoko in Lagos,and I asked her, "Where does the fish come from?"And I thought she'd say, "Oh, you know,up the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa,"but you'll be happy to know she saidit came from here, it comes from the North Sea.It's caught here, frozen, shipped down to Lagos,smoked, and sold for a tiny increment of profiton the streets of Lagos.And this is a business incubator.This is Olusosun dump, the largest garbage dump in Lagos,and 2,000 people work here, and I found this outfrom this fellow, Andrew Saboru.Andrew spent 16 years scavenging materials on the dump,earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler,which meant he carried a scale and went around andweighed all the materials that people had scavengedfrom the dump. Now he's a scrap dealer.That's his little depot behind him,and he earns twice the Nigerian minimum wage.This is a shopping mall.This is Oshodi Market in Lagos.Jorge Luis Borges had a story called "The Aleph,"and the Aleph is a point in the worldwhere absolutely everything exists,and for me, this image is a point in the worldwhere absolutely everything exists.So, what am I talking about when I talk about System D?It's traditionally called the informal economy,the underground economy, the black market.I don't conceive of it that way.I think it's really important to understand that something likethis is totally open. It's right there for you to find.All of this is happening openly, and aboveboard.There's nothing underground about it.It's our prejudgment that it's underground.I've pirated the term System D from the former French colonies.There's a word in French that is débrouillardise,that means to be self-reliant,and the former French colonies have turned that intoSystem D for the economy of self-reliance,or the DIY economy.But governments hate the DIY economy,and that's why -- I took this picture in 2007,and this is the same market in 2009 --and I think, when the organizers of this conferencewere talking about radical openness,they didn't mean that the streets should be openand the people should be gone.I think what we have is a pickle problem.I had a friend who worked at a pickle factory,and the cucumbers would come flying downthis conveyer belt, and his job was to pick off the onesthat didn't look so good and throw them in the binlabeled "relish" where they'd be crushed and mixedwith vinegar and used for other kinds of profit.This is the pickle economy.We're all focusing on — this is a statistic fromearlier this month in the Financial Times —we're all focusing on the luxury economy.It's worth 1.5 trillion dollars every year, and that'sa vast amount of money, right?That's three times the Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland.So it's vast. But it should come with an asterisk,and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workersof the world.1.8 billion people around the world workin the economy that is unregulated and informal.That's a huge number, and what does that mean?Well, it means if it were united in a single political system,one country, call it"The United Street Sellers Republic," the U.S.S.R.,or "Bazaaristan,"it would be worth 10 trillion dollars every year,and that would make it the second largest economyin the world, after the United States.And given that projections are that the bulkof economic growth over the next 15 years will comefrom emerging economies in the developing world,it could easily overtake the United Statesand become the largest economy in the world.So the implications of that are vast, because it meansthat this is where employment is — 1.8 billion people —and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world,because people are actually able to earn money and liveand thrive, as Andrew Saboru did.Big businesses have recognized this,and what's fascinating about this slide,it's not that the guys can carry boxes on their headsand run around without dropping them off.it's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that's madeby a global company called UAC foodsthat's active throughout Africa and the Middle East,but the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores.UAC foods has recognized that it won't sell if it's in stores.It's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkerswho run around the streets of Lagos at bus stationsand in traffic jams and sell it as a snack,and it's been sold that way for 40 years.It's a business plan for a corporation.And it's not just in Africa.Here's Mr. Clean looking amorously at all the otherProcter &amp; Gamble products,and Procter &amp; Gamble, you know,the statistic always cited is that Wal-Martis their largest customer, and it's true, as one store,Wal-Mart buys 15 percent, thus 15 percentof Procter &amp; Gamble's business is with Wal-Mart,but their largest market segment is something that they call"high frequency stores," which is all these tiny kiosksand the lady in the canoe and all these other businessesthat exist in System D, the informal economy,and Procter &amp; Gamble makes 20 percent of its moneyfrom that market segment,and it's the only market segment that's growing.So Procter &amp; Gamble says, "We don't care whether a storeis incorporated or registered or anything like that.We want our products in that store."And then there's mobile phones.This is an ad for MTN,which is a South African multinationalactive in about 25 countries,and when they came into Nigeria —Nigeria is the big dog in Africa.One in seven Africans is a Nigerian,and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone marketin Nigeria. And when MTN came in, they wantedto sell the mobile service like I get in the United Statesor like people get here in the U.K. or in Europe --expensive monthly plans, you get a phone,you pay overages,you're killed with fees --and their plan crashed and burned.And they went back to the drawing board, and they retooled,and they came up with another plan:We don't sell you the phone,we don't sell you the monthly plan.We only sell you airtime.And where's the airtime sold?It's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets,where people are unregistered, unlicensed,but MTN makes most of its profits,perhaps 90 percent of its profits,from selling through System D, the informal economy.And where do the phones come from?Well, they come from here. This is in Guangzhou, China,and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy lookingelectronics mall, you find the Guangzhou Dashatousecond-hand trade center,and if you go in there, you follow the guys with the muscleswho are carrying the boxes, and where are they going?They're going to Eddy in Lagos.Now, most of the phones there are not second-hand at all.The name is a misnomer.Most of them are pirated. They have the name brandon them, but they're not manufactured by the name brand.Now, are there downsides to that?Well, I guess. You know, China has no —(Laughter) — no intellectual property, right?Versace without the vowels.Zhuomani instead of Armani.S. Guuuci, and -- (Laughter) (Applause)All around the world this is how productsare being distributed, so, for instance,in one street market on Rua 25 de Marçoin São Paulo, Brazil,you can buy fake designer glasses.You can buy cloned cologne.You can buy pirated DVDs, of course.You can buy New York Yankees capsin all sorts of unauthorized patterns.You can buy cuecas baratas, designer underwearthat isn't really manufactured by a designer,and even pirated evangelical mixtapes. (Laughter)Now, businesses tend to complain about this,and their, they, I don't want to take away from theirentire validity of complaining about it,but I did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this yearwhat they thought about piracy,and they told me, "Well, you can't quote me on this,because if you quote me on this, I have to kill you,"but they use piracy as market research.The sneaker manufacturer told me that ifthey find that Pumas are being pirated, or Adidasare being pirated and their sneakers aren't being pirated,they know they've done something wrong. (Laughter)So it's very important to them to track piracyexactly because of this, and the people who are buying,the pirates, are not their customers anyway,because their customers want the real deal.Now, there's another problem.This is a real street sign in Lagos, Nigeria.All of System D really doesn't pay taxes, right?And when I think about that, first of all I think thatgovernment is a social contract between the people andthe government, and if the government isn't transparent,then the people aren't going to be transparent either,but also that we're blaming the little guywho doesn't pay his taxes, and we're not recognizingthat everyone's fudging things all over the world,including some extremely respected businesses,and I'll give you one example.There was one company that paid 4,000 bribesin the first decade of this millennium, anda million dollars in bribes every business day, right?All over the world. And that companywas the big German electronics giant Siemens.So this goes on in the formal economyas well as the informal economy,so it's wrong of us to blame — and I'm not singling outSiemens, I'm saying everyone does it. Okay?I just want to end by saying that if Adam Smithhad framed out a theory of the flea marketinstead of the free market, what would be someof the principles?First, it would be to understand that it could beconsidered a cooperative, and this is a thoughtfrom the Brazilian legal scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger.Cooperative development is a way forward.Secondly, from the [Austrian] anarchist philosopher Paul Feyerabend,facts are relative, and what is a massive rightof self-reliance to a Nigerian businesspersonis considered unauthorized and horrible to other people,and we have to recognize that there are differencesin how people define things and what their facts are.And third is, and I'm taking this fromthe great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg,that alternate economies barter anddifferent kinds of currency, alternate currenciesare also very important, and he talked aboutbuying what he needed just with his good looks.And so I just want to leave you there, and say thatthis economy is a tremendous force for global developmentand we need to think about it that way.Thank you very much.

In Oxford in the 1950s,there was a fantastic doctor, who was very unusual,named Alice Stewart.And Alice was unusual partly because, of course,she was a woman, which was pretty rare in the 1950s.And she was brilliant, she was one of the,at the time, the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians.She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married,after she had kids,and even after she got divorced and was a single parent,she continued her medical work.And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science,the emerging field of epidemiology,the study of patterns in disease.But like every scientist, she appreciatedthat to make her mark, what she needed to dowas find a hard problem and solve it.The hard problem that Alice chosewas the rising incidence of childhood cancers.Most disease is correlated with poverty,but in the case of childhood cancers,the children who were dying seemed mostly to comefrom affluent families.So, what, she wanted to know,could explain this anomaly?Now, Alice had trouble getting funding for her research.In the end, she got just 1,000 poundsfrom the Lady Tata Memorial prize.And that meant she knew she only had one shotat collecting her data.Now, she had no idea what to look for.This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search,so she asked everything she could think of.Had the children eaten boiled sweets?Had they consumed colored drinks?Did they eat fish and chips?Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing?What time of life had they started school?And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back,one thing and one thing only jumped outwith the statistical clarity of a kind thatmost scientists can only dream of.By a rate of two to one,the children who had diedhad had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant.Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom.Conventional wisdom heldthat everything was safe up to a point, a threshold.It flew in the face of conventional wisdom,which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technologyof that age, which was the X-ray machine.And it flew in the face of doctors' idea of themselves,which was as people who helped patients,they didn't harm them.Nevertheless, Alice Stewart rushed to publishher preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956.People got very excited, there was talk of the Nobel Prize,and Alice really was in a big hurryto try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could findbefore they disappeared.In fact, she need not have hurried.It was fully 25 years before the British and medical --British and American medical establishmentsabandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women.The data was out there, it was open, it was freely available,but nobody wanted to know.A child a week was dying,but nothing changed.Openness alone can't drive change.So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands.So, how did she know that she was right?Well, she had a fantastic model for thinking.She worked with a statistician named George Kneale,and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn't.So, Alice was very outgoing and sociable,and George was a recluse.Alice was very warm, very empathetic with her patients.George frankly preferred numbers to people.But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship.He said, "My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong."He actively sought disconfirmation.Different ways of looking at her models,at her statistics, different ways of crunching the datain order to disprove her.He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories.Because it was only by not being able to provethat she was wrong,that George could give Alice the confidence she neededto know that she was right.It's a fantastic model of collaboration --thinking partners who aren't echo chambers.I wonder how many of us have,or dare to have, such collaborators.Alice and George were very good at conflict.They saw it as thinking.So what does that kind of constructive conflict require?Well, first of all, it requires that we find peoplewho are very different from ourselves.That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive,which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves,and it means we have to seek out peoplewith different backgrounds, different disciplines,different ways of thinking and different experience,and find ways to engage with them.That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy.And the more I've thought about this,the more I think, really, that that's a kind of love.Because you simply won't commit that kind of energyand time if you don't really care.And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds.Alice's daughter told methat every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist,they made her think and think and think again."My mother," she said, "My mother didn't enjoy a fight,but she was really good at them."So it's one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship.But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face,many of the biggest disasters that we've experienced,mostly haven't come from individuals,they've come from organizations,some of them bigger than countries,many of them capable of affecting hundreds,thousands, even millions of lives.So how do organizations think?Well, for the most part, they don't.And that isn't because they don't want to,it's really because they can't.And they can't because the people inside of themare too afraid of conflict.In surveys of European and American executives,fully 85 percent of them acknowledgedthat they had issues or concerns at workthat they were afraid to raise.Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke,afraid to get embroiled in argumentsthat they did not know how to manage,and felt that they were bound to lose.Eighty-five percent is a really big number.It means that organizations mostly can't dowhat George and Alice so triumphantly did.They can't think together.And it means that people like many of us,who have run organizations,and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can,mostly fail to get the best out of them.So how do we develop the skills that we need?Because it does take skill and practice, too.If we aren't going to be afraid of conflict,we have to see it as thinking,and then we have to get really good at it.So, recently, I worked with an executive named Joe,and Joe worked for a medical device company.And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on.He thought that it was too complicatedand he thought that its complexitycreated margins of error that could really hurt people.He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help.But when he looked around his organization,nobody else seemed to be at all worried.So, he didn't really want to say anything.After all, maybe they knew something he didn't.Maybe he'd look stupid.But he kept worrying about it,and he worried about it so much that he got to the pointwhere he thought the only thing he could dowas leave a job he loved.In the end, Joe and I found a wayfor him to raise his concerns.And what happened then is what almost alwayshappens in this situation.It turned out everybody had exactly the samequestions and doubts.So now Joe had allies. They could think together.And yes, there was a lot of conflict and debateand argument, but that allowed everyone around the tableto be creative, to solve the problem,and to change the device.Joe was what a lot of people might think ofas a whistle-blower,except that like almost all whistle-blowers,he wasn't a crank at all,he was passionately devoted to the organizationand the higher purposes that that organization served.But he had been so afraid of conflict,until finally he became more afraid of the silence.And when he dared to speak,he discovered much more inside himselfand much more give in the system than he had ever imagined.And his colleagues don't think of him as a crank.They think of him as a leader.So, how do we have these conversations more easilyand more often?Well, the University of Delftrequires that its PhD studentshave to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend.It doesn't really matter what the statements are about,what matters is that the candidates are willing and ableto stand up to authority.I think it's a fantastic system,but I think leaving it to PhD candidatesis far too few people, and way too late in life.I think we need to be teaching these skillsto kids and adults at every stage of their development,if we want to have thinking organizationsand a thinking society.The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we've witnessedrarely come from information that is secret or hidden.It comes from information that is freely available and out there,but that we are willfully blind to,because we can't handle, don't want to handle,the conflict that it provokes.But when we dare to break that silence,or when we dare to see,and we create conflict,we enable ourselves and the people around usto do our very best thinking.Open information is fantastic,open networks are essential.But the truth won't set us freeuntil we develop the skills and the habit and the talentand the moral courage to use it.Openness isn't the end.It's the beginning.(Applause)

Good afternoon.I am not a farmer.(Laughter)I'm not. I'm a parent, I'm a resident and I'm a teacher.And this is my world.And along the way I've started noticing --I'm on my third generation of kids --that they're getting bigger.They're getting sicker.In addition to these complexities,I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I seewho are labeled learning disabled would not have beenhad they had proper prenatal nutrition.The realities of my community are simple. They look like this.Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this.And as jobs continue to leave my community,and energy continues to come in, be exported in,it's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert.But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet,so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasmthat I'm hoping to share with you all today.And with that note, I come to you with this beliefthat kids should not have to leave their communitiesto live, learn and earn in a better one.So I'm here to tell you a story about meand this wall that I met outside, which I'm now bringing inside.And it starts with three people.The crazy teacher -- that's me on the left,I dress up pretty, thank you, my wife, I love you for getting a good suit --my passionate borough presidentand a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologieswho helped me with my classand helped me get involved with this patented technology.But it all starts with seeds in classrooms,in my place, which looks like this.And I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp.And that's really what this is all about.And it starts with incredible kids like this,who come early and stay late.All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners,most come with a lot of handicaps,most are homeless and many are in foster care.Almost all of my kids live below poverty.But with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom,and this is what it looks like in my classroom.And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds.And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this.But again, I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher.And I don't like weeding, and I don't like back-breaking labor.So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of successinto something small, like this,and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it,kids who didn't want to be outside could do it,and everyone could have access.So I called George Irwin, and what do you know?He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall.And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences,private-based learning.And lo and behold, we gave birth tothe first edible wall in New York City.So if you're hungry, get up and eat.You can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time.Okay? But we were just getting started,the kids loved the technology,so we called up George and we said, "We gotta learn more!"Now, Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much, we no longer need work permits,which comes with slices and bonded contractors -- we're available for you --We decided to go to Boston.And my kids, from the poorest congressional district in America,became the first to install a green wall,designed by a computer, with real-live learning tools,21 stories up -- if you're going to go visit it,it's on top of the John Hancock building.But closer to home, we started installing these walls in schoolsthat look like this with lighting like that,real LED stuff, 21st-century technology.And what do you know? We made 21st century money,and that was groundbreaking. Wow!This is my harvest, people.And what do you do with this food? You cook it!And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce,with plastic forks, and we get it into the cafeteria,and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers.And that is the youngest nationally certifiedworkforce in America with our Bronx Borough President.And what'd we do then? Well, I met nice people like you,and they invited us to the Hamptons.So I call this "from South Bronx to Southampton."And we started putting in roofs that look like this,and we came in from destitute neighborhoodsto start building landscape like this, wow! People noticed.And so we got invited back this past summer,and we actually moved into the Hamptons,payed 3,500 dollars a week for a house, and we learned how to surf.And when you can do stuff like this --These are my kids putting in this technology,and when you can build a roof that looks like thaton a house that looks like thatwith sedum that looks like this,this is the new green graffiti.So, you may wonder what does a wall like thisreally do for kids, besides changing landscapes and mindsets?Okay, I'm going to tell you what it does.It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this,Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services.And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line.Because Jim realized that these kids, my future farmers,really had the skills he needed to build affordable housingfor New Yorkers, right in their own neighborhood.And this is what my kids are doing, making living wage.Now, if you're like me, you live in a building, there are seven guysout of work looking to manage a million dollars.I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixedor, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six monthsfor an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me.That's the beauty of this economy.But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade.And that's my first student to open up, the first in his family to have a bank account.This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM.And this is the true triple bottom line,because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destituteand turn them into something like this with interiors like this.Wow! People noticed. And notice they did.So CNN called, and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market.And then when Rockefeller Center said, NBC,could you put this thing up on the walls? We were delighted.But this, I show you, when kids from the poorest congressional district in Americacan build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall,design it, plant it and install it in the heart of New York City,that's a true "sí se puede" moment.Really scholastic, if you ask me.But this is not a Getty image.That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President,addressing my kids in his house, not the jailhouse,making them feel a part of it.That's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder,coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important.And when the Bronx Borough President shows upand the State Senator comes to our class,believe you me, the Bronx can change attitudes now.We are poised, ready, willing and ableto export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined.And when the local senator gets on the scale in publicand says he's got to lose weight, so do I!And I tell you what, I'm doing it and so are the kids.Okay? And then celebrities started.Produce Pete can't believe what we grow.Lorna Sass came and donated books.Okay? We're feeding seniors.And when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx,so did the international community.And my kids in the South Bronx were repped inthe first international green roof conference.And that's just great.Except what about locally?Well, we met this woman, Avis Richards, with the Ground Up Campaign.Unbelievable! Through her, my kids,the most disenfranchised and marginalized,were able to roll out 100 gardens to New York City public schools.That's triple bottom line! Okay?A year ago today, I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine.I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New Yorkmade sense, especially when the resources were free.So thank you all and I love them.They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health,again, free resources, don't waste them.And what do you know? Six months later,my school and my kids were awarded the first everhigh school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment.The greenest class in New York City.But more importantly is my kids learned to get,they learned to give.And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market,and started buying gifts for the homelessand for needy around the world.So we started giving back.And that's when I realized that the greening of Americastarts first with the pockets, then with the heartand then with the mind.So we were onto something, and we're still onto something.And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed,because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine.We're 3,000 strong right now.And what does it really do?It teaches kids to re-vision their communities,so when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this.And my kids, trained and certified --Ma, you get the tax abatement. Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg --can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that,and that to me, people, is another true "sí se puede" moment.Now, how does it start? It starts in schools.No more little Knicks and little Nets.Group by broccoli, group by your favorite vegetable,something you can aspire to.Okay? And these are my future farmers of America,growing up in Brook Park on 141st Street,the most migrant community in America.When tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this,it's no wonder we get fruit like that.And I love it! And so do they.And we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down.And that's a true "sí se puede" moment.And again, Brook Park feeds hundreds of peoplewithout a food stamp or a fingerprint.The poorest congressional district in America,the most migratory community in America, we can do this.Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions,moving kids into an economy they never imagined.Now, somewhere over the rainbow, my friends,is the South Bronx of America. And we're doing it.How does it start? Well, look at Jose's attention to detail.Thank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground,and not aisle 9 at the supermarketor through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam.And when Henry knows that green is good, so do I.And when you expand their palates, you expand their vocabulary.And most importantly, when you put big kids together with little kids,you get the big fat white guy out of the middle, which is cool,and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers, which is incredible.God, I'm going to run out of time, so I've gotta keep it moving.But this is my weekly paycheck for kids; that's our green graffiti.This is what we're doing.And behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County.Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other.I gotta tell you, I'm a protective parent.But those kids are the kids who are now puttingpumpkin patches on top of trains.We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent.We're also becoming children of the corn,creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awarenessand window bottles out of garbage.Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer,but I expect you to read about it, write about it, blog about it, offer outstanding customer service.I expect them to be engaged, and man, are they!So that's my incredible classroom, that's the food.Where does it go? Zero miles to plate, right down into the cafeteria.Or more importantly, to local shelters,where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day.And we're stepping it up.No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm.And in his day, a million dollar gardens and incredible installations.Let me tell you something, people.This is a beautiful moment.Black field, brown field, toxic waste field, battlefield --we're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere, on cement.And we take orders for flowers. I'm putting the bake sale to shame.We take orders now. I'm booking for the spring.And these were all grown from seeds. We're learning everything.And again, when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverseas this to do something as special as this,we're really creating a moment.Now, you may ask about these kids.Forty percent attendance to 93 percent attendance.All start overage and under-credit.They are now, my first cohort is all in college, earning a living wage.The rest are scheduled to graduate this June.Happy kids, happy families, happy colleagues.Amazed people. The glory and bounty that is Bronx County.Let's talk about mint. Where is my mint?I grow seven kinds of mint in my class.Mojitos, anybody? I'll be at Telepan later.But, understand this is my intellectual Viagra.Ladies and gentlemen, I gotta move quick, but understand this:The borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beatsis becoming home to the organic ones.My green [unclear] 25,000 pounds of vegetables,I'm growing organic citizens, engaged kids.So help us go from this to this.Self-sustaining entities, 18 months return on investment,plus we're paying people living wage and health benefits,while feeding people for pennies on the dollar.Martin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity.So here in New York, I urge you, my fellow Americans,to help us make America great again.It's simple. Share your passion.It's real easy. Go see these two videos, please.One got us invited to the White House, one's a recent incarnation.And most importantly, get the biggest bully out of schools.This has got to go tomorrow.People, you can all do that.Keep kids out of stores that look like this.Make them a healthy plate,especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom -- delicioso!Model good behavior. Get them to a green cart.Big kids love strawberries and bananas.Teach them entrepreneurship. Thank God for GrowNYC.Let them cook. Great lunch today, let them do culinary things.But most importantly, just love them.Nothing works like unconditional love.So, my good friend Kermit said it's not easy being green.It's not. I come from a place where kids can buy35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment,where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor.Okay? My dear friend Majora Carter once told me,we have everything to gain and nothing to lose.So here, and at a time when we've gone fromthe audacity to hope to hope for some audacity,I urge you to do something.I urge you to do something.Right now, we're all tadpoles,but I urge you to become a big frog and take that big, green leap.I don't care if you're on the left, on the right, up the middle, wherever.Join me. Use -- I've got a lot of energy. Help me use it.We can do something here.And along the way, please take time to smell the flowers,especially if you and your students grew them.I'm Steve Ritz, this is Green Bronx Machine.I've got to say thank you to my wife and family, for my kids,thank you for coming every day, and for my colleagues,believing and supporting me.We are growing our way into a new economy.Thank you, God bless you and enjoy the day. I'm Steve Ritz.Sí se puede!(Applause)

Two thousand and seven, five years ago,my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer.Stage IIB.was not just the hospital visits --at just 39 years old,that were being thrust upon us.given that it was stage IIB?With all the side effects?Now you could ask this question,why were the doctors doing this?A simplistic answer would be,the doctors are doing thisI think that is too simplistic.These are well-meaning doctors,that has come down through the ages,especially decisions of importance,it's best to be in the driver's seat.making all these decisions.Which got me thinking.that when you're making decisions,it's best to take the driver's seat,be in charge, be in control?taking the passenger's seatand have someone else drive?For example, a trusted financial advisor,could be a trusted doctor, etc.And since I study human decision making,I said, I'm going to run some studiesto find some answers.you're going to drink a cup of tea.And the more puzzles you solve,Now, why do you have to consume the tea?Why? Because it makes a lot of sense:It needs to be alert,for which caffeine is very good.Simultaneously, it needs to be calm --not agitated, calm --for which chamomile is very good.Now comes the between-subjects design,the AB design, the AB testing.so everyone here will be group A,everyone out here will be group B.So you can choose whichever tea you want.You can decide, what is your mental state:OK, I choose the caffeinated tea,I choose the chamomile tea.you're going to be in the driver's seat.but you don't have a choice.at random for you.And you know that.because in the real world,whenever you are taking passenger's seat,an expert, etc.So this is an extreme-case scenario.Now, you're all going to consume the tea.So imagine that you're taking the tea now,we'll wait for you to finish the tea.That's cool.as a participant,of the puzzles to your expertise.These are tricky puzzles,And then you have to unstick yourself.Right?because we want this to be difficult,and I'll tell you why, momentarily.Now, here's another example.Anyone? This is much more difficult.So, yeah, so this is, again, difficult.and then you can unstick yourself.because you are in control,or would you be better off,in terms of the number of puzzles solved?And, systemically, what we will show,across a series of studies,is that you, the passengers,We also observe another thing,you're less persistent, and so on.How do we know that?Well, we have two objective measures.in attempting to solve these puzzles?You will spend less time compared to you.are you taking the entire 30 minutescompared to you.So you're putting in less juice,compared to the driver?after you made the decision.very volatile out there,it could be the medical situation --the feedback here is immediate.Right? Second, it is negative.And this can happen in the medical domain.Right? It can happen in the stock market.Now, the added one,now you have a sense of agency.You were responsible for your decision.So what do you do?You focus on the foregone option.You say, you know what?I should have chosen the other tea.(Laughter)That casts your decision in doubt,And therefore less juice into the task,fewer puzzles solvedwhich is what is often advocated.You probably wouldn't do that.and you have the sense of agency,and have someone else drive.Now, I started off on a somber note.I want to finish up on a more upbeat note.So it all ends well.And that made so much of a differencewe could focus on her recovery.We let the doctors make all the decisionsand take the driver's seat.Thank you.(Applause)

Openness. It's a word thatdenotes opportunity and possibilities.Open-ended, open hearth,open source, open door policy,open bar. (Laughter)And everywhere the world is opening up,and it's a good thing.Why is this happening?The technology revolution is opening the world.Yesterday's Internet was a platformfor the presentation of content.The Internet of today is a platform for computation.The Internet is becoming a giantglobal computer, and every time you go on it,you upload a video, you do a Google search,you remix something,you're programming this big global computerthat we all share.Humanity is building a machine,and this enables us to collaborate in new ways.Collaboration can occur onan astronomical basis.Now a new generation is opening up the world as well.I started studying kids about 15 years ago,-- so actually 20 years ago now --and I noticed how my own children wereeffortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology,and at first I thought,"My children are prodigies!" (Laughter)But then I noticed all their friends were like them,so that was a bad theory.So I've started working with a few hundred kids,and I came to the conclusionthat this is the first generation to come of agein the digital age,to be bathed in bits.I call them the Net Generation.I said, these kids are different.They have no fear of technology, because it's not there.It's like the air.It's sort of like, I have no fear of a refrigerator.And — (Laughter)And there's no more powerful force to changeevery institution than the first generation of digital natives.I'm a digital immigrant.I had to learn the language.The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well.Our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age,everything from old models of the corporation,government, media, Wall Street,are in various stages of being stalled or frozenor in atrophy or even failing,and this is now creating a burning platform in the world.I mean, think about Wall Street.The core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought downglobal capitalism.Now, you know the idea of a burning platform,that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you arebecome greater than the costs of moving to something different,perhaps something radically different.And we need to changeand open up all of our institutions.So this technology push,a demographic kick from a new generationand a demand pull from a neweconomic global environmentis causing the world to open up.Now, I think, in fact,we're at a turning point in human history,where we can finally now rebuildmany of the institutions of the Industrial Agearound a new set of principles.Now, what is openness?Well, as it turns out, opennesshas a number of different meanings,and for each there's a corresponding principlefor the transformation ofcivilization.The first is collaboration.Now, this is openness in the sense of the boundariesof organizations becoming more porous and fluidand open.The guy in the picture here,I'll tell you his story.His name is Rob McEwen.I'd like to say, "I have this think tank, we scour the worldfor amazing case studies."The reason I know this storyis because he's my neighbor. (Laughter)He actually moved across the street from us,and he held a cocktail partyto meet the neighbors, and he says, "You're Don Tapscott.I've read some of your books."I said, "Great. What do you do?"And he says, "Well I used to be a bankerand now I'm a gold miner."And he tells me this amazing story.He takes over this gold mine, and his geologistscan't tell him where the gold is.He gives them more money for geological data,they come back, they can't tellhim where to go into production.After a few years, he's so frustrated he's readyto give up, but he has an epiphany one day.He wonders, "If my geologists don't know where the gold is,maybe somebody else does."So he does a "radical" thing.He takes his geological data,he publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internetcalled the Goldcorp Challenge.It's basically half a million dollars in prize moneyfor anybody who can tell me, do I have any gold,and if so, where is it? (Laughter)He gets submissions from all around the world.They use techniques that he's never heard of,and for his half a million dollars in prize money,Rob McEwen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold.The market value of his companygoes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars,and I can tell you, because he's my neighbor,he's a happy camper. (Laughter)You know, conventional wisdom says talent is inside, right?Your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night.He viewed talent differently.He wondered, who are their peers?He should have fired his geology department, but he didn't.You know, some of the best submissionsdidn't come from geologists.They came from computer scientists, engineers.The winner was a computer graphics companythat built a three dimensional model of the minewhere you can helicopter undergroundand see where the gold is.He helped us understand that social media's becomingsocial production.It's not about hooking up online.This is a new means of production in the making.And this Ideagora that he created, an open market, agora,for uniquely qualified minds,was part of a change, a profound change in the deep structureand architecture of our organizations,and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate,to create goods and services,to engage with the rest of the world,in terms of government, how we create public value.Openness is about collaboration.Now secondly, openness is about transparency.This is different. Here, we're talking about the communicationof pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations:employees, customers, business partners, shareholders,and so on.And everywhere, our institutions are becoming naked.People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks,but that's just the tip of the iceberg.You see, people at their fingertips now, everybody,not just Julian Assange,have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on,scrutinizing, informing others,and even organizing collective responses.Institutions are becoming naked,and if you're going to be naked,well, there's some corollaries that flow from that.I mean, one is,fitness is no longer optional. (Laughter)You know? Or if you're going to be naked, you'd better get buff.Now, by buff I mean, you need to have good value,because value is evidenced like never before.You say you have good products.They'd better be good.But you also need to have values.You need to have integrity as part of your bonesand your DNA as an organization,because if you don't, you'll be unable to build trust,and trust is a sine qua non of this new network world.So this is good. It's not bad.Sunlight is the best disinfectant.And we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world.Now, the third meaning and corresponding principleof openness is about sharing.Now this is different than transparency.Transparency is about the communication of information.Sharing is about giving up assets, intellectual property.And there are all kinds of famous stories about this.IBM gave away 400 million dollars of softwareto the Linux movement, and that gave thema multi-billion dollar payoff.Now, conventional wisdom says,"Well, hey, our intellectual property belongs to us,and if someone tries to infringe it, we're going to get outour lawyers and we're going to sue them."Well, it didn't work so well for the record labels, did it?I mean, they took — They had a technology disruption,and rather than taking a business model innovationto correspond to that, they took and sought a legal solutionand the industry that brought you Elvis and the Beatlesis now suing childrenand is in danger of collapse.So we need to think differently about intellectual property.I'll give you an example.The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble.First of all, there aren't a lot of big inventionsin the pipeline, and this is a big problem for human health,and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem,that they're about to fall off somethingcalled the patent cliff.Do you know about this?They're going to lose 20 to 35 percent of their revenuein the next 12 months.And what are you going to do,like, cut back on paper clips or something? No.We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research.The pharmaceutical industry needs to place assetsin a commons. They need to start sharing precompetitive research.They need to start sharingclinical trial data,and in doing so, create a rising tide that could lift all boats,not just for the industry butfor humanity.Now, the fourth meaningof openness,and corresponding principle, is about empowerment.And I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here.Knowledge and intelligence is power,and as it becomes more distributed, there's aconcomitant distributionand decentralization and disaggregation of powerthat's underway in the world today.The open world is bringing freedom.Now, take the Arab Spring.The debate about the role of social mediaand social change has been settled.You know, one word: Tunisia.And then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too.But in the Tunisian revolution,the new media didn't cause the revolution;it was caused by injustice.Social media didn't create the revolution;it was created by a new generation of young peoplewho wanted jobs and hope andwho didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore.But just as the Internet drops transaction and collaborationcosts in business and government,it also drops the cost of dissent, of rebellion,and even insurrectionin ways that people didn't understand.You know, during the Tunisian revolution,snipers associated with the regime were killingunarmed students in the street.So the students would take their mobile devices,take a picture, triangulate the location,send that picture to friendly military units,who'd come in and take out the snipers.You think that social media is about hooking up online?For these kids, it was a military toolto defend unarmed people from murderers.It was a tool of self-defense.You know, as we speak today, young peopleare being killed in Syria,and up until three months ago,if you were injured on the street,an ambulance would pick you up,take you to the hospital, you'd go in, say, with a broken leg,and you'd come out with a bullet in your head.So these 20-somethings createdan alternative health care system,where what they did is they used Twitter and basicpublicly available tools that when someone's injured,a car would show up, it would pick them up,take them to a makeshift medical clinic, where you'd getmedical treatment, as opposed to being executed.So this is a time of great change.Now, it's not without its problems.Up until two years ago,all revolutions in human history had a leadership,and when the old regime fell, the leadershipand the organization would take power.Well, these wiki revolutions happen so fastthey create a vacuum, andpolitics abhors a vacuum,and unsavory forces can fill that,typically the old regime,or extremists, or fundamentalist forces.You can see this playing out today in Egypt.But that doesn't matter,because this is moving forward.The train has left the station. The cat is out of the bag.The horse is out of the barn. Help me out here, okay?(Laughter) The toothpaste is out of the tube.I mean, we're not putting this one back.The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom.I think, at the end of these four days,that you'll come to conclude that the arc of historyis a positive one, and it's towards openness.If you go back a few hundred years,all around the world it was a very closed society.It was agrarian, and the means of productionand political system was called feudalism, and knowledgewas concentrated in the church and the nobility.People didn't know about things.There was no concept of progress.You were born, you lived your life and you died.But then Johannes Gutenberg came along with his great invention,and, over time, the society opened up.People started to learn about things, and when they did,the institutions of feudal society appearedto be stalled, or frozen, or failing.It didn't make sense for the church to be responsiblefor medicine when people had knowledge.So we saw the Protestant Reformation.Martin Luther called the printing press"God's highest act of grace."The creation of a corporation, science, the university,eventually the Industrial Revolution,and it was all good.But it came with a cost.And now, once again, the technology genieis out of the bottle, but this time it's different.The printing press gave us access to the written word.The Internet enables each of us to be a producer.The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge.The Internet gives us access,not just to information and knowledge, butto the intelligence contained in the crania of other peopleon a global basis.To me, this is not an information age,it's an age of networked intelligence.It's an age of vast promise,an age of collaboration,where the boundaries of our organizations are changing,of transparency, where sunlightis disinfecting civilization,an age of sharing and understandingthe new power of the commons,and it's an age of empowermentand of freedom.Now, what I'd like to do is,to close, to share with yousome research that I've been doing.I've tried to study all kinds of organizationsto understand what the future might look like,but I've been studying nature recently.You know, bees come in swarmsand fish come in schools.Starlings, in the area around Edinburgh,in the moors of England,come in something called a murmuration,and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wingsof the birds, and throughout the day the starlingsare out over a 20-mile radiussort of doing their starling thing.And at night they come togetherand they create one of the most spectacular thingsin all of nature,and it's called a murmuration.And scientists that have studied this have saidthey've never seen an accident.Now, this thing has a function.It protects the birds.You can see on the right here,there's a predator being chased away by the collective powerof the birds, and apparently this is a frightening thingif you're a predator of starlings.And there's leadership,but there's no one leader.Now, is this some kind of fanciful analogy,or could we actually learn something from this?Well, the murmuration functions to recorda number of principles,and they're basically the principles thatI have described to you today.This is a huge collaboration.It's an openness, it's a sharingof all kinds of information, not just about locationand trajectory and danger and so on, but about food sources.And there's a real sense of interdependence,that the individual birds somehow understandthat their interests are in the interest of the collective.Perhaps like we should understandthat business can't succeedin a world that's failing.Well, I look at this thing,and I get a lot of hope.Think about the kids today in the Arab Spring, andyou see something like this that's underway.And imagine, just consider this idea, if you would:What if we could connect ourselves in this worldthrough a vast network of air and glass?Could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge?Could we start to share our intelligence?Could we create some kind ofcollective intelligencethat goes beyond an individual or a group or a teamto create, perhaps, some kind of consciousnesson a global basis?Well, if we could do this, we could attack some big problems in the world.And I look at this thing,and, I don't know, I get a lot of hope that maybe thissmaller, networked, open worldthat our kids inherit might be a better one, and thatthis new age of networked intelligence could bean age of promise fulfilledand of peril unrequited.Let's do this. Thank you.(Applause)

Over the last two decades, India has becomea global hub for software developmentand offshoring of back office services, as we call it,and what we were interested in finding out was thatbecause of this huge industry that has startedover the last two decades in India,offshoring software development and back office services,there's been a flight of white collar jobsfrom the developed world to India.When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobsto China, it has, you know, led to considerable angstamongst the Western populations.In fact, if you look at polls, they show a decliningtrend for support for free trade in the West.Now, the Western elites, however, have saidthis fear is misplaced.For example, if you have read — I suspect many of youhave done so — read the book by Thomas Friedmancalled "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his bookthat, you know, this fear for free trade is wrongbecause it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumptionthat everything that can be invented has been invented.In fact, he says, it's innovation that will keep the Westahead of the developing world,with the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being donein the developed world, and the less sophisticated,shall we say, drudge work being donein the developing world.Now, what we were trying to understand was,is this true?Could India become a source, or a global hub,of innovation, just like it's become a global hubfor back office services and software development?And for the last four years, my coauthor Phanish Puranamand I spent investigating this topic.Initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know,in fact the more aggressive people who are supportingthe Western innovative model, say,"Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras,if the Indians are so bloody smart?" (Laughter)So initially, when we started our research, we wentand met several executives, and we asked them,"What do you think? Will India go from being a favoreddestination for software services and back office servicesto a destination for innovation?"They laughed. They dismissed us.They said, "You know what? Indians don't do innovation."The more polite ones said, "Well, you know, Indiansmake good software programmers and accountants,but they can't do the creative stuff."Sometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication,and people said, "You know, it's nothing to do with Indians.It's really the rule-based, regimented education systemin India that is responsible for killing all creativity."They said, instead, if you want to see real creativity,go to Silicon Valley, and look at companieslike Google, Microsoft, Intel.So we started examining the R&amp;amp;D and innovation labsof Silicon Valley.Well, interestingly, what you find there is,usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation labor the R&amp;amp;D center as they may call it,and more often than not, it's an Indian. (Laughter)So I immediately said, "Well, but you could not have beeneducated in India, right?You must have gotten your education here."It turned out, in every single case,they came out of the Indian educational system.So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question,and the right question is, really, can Indiansbased out of India do innovative work?So off we went to India. We made, I think,about a dozen trips to Bangalore, Mumbai, Gurgaon,Delhi, Hyderabad, you name it, to examinewhat is the level of corporate innovation in these cities.And what we found was, as we progressed in our research,was, that we were asking really the wrong question.When you ask, "Where are the Indian Googles,iPods and Viagras?" you are taking a particular perspectiveon innovation, which is innovation for end users,visible innovation.Instead, innovation, if you remember, some of youmay have read the famous economist Schumpeter,he said, "Innovation is noveltyin how value is created and distributed."It could be new products and services,but it could also be new ways of producing products.It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.Once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation,the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation,what we found was, India is well representedin innovation, but the innovation that is being done in Indiais of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did waswe called it "invisible innovation."And specifically, there are four types of invisible innovationthat are coming out of India.The first type of invisible innovation out of Indiais what we call innovation for business customers,which is led by the multinational corporations,which have -- in the last two decades, there have been750 R&amp;amp;D centers set up in India by multinational companiesemploying more than 400,000 professionals.Now, when you consider the fact that, historically,the R&amp;amp;D center of a multinational companywas always in the headquarters, or in the country of originof that multinational company, to have 750 R&amp;amp;D centersof multinational corporations in Indiais truly a remarkable figure.When we went and talked to the people in those innovationcenters and asked them what are they working on,they said, "We are working on global products."They were not working on localizing global productsfor India, which is the usual role of a local R&amp;amp;D.They were working on truly global products,and companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca,General Electric, Philips, have already answeredin the affirmative the question that from their Bangaloreand Hyderabad R&amp;amp;D centers they are able to produceproducts and services for the world.But of course, as an end user, you don't see that,because you only see the name of the company,not where it was developed.The other thing we were told then was, "Yes, but, you know,the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&amp;amp;D centercannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming outof the U.S. R&amp;amp;D centers."So my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to beone of the smartest people I know, saidhe's going to do a study.What he did was he looked at those companiesthat had an R&amp;amp;D center in USA and in India,and then he looked at a patent that was filedout of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the samecompany's subsidiary in India,so he's now comparing the patents of R&amp;amp;D centersin the U.S. with R&amp;amp;D centers in India of the same companyto find out what is the quality of the patents filedout of the Indian centers and how do they comparewith the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers?Interestingly, what he finds is— and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patentis what we call forward citations: How many timesdoes a future patent reference the older patent? —he finds something very interesting.What we find is that the data saysthat the number of forward citations of a patent filedout of a U.S. R&amp;amp;D subsidiary is identical to the numberof forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiaryof the same company within that company.So within the company, there's no difference in the forwardcitation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versustheir U.S. subsidiaries.So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India.The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of Indiais what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies,where many companies today are contractingIndian companies to do a major part of their productdevelopment work for their global productswhich are going to be sold to the entire world.For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the moleculesare being developed, but you see a major part of that workis being sent to India.For example, XCL Technologies,they developed two of the mission critical systemsfor the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner,one to avoid collisions in the sky,and another to allow landing in zero visibility.But of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787,you are not going to know that this is invisible innovationout of India.The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of Indiais what we call process innovations, because of an injectionof intelligence by Indian firms.Process innovation is different from product innovation.It's about how do you create a new product or developa new product or manufacture a new product,but not a new product itself?Only in India do millions of young people dreamof working in a call center.What happens — You know, it's a dead end job in the West,what high school dropouts do.What happens when you put hundreds of thousandsof smart, young, ambitious kidson a call center job?Very quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating,and they start telling the boss how to do this job better, andout of this process innovation comes product innovations,which are then marketed around the world.For example, 24/7 Customer,traditional call center company, used to be a traditionalcall center company. Today they're developinganalytical tools to do predictive modeling so that beforeyou pick up the phone, you can guessor predict what this phone call is about.It's because of an injection of intelligence into a processwhich was considered dead for a long time in the West.And the last kind of innovation, invisible innovationcoming out of India is what we call management innovation.It's not a new product or a new processbut a new way to organize work,and the most significant management innovation to comeout of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industryis what we call the global delivery model.What the global delivery model allows is, it allows youto take previously geographically core-located tasks,break them up into parts, send them around the worldwhere the expertise and the cost structure exists,and then specify the means for reintegrating them.Without that, you could not have any of the otherinvisible innovations today.So, what I'm trying to say is, what we are findingin our research is, that if products for end usersis the visible tip of the innovation iceberg,India is well represented in the invisible, large,submerged portion of the innovation iceberg.Now, this has, of course, some implications,and so we developed three implications of this research.The first is what we called sinking skill ladder,and now I'm going to go back to where I started myconversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs.Now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company,decide to outsource jobs to India in the R&amp;amp;D,what we are going to do is we are going to outsource thebottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs,just like Tom Friedman would predict.Now, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rungof the ladder to India for innovation and for R&amp;amp;D work,at some stage in the very near future you are going to haveto confront a problem,which is where does the next stepof the ladder people come from within your company?So you have two choices then:Either you bring the people from India intothe developed world to take positions in the next stepof the ladder — immigration —or you say, there's so many people in the bottom stepof the ladder waiting to take the next position in India,why don't we move the next step to India?What we are trying to say isthat once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you --it's a self-perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder,and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point thatyou can't be an investment bankerwithout having been an analyst once.You can't be a professor without having been a student.You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate.So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs,at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.The second thing we bring up is what we callthe browning of the TMT, the top management teams.If the R&amp;amp;D talent is going to be based out of Indiaand China, and the largest growth marketsare going to be based out of India and China,you have to confront the problem thatyour top management of the futureis going to have to come out of India and China,because that's where the product leadership is,that's where the important market leadership is.Right? And the last thing we point out in this slide,which is, you know, that to this story, there's one caveat.India has the youngest growing population in the world.This demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically,there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools.Indian institutes and educational system,with a few exceptions, are incapable of producing studentsin the quantity and quality neededto keep this innovation engine going,so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this,but in the end it does not absolve the governmentof the responsibility for creating this educational structure.So finally, I want to concludeby showing you the profile of one company, IBM.As many of you know, IBM has always been consideredfor the last hundred years to be one of the mostinnovative companies.In fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history,I think they are in the top or the top two or three companiesin the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company.Here is the profile of employees ofIBM over the last decade.In 2003, they had 300,000 employees,or 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000were in America, 9,000 were in India.In 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which timethe U.S. employees had moved to 105,000,whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000.Well, in 2010, they decided they're not going to revealthis data anymore, so I had to make some estimatesbased on various sources.Here are my best guesses. Okay? I'm not sayingthis is the exact number, it's my best guess.It gives you a sense of the trend.There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which98,000 are remaining in the U.S.,and 150,000 are in India.So you tell me, is IBM an American company,or an Indian company? (Laughter)Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. (Applause)

I don't know why, but I'm continually amazed to thinkthat two and a half billion of us around the worldare connected to each other through the Internetand that at any point in timemore than 30 percent of the world's populationcan go online to learn, to create and to share.And the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of thisis also continuing to go grow.A recent study showedthat the young generation aloneis spending over eight hours a day online.As the parent of a nine-year-old girl,that number seems awfully low.(Laughter)But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us,it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world.And increasingly, the price we're being asked to payfor all of this connectednessis our privacy.Today, what many of us would love to believeis that the Internet is a private place; it's not.And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen,we are like Hansel and Gretelleaving breadcrumbs of our personal informationeverywhere we travel through the digital woods.We are leaving our birthdays, our places of residence,our interests and preferences,our relationships,our financial histories, and on and on it goes.Now don't get me wrong,I'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing.In fact, when I know the data that's being sharedand I'm asked explicitly for my consent,I want some sites to understand my habits.It helps them suggest books for me to reador movies for my family to watchor friends for us to connect with.But when I don't know and when I haven't been asked,that's when the problem arises.It's a phenomenon on the Internet todaycalled behavioral tracking,and it is very big business.In fact, there's an entire industry formedaround following us through the digital woodsand compiling a profile on each of us.And when all of that data is held,they can do almost whatever they want with it.This is an area today that has very few regulationsand even fewer rules.Except for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe,it's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked.So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further.The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusionand it's an experimental browser add-onthat you can install in your Firefox browserthat helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you.The red dots you see up thereare sites that are behavioral trackingthat I have not navigated to, but are following me.The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to.And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me,but I have no idea who they are.All of them are connected, as you can see,to form a picture of me on the Web.And this is my profile.So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal.I installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks agoand I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day.Now like most of you,I actually start my day going online and checking email.I then go to a news site, look for some headlines.And in this particular case I happened to like one of themon the merits of music literacy in schoolsand I shared it over a social network.Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table,and I asked her, "Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school?"And she, of course, naturally as a nine-year-old,looked at me and said quizzically, "What's literacy?"So I sent her online, of course, to look it up.Now let me stop here.We are not even two bites into breakfastand there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me.I have navigated to a total of four.So let me fast-forward through the rest of my day.I go to work, I check email,I log onto a few more social sites, I blog,I check more news reports, I share some of those news reports,I go look at some videos,pretty typical day -- in this case, actually fairly pedantic --and at the end of the day, as my day winds down,look at my profile.The red dots have exploded.The gray dots have grown exponentially.All in all, there's over 150 sitesthat are now tracking my personal information,most all of them without my consent.I look at this picture and it freaks me out.This is nothing. I am being stalked across the Web.And why is this happening?Pretty simple -- it's huge business.The revenue of the top handful of companies in this spaceis over 39 billion dollars today.And as adults, we're certainly not alone.At the same time I installed my own Collusion profile,I installed one for my daughter.And on one single Saturday morning, over two hours on the Internet,here's her Collusion profile.This is a nine-year-old girlnavigating to principally children's sites.I move from this, from freaked out to enraged.This is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate;this is me being a parent.Imagine in the physical worldif somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebookand recorded their every movement.I can tell you, there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by.We'd take action. It may not be good action, but we would take action.(Laughter)We can't sit idly by here either.This is happening today.Privacy is not an option,and it shouldn't be the price we acceptfor just getting on the Internet.Our voices matter and our actions matter even more.Today we've launched Collusion.You can download it, install it in Firefox,to see who is tracking you across the Weband following you through the digital woods.Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard.Because what we don't know can actually hurt us.Because the memory of the Internet is forever.We are being watched.It's now time for us to watch the watchers.Thank you.(Applause)

America's public energy conversationboils down to this question:Would you rather die of A) oil wars,or B) climate change,or C) nuclear holocaust,or D) all of the above?Oh, I missed one: or E) none of the above?That's the one we're not normally offered.What if we could make energy do our workwithout working our undoing?Could we have fuel without fear?Could we reinvent fire?You see, fire made us human;fossil fuels made us modern.But now we need a new firethat makes us safe, secure, healthy and durable.Let's see how.Four-fifths of the world's energystill comes from burning each yearfour cubic miles of the rotted remainsof primeval swamp goo.Those fossil fuelshave built our civilization.They've created our wealth.They've enriched the lives of billions.But they also have rising coststo our security, economy, health and environmentthat are starting to erode, if not outweigh their benefits.So we need a new fire.And switching from the old fire to the new firemeans changing two big stories about oil and electricity,each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air.But they're really quite distinct.Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil --although almost half is made from coal.Their uses are quite concentrated.Three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation.Three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings.And the rest of both runs factories.So very efficient vehicles, buildings and factoriessave oil and coal,and also natural gas that can displace both of them.But today's energy system is not just inefficient,it is also disconnected,aging, dirty and insecure.So it needs refurbishment.By 2050 though, it could become efficient,connected and distributedwith elegantly frugalautos, factories and buildingsall relying on a modern, secureand resilient electricity system.We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050and use one-third less natural gaswhile switching to efficient useand renewable supply.This could cost, by 2050,five trillion dollars less in net present value,that is expressed as a lump sum today,than business as usual --assuming that carbon emissionsand all other hidden or external costs are worth zero --a conservatively low estimate.Yet this cheaper energy systemcould support 158 percent bigger U.S. economyall without needing oil or coal,or for that matter nuclear energy.Moreover, this transition needs no new inventionsand no acts of Congressand no new federal taxes, mandate subsidies or lawsand running Washington gridlock.Let me say that again.I'm going to tell you how to get the United Statescompletely off oil and coal, five trillion dollars cheaperwith no act of Congressled by business for profit.In other words, we're going to use our most effective institutions --private enterprise co-evolving with civil societyand sped by military innovationto go around our least effective institutions.And whether you care mostabout profits and jobs and competitive advantageor national security, or environmental stewardshipand climate protection and public health,reinventing fire makes sense and makes money.General Eisenhower reputedly saidthat enlarging the boundaries of a tough problemmakes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies.So in reinventing fire,we integrated all four sectors that use energy --transportation, buildings, industry and electricity --and we integrated four kinds of innovation,not just technology and policy,but also design and business strategy.Those combinations yieldvery much more than the sum of the parts,especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities.Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day,plus another four billion dollars a dayin hidden economic and military costs,raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP.Our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles.So let's start by making autos oil free.Two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical caris caused by its weight.And every unit of energy you save at the wheels,by taking out weight or drag,saves seven units in the tank,because you don't have to waste six unitsgetting the energy to the wheels.Unfortunately, over the past quarter century,epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel carsgain weight twice as fast as we have.But today, ultralight, ultrastrong materials,like carbon fiber composites,can make dramatic weight savings snowballand can make cars simpler and cheaper to build.Lighter and more slippery autosneed less force to move them,so their engines get smaller.Indeed, that sort of vehicle fitnessthen makes electric propulsion affordablebecause the batteries or fuel cellsalso get smaller and lighter and cheaper.So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today,while the driving cost, even from the start,is very much lower.So these innovations together can transform automakersfrom wringing tiny savingsout of Victorian engine and seal-stamping technologiesto the steeply falling costsof three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other --namely ultralight materials, making them into structuresand electric propulsion.The sales can grow and the prices fall even fasterwith temporary feebates,that is rebates for efficient new autospaid for by fees on inefficient ones.And just in the first two yearsthe biggest of Europe's five feebate programshas tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency.The resulting shift to electric autosis going to be as game-changingas shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers.Of course, computers and electronicsare now America's biggest industry,while typewriter makers have vanished.So vehicle fitnessopens a new automotive competitive strategythat can double the oil savings over the next 40 years,but then also make electrification affordable,and that displaces the rest of the oil.America could lead this next automotive revolution.Currently the leader is Germany.Last year, Volkswagen announcedthat by next year they'll be producingthis carbon fiber plugin hybridgetting 230 miles a gallon.Also last year, BMW announcedthis carbon fiber electric car,they said that its carbon fiber is paid forby needing fewer batteries.And they said, "We do not intend to be a typewriter maker."Audi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year.Seven years ago, an even faster and cheaperAmerican manufacturing technologywas used to make this little carbon fiber test part,which doubles as a carbon cap.(Laughter)In one minute -- and you can tell from the soundhow immensely stiff and strong it is.Don't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium.Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammerwithout even scuffing it.But such manufacturing techniquescan scale to automotive speed and costwith aerospace performance.They can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos.They can save livesbecause this stuff can absorbup to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel.If we made all of our autos this way,it would save oil equivalent to findingone and a half Saudi Arabias, or half an OPEC,by drilling in the Detroit formation, a very prospective play.And all those mega-barrels under Detroitcost an average of 18 bucks a barrel.They are all-American, carbon-freeand inexhaustible.The same physics and the same business logicalso apply to big vehicles.In the five years ending with 2010,Walmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-milein its giant fleet of heavy trucksthrough better logistics and design.But just the technological savings in heavy truckscan get to two-thirds.And combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes,now on the drawing board,can save close to a trillion dollars.Also today's military revolution in energy efficiencyis going to speed up all of these civilian advancesin much the same way that military R&amp;Dhas given us the Internet, the Global Positioning Systemand the jet engine and microchip industries.As we design and build vehicles better,we can also use them smarterby harnessing four powerful techniquesfor eliminating needless driving.Instead of just seeing the travel grow,we can use innovative pricing,charging for road infrastructure by the mile, not by the gallon.We can use some smart IT to enhance transitand enable car sharing and ride sharing.We can allow smart and lucrative growth modelsthat help people already be near where they want to be,so they don't need to go somewhere else.And we can use smart ITto make traffic free-flowing.Together, those things can give us the same or better accesswith 46 to 84 percent less driving,saving another 0.4 trillion dollars,plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively.So 40 years hence, when you add it all up,a far more mobile U.S. economycan use no oil.Saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucksrather than buying them for over a hundred,adds up to a $4 trillion net savingcounting all the hidden costs at zero.So to get mobility without oil,to phase out the oil,we can get efficient and then switch fuels.Those 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autoscan use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells,electricity and advanced biofuels.The trucks and planes can realistically usehydrogen or advanced biofuels.The trucks could even use natural gas.But no vehicles will need oil.And the most biofuel we might need,just three million barrels a day,can be made two-thirds from wastewithout displacing any croplandand without harming soil or climate.Our team speeds up these kinds of oil savingsby what we call "institutional acupuncture."We figure out where the business logicis congested and not flowing properly,we stick little needles in it to get it flowing,working with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon.And the long transition is already well under way.In fact, three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil,not in supply, but in demand.And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016.In other words, oil is getting uncompetitive even at low pricesbefore it becomes unavailable even at high prices.But the electrified vehiclesdon't need to burden the electricity grid.Rather, when smart autos exchange electricity and informationthrough smart buildings with smart grids,they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storagethat help the grid integratevarying solar and wind power.So the electrified autosmake the auto and electricity problemseasier to solve together than separately.And they also converge the oil storywith our second big story,saving electricity and then making it differently.And those twin revolutions in electricitywill bring to that sectormore numerous and profound and diverse disruptionsthan any other sector,because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-onwith 20th and 19th century institutions, rules and cultures.Changing how we make electricity gets easierif we need less of it.Most of it now is wastedand the technologies for saving itkeep improving faster than we're installing them.So the unbought efficiency resourcekeeps getting ever bigger and cheaper.But as efficiency in buildings and industrystarts to grow faster than the economy,America's electricity use could actually shrink,even with the little extra use requiredfor those efficient electrified autos.And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends.Over the next 40 years, buildings,which use three-quarters of the electricity,can triple or quadruple their energy productivity,saving 1.4 trillion dollars, net present value,with a 33 percent internal rate of returnor in English,the savings are worth four times what they cost.And industry can accelerate too,doubling its energy productivitywith a 21 percent internal rate of return.The key is a disruptive innovationthat we call integrative designthat often makes very big energy savingscost less than small or no savings.That is, it can give you expanding returns,not diminishing returns.That is how our 2010 retrofitis saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building --remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on siteinto super windows that pass light, but reflect heat.plus better lights and office equipment and suchcut the maximum cooling load by a third.And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger onessaved 17 million dollars ofcapital cost, which helped pay for the other improvementsand reduce the payback to just three years.Integrative design can also increaseenergy savings in industry.Dow's billion-dollar efficiency investmenthas already returned nine billion dollars.But industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollarsof energy still to save.For example, three-fifths of the world's electricity runs motors.Half of that runs pumps and fans.And those can all be made more efficient,and the motors that turn themcan have their system efficiency roughly doubledby integrating 35 improvements, paying back in about a year.But first we ought to be capturing bigger, cheaper savingsthat are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks.For example, pumps, the biggest use of motors,move liquid through pipes.But a standard industrial pumping loopwas redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy,not by getting better pumps,but just by replacing long, thin, crooked pipeswith fat, short, straight pipes.This is not about new technology,it's just rearranging our metal furniture.Of course, it also shrinks the pumping equipmentand its capital costs.So what do such savings meanfor the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors?Well, from the coal burned at the power plantthrough all these compounding losses,only a tenth of the fuel energyactually ends up coming out the pipe as flow.But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards,and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipesaves 10 units of fuel cost, pollutionand what Hunter Lovins calls "global weirding"back at the power plant.And of course, as you go back upstream,the components get smaller and therefore cheaper.Our team has lately found such snowballing energy savingsin more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns --everything from data centers and chip fabsto mines and refineries.Typically our retrofit designssave about 30 to 60 percent of the energyand pay back in a few years,while the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percentwith generally lower capital cost.Now needing less electricitywould ease and speedthe shift to new sources of electricity, chiefly renewables.China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost.In fact, these solar power module costshave just fallen off the bottom of the chart.And Germany now has more solar workersthan America has steel workers.Already in about 20 statesprivate installers will comeput those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money downand beat your utility bill.Such unregulated productscould ultimately add up to a virtual utilitythat bypasses your electric companyjust as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company.And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebeesand it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams.Renewables are no longer a fringe activity.For each of the past four yearshalf of the world's new generating capacityhas been renewable,mainly lately in developing countries.In 2010, renewables other than big hydro,particularly wind and solar cells,got 151 billion dollars of private investment,and they actually surpassed the total installed capacityof nuclear power in the worldby adding 60 billion watts in that one year.That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacitythat the world can now make every year --a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year.In contrast, the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacityand the orders behind those keep fadingbecause they cost too much and they have too much financial risk.In fact in this country,no new nuclear power planthas been able to raise any private construction capital,despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies.So how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants?Well efficiency and gas can displace them allat just below their operating costand, combined with renewables, can displace them more than 23 timesat less than their replacement cost.But we only need to replace them once.We're often told thoughthat only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on,because they're 24/7,whereas wind and solar power are variable,and hence supposedly unreliable.Actually no generator is 24/7. They all break.And when a big plant goes down,you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds,often for weeks or months, often without warning.That is exactly why we've designed the gridto back up failed plants with working plants.And in exactly the same way,the grid can handle wind and solar power'sforecastable variations.Hourly simulationsshow that largely or wholly renewable gridscan deliver highly reliable powerwhen they're forecasted,integrated and diversifiedby both type and location.And that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europeand for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid.That is how, for example,four German states in 2010were 43 to 52 percent wind powered.Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered,Denmark 36.And it's how all of Europe can shiftto renewable electricity.In America, our aging, dirty and insecure power systemhas to be replaced anyway by 2050.And whatever we replace it withis going to cost about the same,about six trillion dollars at present value --whether we buy more of what we've gotor new nuclear and so-called clean coal,or renewables that are more or less centralized.But those four futures at the same costdiffer profoundly in their risks,around national security,fuel, water, finance, technology,climate and health.For example, our over-centralized gridis very vulnerable to cascadingand potentially economy-shattering blackoutscaused by bad space weather or other natural disastersor a terrorist attack.But that blackout risk disappears,and all of the other risks are best managed,with distributed renewablesorganized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect,but can stand alone at need.That is, they can disconnect fractallyand then reconnect seamlessly.That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adoptingfor its own power supply.They think they need that; how about the rest of us that they're defending?We want our stuff to work too.At about the same cost as business as usual,this would maximize national security,customer choice, entrepreneurial opportunityand innovation.Together, efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supplyare starting to transform the whole electricity sector.Traditionally utilities builda lot of giant coal and nuclear plantsand a bunch of big gas plantsand maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables.And those utilities were rewarded,as they still are in 34 states,for selling you more electricity.However, especially where regulatorsare now instead rewarding cutting your bills,the investments are shifting radicallytoward efficiency, demand response, cogeneration,renewables and ways to knit them all together reliablywith less transmissionand little or no bulk electricity storage.So our energy future is not fate, but choice,and that choice is very flexible.In 1976, for example,government and industry insistedthat the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDPcould never go down.And I heretically suggested it could go down several-fold.Well that's what's actually happened so far.It's fallen by half.But with today's much better technologies,more mature delivery channels and integrative design,we can do far more and even cheaper.So to solve the energy problem,we just needed to enlarge it.And the results may at first seem incredible,but as Marshall McLuhan said,"Only puny secrets need protection.Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity."Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions,both driven by modern efficiency,and you get the really big story: reinventing fire,where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful marketscan lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050,saving 5 trillion dollars,growing the economy 2.6-fold,strengthening out national security,oh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal,reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent.Now if you like any of those outcomes,you can support reinventing firewithout needing to like all of themand without needing to agree about which of them is most important.So focusing on outcomes, not motives,can turn gridlock and conflictinto a unifying solution to America's energy challenge.This also turns out to be the best wayto cope with global challenges --climate change, nuclear proliferation,energy insecurity, energy poverty --all of which make us less safe.Now our team at RMI helps smart companiesto get unstuck and speed this journeyvia six sectoral initiatives, with some more hatching.Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too.Former oil man Maurice Strong said,"Not all the fossils are in the fuel."But as Edgar Woolard, who used to chair Dupont, reminds us,"Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problembecause," he said," they simply won't be around long-term."I've described not just a once-in-a-civilizationbusiness opportunity,but one of the most profound transitionsin the history of our species.We humans are inventing a new fire,not dug from below,but flowing from above;not scarce, but bountiful;not local, but everywhere;not transient, but permanent;not costly, but free.And but for a little transitional tail of natural gasand a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure,this new fire is flameless.Efficiently used, it really can do our workwithout working our undoing.Each of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize.And our new book "Reinventing Fire"describes how you can capture it.So with the conversation just begunat ReinventingFire.com,let me invite you eachto engage with us and with each other, with everyone around you,to help make the world richer, fairer,cooler and saferby together reinventing fire.Thank you.(Applause)



michael_norton_how_to_buy_happiness

So I want to talk today about money and happiness,which are two thingsthat a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about,either trying to earn them or trying to increase them.And a lot of us resonate with this phrase.So we see it in religions and self-help books,that money can't buy happiness.And I want to suggest today that, in fact, that's wrong.(Laughter)I'm at a business school, so that's what we do.So that's wrong, and, in fact, if you think that,you're actually just not spending it right.So that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it,maybe if you spent it differently,that might work a little bit better.And before I tell you the ways that you can spend it that will make you happier,let's think about the ways we usually spend itthat don't, in fact, make us happier.We had a little natural experiment.So CNN, a little while ago, wrote this interesting articleon what happens to people when they win the lottery.It turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing.This article's about how their lives get ruined.So what happens when people win the lotteryis, number one, they spend all the money and go into debt,and number two, all of their friends and everyone they've ever metfind them and bug them for money.And it ruins their social relationships, in fact.So they have more debt and worse friendshipsthan they had before they won the lottery.What was interesting about the articlewas people started commenting on the article, readers of the thing.And instead of talking abouthow it had made them realize that money doesn't lead to happiness,everyone instantly started saying,"You know what I would do if I won the lottery ... ?"and fantasizing about what they'd do.And here's just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about.One person wrote in, "When I win, I'm going to buy my own little mountainand have a little house on top."(Laughter)And another person wrote, "I would fill a big bathtub with moneyand get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigarand sipping a glass of champagne."This is even worse now: "Then I'd have a picture takenand dozens of glossies made.Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from mewould receive a copy of the picture and nothing else."(Laughter)And so many of the comments were exactly of this type,where people got moneyand, in fact, it made them antisocial.So I told you that it ruins people's lives and that their friends bug them.It also, money often makes us feel very selfishand we do things only for ourselves.Well maybe the reason that money doesn't make us happyis that we're always spending it on the wrong things,and in particular, that we're always spending it on ourselves.And we thought, I wonder what would happenif we made people spend more of their money on other people.So instead of being antisocial with your money,what if you were a little more prosocial with your money?And we thought, let's make people do it and see what happens.So let's have some people do what they usually doand spend money on themselves,and let's make some people give money away,and measure their happiness and see if, in fact, they get happier.So the first way that we did this.On one Vancouver morning, we went out on the campusat University of British Columbiaand we approached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?"They said, "Yes."We asked them how happy they were, and then we gave them an envelope.And one of the envelopes had things in it that said,"By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on yourself."So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on.Other people, in the morning, got a slip of paper that said,"By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on somebody else."Also inside the envelope was money.And we manipulated how much money we gave them.So some people got this slip of paper and five dollars.Some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars.We let them go about their day. They did whatever they wanted to do.We found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to.We called them up at night and asked them,"What'd you spend it on, and how happy do you feel now?"What did they spend it on?Well these are college undergrads, so a lot of what they spent it on for themselveswere things like earrings and makeup.One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece.People gave money to homeless people.Huge effect here of Starbucks.(Laughter)So if you give undergraduates five dollars, it looks like coffee to themand they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can.But some people bought a coffee for themselves, the way they usually would,but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else.So the very same purchase,just targeted toward yourselfor targeted toward somebody else.What did we find when we called them back at the end of the day?People who spent money on other people got happier.People who spent money on themselves, nothing happened.It didn't make them less happy, it just didn't do much for them.And the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn't matter that much.So people thought that 20 dollars would be way better than five dollars.In fact, it doesn't matter how much money you spent.What really matters is that you spent it on somebody elserather than on yourself.We see this again and againwhen we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves.Of course, these are undergraduates in Canada --not the world's most representative population.They're also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things.We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the worldor just among wealthy countries.So we went, in fact, to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment.So imagine, instead of just people in Canada,we said, "Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people.Describe it. How happy did it make you?"Or in Uganda, "Name the last time you spent moneyon yourself or other people and describe that."And then we asked them how happy they are again.And what we see is sort of amazingbecause there's human universals on what you do with your moneyand then real cultural differences on what you do as well.So for example,one guy from Uganda says this.He said, "I called a girl I wished to love."They basically went out on a date,and he says at the end that he didn't "achieve" her up till now.Here's a guy from Canada.Very similar thing."I took my girlfriend out for dinner.We went to a movie, we left early,and then went back to her room for ... " only cake -- just a piece of cake.Human universal -- so you spend money on other people,you're being nice to them.Maybe you have something in mind, maybe not.But then we see extraordinary differences.So look at these two.This is a woman from Canada.We say, "Name a time you spent money on somebody else."She says, "I bought a present for my mom.I drove to the mall in my car, bought a present, gave it to my mom."Perfectly nice thing to do.It's good to get gifts for people that you know.Compare that to this woman from Uganda."I was walking and met a long-time friendwhose son was sick with malaria.They had no money, they went to a clinic and I gave her this money."This isn't $10,000, it's the local currency.So it's a very small amount of money, in fact.But enormously different motivations here.This is a real medical need,literally a life-saving donation.Above, it's just kind of, I bought a gift for my mother.What we see again thoughis that the specific way that you spend on other peopleisn't nearly as importantas the fact that you spend on other peoplein order to make yourself happy,which is really quite important.So you don't have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy.You can do small, trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this.These are only two countries.We also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we couldto see what the relationship is between money and happiness.We got data from the Gallup Organization,which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately.They ask people, "Did you donate money to charity recently?"and they ask them, "How happy are you with your life in general?"And we can see what the relationship is between those two things.Are they positively correlated? Giving money makes you happy.Or are they negatively correlated?On this map, green will mean they're positively correlatedand red means they're negatively correlated.And you can see, the world is crazily green.So in almost every country in the worldwhere we have this data,people who give money to charity are happier peoplethat people who don't give money to charity.I know you're all looking at that red country in the middle.I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is,but in fact, it's Central African Republic.You can make up stories. Maybe it's different there for some reason or another.Just below that to the right is Rwanda though,which is amazingly green.So almost everywhere we lookwe see that giving money away makes you happierthan keeping it for yourself.What about your work life, which is where we spend all the rest of our timewhen we're not with the people we know.We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing.So these are sales teams in Belgium.They work in teams; they go out and sell to doctorsand try to get them to buy drugs.So we can look and see how well they sell thingsas a function of being a member of a team.Some teams, we give people on the team some money for themselvesand say, "Spend it however you want on yourself,"just like we did with the undergrads in Canada.But other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro.Spend it on one of your teammates this week.Buy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them.And then we can see, well now we've got teams that spend on themselvesand we've got these prosocial teamswho we give money to make the team a little bit better.The reason I have a ridiculous pinata thereis one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata,and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that.A very silly, trivial thing to do,but think of the difference on a team that didn't do that at all,that got 15 euro, put it in their pocket,maybe bought themselves a coffee,or teams that had this prosocial experiencewhere they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity.What we see is that, in fact, the teams that are prosocial sell more stuffthan the teams that only got money for themselves.And one way to think about itis for every 15 euro you give people for themselves,they put it in their pocket, they don't do anything different than they did before.You don't get any money from that.You actually lose money because it doesn't motivate them to perform any better.But when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates,they do so much better on their teamsthat you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money.And I realize that you're probably thinking to yourselves,this is all fine,but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policyand I can't imagine it would work there.And basically that if he doesn't show me that it works here,I don't believe anything he said.And I know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams.(Laughter)This was a huge criticism that we gotto say, if you can't show it with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.So we went out and found these dodgeball teamsand infiltrated them.And we did the exact same thing as before.So some teams, we give people on the team money, they spend it on themselves.Other teams, we give them moneyto spend on their dodgeball teammates.The teams that spend money on themselvesare just the same winning percentages as they were before.The teams that we give the money to spend on each other,they become different teamsand, in fact, they dominate the league by the time they're done.Across all of these different contexts --your personal life, you work life,even silly things like intramural sports --we see spending on other people has a bigger return for youthan spending on yourself.And so I'll just say, I think if you think money can't buy happinessyou're not spending it right.The implication is not you should buy this product instead of that productand that's the way to make yourself happier.It's in fact, that you should stop thinkingabout which product to buy for yourselfand try giving some of it to other people instead.And we luckily have an opportunity for you.DonorsChoose.org is a non-profitfor mainly public school teachers in low-income schools.They post projects,so they say, "I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don't have the books,"or "I want a microscope to teach my students scienceand we don't have a microscope."You and I can go on and buy it for them.The teacher writes you a thank you note. The kids write you a thank you note.Sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope.It's an extraordinary thing.Go to the website and start yourself on the processof thinking, again, less about "How can I spend money on myself?"and more about "If I've got five dollars or 15 dollars,what can I do to benefit other people?"Because ultimately when you do that, you'll find that you'll benefit yourself much more.Thank you.(Applause)



drew_curtis_how_i_beat_a_patent_troll
1037150

Last January, my company, Fark.com, was suedalong with Yahoo, MSN, Reddit,AOL, TechCrunch and othersby a company called Gooseberry Natural Resources.Gooseberry owned a patentfor the creation and distributionof news releases via email.(Laughter)Now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented,but it does happen all the time.Take something already being doneand patent it for an emerging technology --like phone calls on the internetor video listings for TV showsor radio but for cellphones,and so on.The problem with these patentsis that the mechanisms are obscureand the patent system is dysfunctional,and as a result, most of these lawsuits end in settlements.And because these settlements are under a non-disclosure agreement,no one knows what the terms were.And as a result, the patent troll can claimthat they won the case.In the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources,this patent on emailing news releaseshad sort of a fatal flawas it pertained to myself,and that was that in the mainstream media worldthere is only one definition for news release,and it turns out that is press release --as in P.R.Now my company, Fark,deals with news, ostensibly,and as a resultwe were not in violation of this patent.So case closed, right?Wrong.One of the major problems with patent law is that,in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll,the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patentis actually on the defendant,which means you have to provethat you do not infringe on the patent they're suing you on.And this can take quite a while.You need to know that the average patent troll defensecosts two million dollarsand takes 18 months when you win.That is your best case outcomewhen you get sued by a patent troll.Now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companiesin order to defend against this lawsuit,but one-by-one they settled out of the case,even though -- and this is important --none of these companiesinfringed on this patent -- not a one of them.And they started settling out.The reason they settled outis because it's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit --clearly, two million dollars cheaper in some cases,and much worse if you actually lose.It would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company,especially a small eight-man shop like my company.Six months into the lawsuit,we finally reached the discovery phase.And in discovery phase,we asked the patent troll to please providescreenshots of Farkwhere the infringement of their patentwas actually occurring.Now perhaps it's because no such screenshots actually existed,but suddenly Gooseberry wanted to settle.Their attorney:"Ah, yes. My company's having a reorganization on our end."Never mind the factthat the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A.with no employees."And we'd like to go ahead and close this out.So would you mind giving us your best and final offer?"My response:"How about nothing?!"(Applause)We didn't have high hopes for that outcome.(Laughter)But they settled.No counter offer.Now, as mentioned before,one of the reasons I can talk to you about thisis because there's no non-disclosure agreement on this case.Now how did that happen?Well during the settlement process, when we received our copy, I struck it.My attorney said, "Nah, no chance of that working."It came back signed.Now why? You can call them.They're not under NDA either.Now what did I learn from this case? Well, three things.First of all, if you can,don't fight the patent, fight the infringement.Patents are very difficult to overturn.Infringement is a lot easier to disprove.Secondly, make it clear from the beginningthat either you have no money at allor that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the trollthan actually giving them the money.Now the reason this worksis because patent trollsare paid a percentage of what they're able to recover in settlements.If it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money,they become less interested in pursuing the case.Finally, make sure that you can tell themthat you will make this processas annoying and as painfuland as difficult as possible for them.Now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on peopleto get their way.It turns out, because they're paid on contingency,it works really, really well in reverse.Don't forget that.So what does all this mean?Well to sum up,it boils down to one thing:Don't negotiate with terrorists.(Applause)Patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economythan any domestic or foreignterrorist organization in historyevery year.And what do they do with that money?They plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits.Now this is the point in the Talkwhere I'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system.And the problem with thatis that there are two very large industry groupsthat have different outcomes in mindfor the patent system.The health care industrywould like stronger protections for inventors.The hi-tech industrywould like stronger protections for producers.And these goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposed, but they are at odds.And as a result, patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between.So unfortunately I'm not smart enoughto have a solution for the patent troll problem.However, I did have this idea,and it was kind of good.And I thought, "I should patent this."(Laughter)Behold, patent infringement via mobile device --defined as a computer which is not stationary.My solution: award me this patentand I will troll them out of existence.Thank you.(Applause)



rob_reid_the_8_billion_ipod

The recent debate over copyright lawslike SOPA in the United Statesand the ACTA agreement in Europehas been very emotional.And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoningcould really bring a great deal to the debate.I'd therefore like to proposethat we employ, we enlist,the cutting edge field of copyright mathwhenever we approach this subject.For instance, just recentlythe Motion Picture Association revealedthat our economy loses 58 billion dollars a yearto copyright theft.Now rather than just argue about this number,a copyright mathematician will analyze itand he'll soon discover that this moneycould stretch from this auditoriumall the way across Ocean Boulevardto the Westin, and then to Mars ...(Laughter)... if we use pennies.Now this is obviously a powerful,some might say dangerously powerful, insight.But it's also a morally important one.Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail valueof some pirated movies that we're talking about,but this is actual economic losses.This is the equivalentto the entire American corn crop failingalong with all of our fruit crops,as well as wheat, tobacco,rice, sorghum --whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum.But identifying the actual losses to the economyis almost impossible to dounless we use copyright math.Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a yearsince Napster first came on the scene.So that's a chunk of what we're looking for.But total movie revenuesacross theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up.And TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up.Other content markets like book publishing and radioare also up.So this small missing chunk hereis puzzling.(Laughter)(Applause)Since the big content marketshave grown in line with historic norms,it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented,but copyright math tells usit must therefore be foregone growthin a market that has no historic norms --one that didn't exist in the 90's.What we're looking at hereis the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.(Laughter)50 billion dollars of it a year,which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone,that could stretch from hereto Neanderthal times.(Laughter)It's true.(Applause)I have Excel.(Laughter)The movie folks also tell usthat our economy losesover 370,000 jobs to content theft,which is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98,the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicatedthat the motion picture and video industrieswere employing 270,000 people.Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people.And so the job losses that came with the Internetand all that content theft,have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries.And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statisticsthat copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day.And some people think that string theory is tough.(Laughter)Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit.It's the precise amount of harmthat comes to media companieswhenever a single copyrighted song or moviegets pirated.Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematicallyback when they last sat down to improve copyright damagesand made this law.Some people think this number's a little bit large,but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby expertsare merely surprisedthat it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year.Now when this law first passed,the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs.And it was a big Christmas hit.Because what little hoodlum wouldn't wanta million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket.(Laughter)(Applause)These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs,which is to say eight billion dollars-worthof stolen media.(Applause)Or about 75,000 jobs.(Laughter)(Applause)Now you might find copyright math strange,but that's because it's a fieldthat's best left to experts.So that's it for now.I hope you'll join me next timewhen I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiryinto the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy.Thank you very much.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)

I want to discuss with you this afternoon(Laughter)I'm an economist.I do dismal.You're going to fail, too.(Laughter)(Laughter)Canadian group, undoubtedly.(Laughter)There are great jobs and great careers,and then there are the high-workload,and practically nothing in-between.and why you're going to fail.the greatest fascination in your life,"Steven J.'s Stanford commencement address,You're too lazy to do it. It's too hard.They are excuses, ladies and gentlemen.if you want to have a great career.(Sigh)just a matter of luck.If not, I'll have a good career."Then, your other excuse is,but they are geniuses.They are Steven J.I'm not a genius.When I was five, I thought I was a genius,(Laughter)Now, you see, if this was 1950,being completely competent --that would have given you a great career.But guess what?"I am totally, completely competent,"And then, of course, another excuse:well, after all, I'm not weird.are somewhat obsessive.A little strange.Hmm? Hmm? Okay?I am normal.don't have passion."(Laughter)"Ah, but I still want a great career.I'm not prepared to pursue my passion,so I know what I'm going to do,because I have a solution.I have a strategy.I'd have a good career.if you work really, really, really hard,you'll have a great career.Hmm. Not.You know what? Here's a little secret:You know what? You'll succeed.The world will give you the opportunityBut, are you so surewhen all the evidence is to the contrary?never mind the excuses.You're trying to find your passion --(Sigh)and you're so happy.You found something you're interested in."I have an interest! I have an interest!"You tell me.And what are you trying to tell me?""Well, I have an interest."I say, "Do you have passion?""I have an interest," you say."Your interest is compared to what?""Well, I'm interested in this.""I'm not interested in them.""You've looked at them all, have you?""No. Not exactly."Passion is your greatest love.Passion is the thing"Marry me! You're interesting."(Laughter)Won't happen.Won't happen, and you will die alone.(Laughter)What you want,what you want, what you want,is passion.It is beyond interest.one of them might grab you,and that's what passion is.I have a friend, proposed to his sweetie.He was an economically rational person.He said to his sweetie, "Let us marry.Let us merge our interests."(Laughter)Yes, he did.Ingrid, Gertrude, Gretel --I was on a German exchange program then.I love you more than --"All right.She left the roomhe concluded he'd had a narrow escapefrom marrying an irrational person.it was perhaps not necessary(Laughter)But the point stands.or are you afraid of the word "destiny"?Does the word "destiny" scare you?That's what we're talking about.and inscribed on that tombstonewho invented Velcro."But what that tombstone should have said,in an alternative lifetime,(Laughter)Velcro, indeed!(Laughter)One was a great career.One was a missed opportunity.But then, there are some of you who,you will find your passion.And you'll still fail.You're going to fail, because --because you're not going to do it,any excuse to fail to take action,and this excuse, I've heard so many times:"Yes, I would pursue a great career,but, I value human relationships --(Laughter)more than accomplishment.I want to be a great friend.I want to be a great spouse.I want to be a great parent,and I will not sacrifice themon the altar of great accomplishment."(Laughter)What do you want me to say?"Really, I swear I don't kick children."(Laughter)You're a hero no matter what.And I, by suggesting ever so delicatelyI don't hate children. I don't kick them.(Laughter)and to get out.He mumbled something about his mother,(Laughter)What a wimp.(Laughter)Do you really think it's appropriateYou know what will happen someday,you ideal parent, you?The kid will come to you someday and say,"I know what I want to be.I know what I'm going to do with my life."You are so happy.because your kid's good in math,Says your kid,"I have decided I want to be a magician.(Laughter)And what do you say?You say, you say,"That's risky, kid.You're so good at math, why don't you --"The kid interrupts you and says,And what are you going to say?You know what you're going to say?"Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but --But --"Or are you going to tell him this:"I had a dream once, kid.But then, you were born."(Laughter)(Applause)Do you really want to use your family,and see your jailers?when he or she said, "I have a dream."You could have said --looked the kid in the face and said,"Go for it, kid!Just like I did."But you won't be able to say that,because you didn't.So you can't.(Laughter)And so the sins of the parentsare visited on the poor children.You know why.In your heart of hearts, you know why,and I'm being deadly serious.It is because you are --you know what you are.You're afraid to pursue your passion.You're afraid to look ridiculous.You're afraid to try.You're afraid you may fail.How can you be one without the other?But you're afraid.Unless --"unless."But the "unless" word is also attachedto that other, most terrifying phrase,"If only I had ...""If only I had ..."it will hurt a lot.So, those are the many reasonswhy you are going to failto have a great career.Unless --Unless.Thank you.(Applause)



susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts
15490182

When I was nine years old,And this might sound antisocial to you,inside your own mind.And I had this idea(Laughter)(Laughter)And on the very first day,our counselor gathered us all togetherAnd it went like this:"R-O-W-D-I-E,that's the way we spell rowdie.Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."(Laughter)Yeah.why we were supposed to be so rowdy,(Laughter)I did my best.the coolest girl in the bunk came up to meof R-O-W-D-I-E.And then the second time I tried it,And so I put my books away,back in their suitcase,and I put them under my bed,And I felt kind of guilty about this.I felt as if the books needed me somehow,all the times that I got the messagewas not necessarily the right way to go,But for years I denied this intuition,And I was always going off to crowded barsNow this is what many introverts do,and it's our loss for sure,but it is also our colleagues' lossand our communities' loss.a third to a half.So even if you're an extrovert yourself,I'm talking about your coworkersand your spouses and your childrenall of them subject to this biasNow, to see the bias clearly,It's different from being shy.Shyness is about fear of social judgment.Introversion is more about,how do you respond to stimulation,including social stimulation.but a lot of the time.So the key then to maximizing our talentsis for us all to put ourselvesBut now here's where the bias comes in.Our most important institutions,our schools and our workplaces,they are designed mostly for extrovertsthat I call the new groupthink,comes from a very oddly gregarious place.We sat in rows of desks like this,those kids are seen as outliers oftenor, worse, as problem cases.And the vast majority of teachersas opposed to an introvert,and are more knowledgeable,according to research.(Laughter)Now, most of us work in open plan offices,without walls,And when it comes to leadership,much less likely to take outsize risks --has found that introverted leadersget so excited about thingsI'll give you some examples.Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi --And they all took the spotlight,not because they enjoyed directing othersthat I actually love extroverts.including my beloved husband.along the introvert/extrovert spectrum.or a pure extrovert.if he existed at all.and we call these people ambiverts.This is especially importantwhat they findand advancing ideas,And this is because solitudeSo Darwin,he took long walks alone in the woodsTheodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,in a lonely bell tower office that he hadwhere he was working at the time.when he was growing up.Now, of course,to start Apple Computer --but it does mean that solitude mattersyou will find seekers --Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad --So, no wilderness, no revelations.This is no surprise, though,like who you're attracted to,And groups famously follow the opinionseven though there's zero correlationI mean zero.So --(Laughter)but you might not.generate their own ideasand then come together as a teamand take it from there.Now if all this is true,then why are we getting it so wrong?Western societies,and in particular the U.S.,But in America's early days,they all had titles with things likeRalph Waldo Emerson called himBut then we hit the 20th century,and we entered a new cultureto a world of big business.So, quite understandably,and they start to have namesSo that's the world we're living in today.That's our cultural inheritance.also teach us love and trust.And the problems that we are facing todayin fields like science and in economicsare so vast and so complexto solve them working together.the more likely that they areGuess what?Books.I have a suitcase full of books.Here's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."Here's a novel by Milan Kundera.But these are not exactly my books.I brought these books with meMy grandfather was a rabbiand he was a widowerhad yielded its original functionJust like the rest of my family,But he also loved his congregation,and he would weaveBut here's the thing about my grandfather.Underneath this ceremonial role,he had trouble making eye contactAnd even away from the podium,when you called him to say hello,But when he died at the age of 94,in my own way.and it took me about seven years to write.because I was reading, I was writing,I was thinking, I was researching.It was my versiontalking about introversion.(Laughter)And that's a lot harder for me,this is not my natural milieu.every chance I could get.(Laughter)And that actually helped a lot.But I'll tell you, what helps even moreI mean, we are.And so I am going to leave you nowNumber one:Stop the madness for constant group work.Just stop it.(Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)because I deeply believe our officesThat is great.and much more autonomy at work.School, same thing.They need to work on their ownOkay, number two: Go to the wilderness.Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.I'm not sayingand never talk to each other again,Number three:and why you put it there.So extroverts,But introverts, you being you,what's inside your own suitcase.And that's okay.But occasionally, just occasionally,and the courage to speak softly.Thank you very much.(Applause)Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)

we were playing on top of a bunk bed.and I wanted to play war.So we were up on top of our bunk beds.And on one side of the bunk bed,ready for a cavalry charge.let me tell you the true story --(Laughter)and landed with this crash on the floor.to see what had befallen my fallen sisteron all fours on the ground.with making sure that my sister and Ijust one week before --(Laughter)(Laughter ends)(Laughter)she didn't even see it coming --And I saw my sister's face,So I did the only thingNo human lands on all fours like that.Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn."(Laughter)Now, that was cheating,but Amy the special unicorn.at no point in the past.And the latter won.Instead of crying or ceasing our play,instead of waking my parents,with all the negative consequences for me,a smile spread across her facewith all the grace of a baby unicorn --(Laughter)with one broken leg.What we stumbled acrosswe had no idea at the time --which is the reason I'm here todayWhen I started talking about this researchThis graph looks boring,What we found is --(Laughter)because there's a trend there,and that means that I can get published,which is all that really matters.there's one weirdo in the room --I know who you are, I saw you earlier --that's no problem.(Laughter)So one of the first things we teach peopleBut if I'm interested in your potential,If I asked a question like,scientists change the answer toIf you fall below the average,then psychologists get thrilled,or hopefully both.so you keep coming back.But normal is merely average.we will remain merely average.and say, why?Why are some of you high above the curvecreativity, energy levels,Because maybe we can glean information,The reason this graph is important to mein fact it's negative.And very quickly, my brain starts to thinkDuring the first year of medical training,suddenly you realize you have all of them.(Laughter)Bobo married Amy the unicorn.Bobo called me on the phone --(Laughter)from Yale Medical School,and Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy."(Laughter)But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo(Laughter)I applied to Harvard on a dare.that they'd be excited to be there.when I graduated after my four yearsHarvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy.(Laughter)And in my research and my teaching,nor on their philosophy or physics,but on the competition, the workload,the hassles, stresses, complaints.I know some of you know this.When they'd visit, they'd look around,And when they see this,Embedded within that questionBecause what that question assumesAnd if we change it,75 percent of job successesand they said, "We already know that.will speak about adolescent depression.Wednesday night is eating disorders.Thursday night is illicit drug use.(Laughter)(Laughter)(Applause)Silence on the phone.but not talked about the positive."The absence of disease is not health.Here's how we get to health:If I work harder, I'll be more successful.the way that we motivate our behavior.Every time your brain has a success,then we'll be happier.But our brains work in the opposite order.than at negative, neutral or stressed.You're 37% better at sales.at coming up with the correct diagnosisWhich means we can reverse the formula.We need to be able to reverse this formulahas two functions.Not only does it make you happier,to be able to become more positive.we can actually rewire your brain,We've done these things in research nowin every company that I've worked with,And at the end of that,their brain starts to retain a patternallows your brain to relive it.We find that meditation allows your brainby trying to do multiple tasks at onceto write one positive emailAnd by doing these activitiesbut a real revolution.Thank you very much.(Applause)

It is actually a reality todaythat you can download products from the Web --product data, I should say, from the Web --perhaps tweak it and personalize itto your own preference or your own taste,and have that information sentto a desktop machinethat will fabricate it for you on the spot.We can actually build for you,very rapidly,a physical object.And the reason we can do thisis through an emerging technologycalled additive manufacturing,or 3D printing.This is a 3D printer.They have been aroundfor almost 30 years now,which is quite amazing to think of,but they're only just startingto filter into the public arena.And typically, you would take data,like the data of a pen here,which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3D,and we would pass that data with materialinto a machine.And a process that would happen in the machinewould mean layer by layer that product would be built.And we can take out the physical product,and ready to use,or to, perhaps, assemble into something else.But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years,why don't we know about them?Because typically they've been too inefficient,inaccessible,they've not been fast enough,they've been quite expensive.But today,it is becoming a realitythat they are now becoming successful.Many barriers are breaking down.That means that you guyswill soon be able to access one of these machines,if not this minute.And it will change and disruptthe landscape of manufacturing,and most certainly our lives, our businessesand the lives of our children.So how does it work?It typically reads CAD data,which is a product design datacreated on professional product design programs.And here you can see an engineer --it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer --create a product in 3D.And this data gets sent to a machinethat slices the datainto two-dimensional representations of that productall the way through --almost like slicing it like salami.And that data, layer by layer, gets passed through the machine,starting at the base of the productand depositing material, layer upon layer,infusing the new layer of materials to the old layerin an additive process.And this material that's depositedeither starts as a liquid formor a material powder form.And the bonding process can happenby either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.In this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.It's actually using a laserto fuse the new layer of material to the old layer.And over time --quite rapidly actually, in a number of hours --we can build a physical product,ready to take out of the machine and use.And this is quite an extraordinary idea,but it is reality today.So all these products that you can see on the screenwere made in the same way.They were all 3D printed.And you can see,they're ranging from shoes,rings that were made out of stainless steal,phone covers out of plastic,all the way through to spinal implants, for example,that were created out of medical-grade titanium,and engine parts.But what you'll notice about all of these productsis they're very, very intricate.The design is quite extraordinary.Because we're taking this data in 3D form,slicing it up before it gets past the machine,we can actually create structuresthat are more intricatethan any other manufacturing technology --or, in fact, are impossible to build in any other way.And you can create parts with moving components,hinges, parts within parts.So in some cases, we can abolish totallythe need for manual labor.It sounds great.It is great.We can have 3D printers todaythat build structures like these.This is almost three meters high.And this was builtby depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layerin layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness --slowly growing this structure.This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro.And you can actually walk into it.And on the other end of the spectrum,this is a microstructure.It's created depositing layersof about four microns.So really the resolution is quite incredible.The detail that you can get todayis quite amazing.So who's using it?Typically, because we can create products very rapidly,it's been used by product designers,or anyone who wanted to prototype a productand very quickly create or reiterate a design.And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as wellis that you can create bespoke products en masse.There's very little economies of scale.So you can now create one-offs very easily.Architects, for example,they want to create prototypes of buildings.Again you can see,this is a building of the Free University in Berlinand it was designed by Foster and Partners.Again, not buildable in any other way.And very hard to even create this by hand.Now this is an engine component.It was developed by a company called Within Technologiesand 3T RPD.It's very, very, very detailedinside with the design.Now 3D printingcan break away barriers in designwhich challenge the constraintsof mass production.If we slice into this product which is actually sitting here,you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it,which means it's a more efficient product.You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniqueseven if you tried to do it manually.It's more efficientbecause we can now create all these cavities within the objectthat cool fluid.And it's used by aerospaceand automotive.It's a lighter partand it uses less material waste.So it's overall performance and efficiencyjust exceeds standard mass produced products.And then taking this ideaof creating a very detailed structure,we can apply it to honeycomb structuresand use them within implants.Typically an implantis more effective within the bodyif it's more porous,because our body tissue will grow into it.There's a lower chance of rejection.But it's very hard to create that in standard ways.With 3D printing,we're seeing todaythat we can create much better implants.And in fact, because we can createbespoke products en masse, one-offs,we can create implantsthat are specific to individuals.So as you can see,this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic.And we're starting to see it being usedfor final end products.And in fact, as the detail is improving,the quality is improving,the price of the machines are fallingand they're becoming quicker.They're also now small enoughto sit on a desktop.You can buy a machine today for about $300that you can create yourself,which is quite incredible.But then it begs the question,why don't we all have one in our home?Because, simply, most of us here todaydon't know how to create the datathat a 3D printer reads.If I gave you a 3D printer,you wouldn't know how to direct itto make what you want it to.But there are more and moretechnologies, software and processes todaythat are breaking down those barriers.I believe we're at a tipping pointwhere this is now somethingthat we can't avoid.This technologyis really going to disruptthe landscape of manufacturingand, I believe, cause a revolutionin manufacturing.So today,you can download products from the Web --anything you would have on your desktop,like pens, whistles, lemon squeezers.You can use software like Google SketchUpto create products from scratchvery easily.3D printing can be also usedto download spare parts from the Web.So imagine you have, say,a Hoover in your homeand it has broken down. You need a spare part,but you realize that Hoover's been discontinued.Can you imagine going online --this is a reality --and finding that spare partfrom a database of geometriesof that discontinued productand downloading that information, that data,and having the product made for you at home,ready to use, on your demand?And in fact, because we can create spare partswith things the machinesare quite literally making themselves.You're having machines fabricate themselves.These are parts of a RepRap machine,which is a kind of desktop printer.But what interests my company the mostis the fact that you can createindividual unique products en masse.There's no need to do a runof thousands of millionsor send that product to be injection molded in China.You can just make it physically on the spot.Which meansthat we can now present to the publicthe next generation of customization.This is something that is now possible today,that you can direct personallyhow you want your products to look.We're all familiar with the ideaof customization or personalization.Brands like Nike are doing it.It's all over the Web.In fact, every major household nameis allowing youto interact with their productson a daily basis --all the way from Smart Carsto Pradato Ray Ban, for example.But this is not really mass customization;it's known as variant production,variations of the same product.What you could do is really influence your product nowand shape-manipulate your product.I'm not sure about you guys,but I've had experienceswhen I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wantedand I've searched everywhere for that perfect lampthat I know where I want to sit in my houseand I just can't find the right thing,or that perfect piece of jewelryas a gift or for myself.Imagine that you can nowengage with a brandand interact,so that you can pass your personal attributesto the products that you're about to buy.You can todaydownload a product with software like this,view the product in 3D.This is the sort of 3D datathat a machine will read.This is a lamp.And you can start iterating the design.You can direct what color that product will be,perhaps what material.And also, you can engage in shape manipulation of that product,but within boundaries that are safe.Because obviously the public are not professional product designers.The piece of software will keep an individualwithin the bounds of the possible.And when somebody is ready to purchase the productin their personalized design,they click "Enter" and this data gets convertedinto the data that a 3D printer readsand gets passed to a 3D printer,perhaps on someone's desktop.But I don't think that that's immediate.I don't think that will happen soon.What's more likely, and we're seeing it today,is that data gets sentto a local manufacturing center.This means lower carbon footprint.We're now, instead of shipping a product across the world,we're sending data across the Internet.Here's the product being built.You can see, this came out of the machine in one pieceand the electronics were inserted later.It's this lamp, as you can see here.So as long as you have the data,you can create the part on demand.And you don't necessarily need to use thisfor just aesthetic customization,you can use it for functional customization,scanning parts of the bodyand creating things that are made to fit.So we can run this through to something like prosthetics,which is highly specialized to an individual's handicap.Or we can create very specific prostheticsfor that individual.Scanning teeth today,you can have your teeth scannedand dental coatings made in this way to fit you.While you wait at the dentist,a machine will quietly be creating this for youready to insert in the teeth.And the idea of now creating implants,scanning data, an MRI scan of somebodycan now be converted into 3D dataand we can create very specific implants for them.And applying thisto the idea of building up what's in our bodies.You know, this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree.It's very intricate.You couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way.But with MRI data,we can just build the product,as you can see, very intricately.Using this process,pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today.So one of the pioneers, for example, is Dr. Anthony Atala,and he has been workingon layering cells to create body parts --bladders, valves, kidneys.Now this is not something that's ready for the public,but it is in working progress.So just to finalize, we're all individual.We all have different preferences, different needs.We like different things.We're all different sizes and our companies the same.Businesses want different things.Without a doubt in my mind,I believe that this technologyis going to cause a manufacturing revolutionand will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it.Thank you.(Applause)

Do you know how many choices you makein a typical day?Do you know how many choices you makein typical week?I recently did a surveywith over 2,000 Americans,and the average number of choicesthat the typical American reports makingis about 70 in a typical day.There was also recently a study done with CEOsin which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.And these scientists simply documented all the various tasksthat these CEOs engaged inand how much time they spent engagingin making decisions related to these tasks.And they found that the average CEOengaged in about 139 tasks in a week.Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.50 percent of their decisionswere made in nine minutes or less.Only about 12 percent of the decisionsdid they make an hour or more of their time.Think about your own choices.Do you know how many choicesmake it into your nine minute categoryversus your one hour category?How well do you think you're doingat managing those choices?Today I want to talkabout one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,which is the choice overload problem.I want to talk about the problemand some potential solutions.Now as I talk about this problem,I'm going to have some questions for youand I'm going to want to know your answers.So when I ask you a question,since I'm blind,only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.(Laughter)Otherwise, when I ask you a question,and if your answer is yes,I'd like you to clap your hands.So for my first question for you today:Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?(Applause)Thank you.So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;at least at that time it was truly upscale.It was a store called Draeger's.Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegarsand over 500 different kindsof fruits and vegetablesand more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.I used to love going to this store,but on one occasion I asked myself,well how come you never buy anything?Here's their olive oil aisle.They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,including those that were in a locked casethat came from thousand-year-old olive trees.So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,and I asked the manager,"Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"And he pointed to the busloads of touriststhat would show up everyday,with cameras ready usually.We decided to do a little experiment,and we picked jam for our experiment.Here's their jam aisle.They had 348 different kinds of jam.We set up a little tasting boothright near the entrance of the store.We there put out six different flavors of jamor 24 different flavors of jam,and we looked at two things:First, in which casewere people more likely to stop, sample some jam?More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,than when there were six,about 40 percent.The next thing we looked atis in which case were people more likelyto buy a jar of jam.Now we see the opposite effect.Of the people who stopped when there were 24,only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.Of the people who stopped when there were six,well now we saw that 30 percent of themactually bought a jar of jam.Now if you do the math,people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jamif they encountered sixthan if they encountered 24.Now choosing not to buy a jar of jamis probably good for us --at least it's good for our waistlines --but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects useven in very consequential decisions.We choose not to choose,even when it goes against our best self-interests.So now for the topic of today: financial savings.Now I'm going to describe to you a study I didwith Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jangwhere we looked at the retirement savings decisionsof nearly a million Americansfrom about 650 plansall in the U.S.And what we looked atwas whether the number of fund offeringsavailable in a retirement savings plan,the 401(k) plan,does that affect people's likelihoodto save more for tomorrow.And what we foundwas that indeed there was a correlation.So in these plans, we had about 657 plansthat ranged from offering peopleanywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.And what we found was that,the more funds offered,indeed, there was less participation rate.So if you look at the extremes,those plans that offered you two funds,participation rates were around in the mid-70s --still not as high as we want it to be.In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,participation rates have now droppedto about the 60th percentile.Now it turns outthat even if you do choose to participatewhen there are more choices present,even then, it has negative consequences.So for those people who did choose to participate,the more choices available,the more likely people wereto completely avoid stocks or equity funds.The more choices available,the more likely they wereto put all their money in pure money market accounts.Now neither of these extreme decisionsare the kinds of decisionsthat any of us would recommend for peoplewhen you're considering their future financial well-being.Well, over the past decade,we have observed three main negative consequencesto offering people more and more choices.They're more likely to delay choosing --procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.They're more likely to make worse choices --worse financial choices, medical choices.They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,even when they do objectively better.The main reason for thisis because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant wallsof mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrastingand actually picking from that stunning display.So what I want to propose to you todayare four simple techniques --techniques that we have tested in one way or anotherin different research venues --that you can easily applyin your businesses.The first: Cut.You've heard it said before,but it's never been more true than today,that less is more.People are always upset when I say, "Cut."They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.But in fact, what we're seeing more and moreis that if you are willing to cut,get rid of those extraneous redundant options,well there's an increase in sales,there's a lowering of costs,there is an improvement of the choosing experience.When Proctor &amp; Gamblewent from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15,they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.When the Golden Cat Corporationgot rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,they saw an increase in profitsby 87 percent --a function of both increase in salesand lowering of costs.You know, the average grocery store todayoffers you 45,000 products.The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.But the ninth largest retailer,the ninth biggest retailer in the world todayis Aldi,and it offers you only 1,400 products --one kind of canned tomato sauce.Now in the financial savings world,I think one of the best examples that has recently come outon how to best manage the choice offeringshas actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,which was the program that they have at Harvard.Every single Harvard employeeis now automatically enrolledin a lifecycle fund.For those people who actually want to choose,they're given 20 funds,not 300 or more funds.You know, often, people say,"I don't know how to cut.They're all important choices."And the first thing I do is I ask the employees,"Tell me how these choices are different from one another.And if your employees can't tell them apart,neither can your consumers."Now before we started our session this afternoon,I had a chat with Gary.And Gary said that he would be willingto offer people in this audiencean all-expenses-paid free vacationto the most beautiful road in the world.Here's a description of the road.And I'd like you to read it.And now I'll give you a few seconds to read itand then I want you to clap your handsif you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.(Light clapping)Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.Is that all?All right, let me show you some more about this.(Laughter)You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.(Honk)Now who's ready to go on this trip.(Applause)(Laughter)I think I might have actually heard more hands.All right.Now in fact,you had objectively more informationthe first time around than the second time around,but I would venture to guessthat you felt that it was more real the second time around.Because the pictures made it feelmore real to you.Which brings me to the second techniquefor handling the choice overload problem,which is concretization.That in order for people to understandthe differences between the choices,they have to be able to understandthe consequences associated with each choice,and that the consequences need to be feltin a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent morewhen they use an ATM card or a credit cardas opposed to cash?Because it doesn't feel like real money.And it turns outthat making it feel more concretecan actually be a very positive toolto use in getting people to save more.So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartziand Alessandro Previtero,we did a study with people at ING --employees that are all working at ING --and now these people were all in a sessionwhere they're doing enrollment for their 401(k) plan.And during that session,we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,but we added one little thing.The one little thing we addedwas we asked peopleto just think about all the positive things that would happen in your lifeif you saved more.By doing that simple thing,there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percentand there was an increase in the amount of people willing to saveor the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings accountby four percent.The third technique: Categorization.We can handle more categoriesthan we can handle choices.So for example,here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.It turns out that in Wegmans grocery storesup and down the northeast corridor,the magazine aisles range anywherefrom 331 different kinds of magazinesall the way up to 664.But you know what?If I show you 600 magazinesand I divide them up into 10 categories,versus I show you 400 magazinesand divide them up into 20 categories,you believe that I have given youmore choice and a better choosing experienceif I gave you the 400than if I gave you the 600.Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.Here are two different jewelry displays.One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing."If you think the display on the left is Swingand the display on the right is Jazz,clap your hands.(Light Clapping)Okay, there's some.If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,clap your hands.Okay, a bit more.Now it turns out you're right.The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,but you know what?This is a highly useless categorization scheme.(Laughter)The categories need to say somethingto the chooser, not the choice-maker.And you often see that problemwhen it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.Who are they actually supposed to be informing?My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.It turns out we can actuallyhandle a lot more information than we think we can,we've just got to take it a little easier.We have to gradually increase the complexity.I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.Let's take a very, very complicated decision:buying a car.Here's a German car manufacturerthat gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.You've got to make 60 different decisions,completely make up your car.Now these decisions varyin the number of choices that they offer per decision.Car colors, exterior car colors --I've got 56 choices.Engines, gearshift -- four choices.So now what I'm going to dois I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.So half of the customersare going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,to low choice, four gearshifts.The other half of the customersare going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,to 56 car colors, high choice.What am I going to look at?How engaged you are.If you keep hitting the default button per decision,that means you're getting overwhelmed,that means I'm losing you.What you findis the people who go from high choice to low choice,they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.We're losing them.They go from low choice to high choice,they're hanging in there.It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.The only thing that I have doneis I have varied the orderin which that information is presented.If I start you off easy,I learn how to choose.Even though choosing gearshiftdoesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,it still prepares me for how to choose.It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,so I'm more willing to be motivatedto be engaged.So let me recap.I have talked about four techniquesfor mitigating the problem of choice overload --cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives;concretize -- make it real;categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices;condition for complexity.All of these techniques that I'm describing to you todayare designed to help you manage your choices --better for you, you can use them on yourself,better for the people that you are serving.Because I believe that the keyto getting the most from choiceis to be choosy about choosing.And the more we're able to be choosy about choosingthe better we will be ableto practice the art of choosing.Thank you very much.(Applause)

I'm going to start here.This is a hand-lettered signthat appeared in a mom and pop bakeryin my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.The store owned one of those machinesthat can print on plates of sugar.And kids could bring in drawingsand have the store print a sugar platefor the top of their birthday cake.But unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to drawwas cartoon characters.They liked to draw the Little Mermaid,they'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse.But it turns out to be illegalto print a child's drawing of Micky Mouseonto a plate of sugar.And it's a copyright violation.And policing copyright violationsfor children's birthday cakeswas such a hasslethat the College Bakery said,"You know what, we're getting out of that business.If you're an amateur,you don't have access to our machine anymore.If you want a printed sugar birthday cake,you have to use one of our prefab images --only for professionals."So there's two bills in Congress right now.One is called SOPA, the other is called PIPA.SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.It's from the Senate.PIPA is short for PROTECTIP,which is itself short forPreventing Real Online Threatsto Economic Creativityand Theft of Intellectual Property --because the congressional aides who name these thingshave a lot of time on their hands.And what SOPA and PIPA want to dois they want to do this.They want to raise the costof copyright complianceto the point where people simply get out of the businessof offering it as a capability to amateurs.Now the way they propose to do thisis to identify sitesthat are substantially infringing on copyright --although how those sites are identifiedis never fully specified in the bills --and then they want to remove them from the domain name system.They want to take them out of the domain name system.Now the domain name systemis the thing that turns human-readable names, like Google.com,into the kinds of addressesmachines expect --74.125.226.212.Now the problem with this model of censorship,of identifying a siteand then trying to remove it from the domain name system,is that it won't work.And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law,but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much.Now the reason it won't workis that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browseror you can make it a clickable linkand you'll still go to Google.So the policing layeraround the problembecomes the real threat of the act.Now to understand how Congress came to write a billthat won't accomplish its stated goals,but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects,you have to understand a little bit about the back story.And the back story is this:SOPA and PIPA, as legislation,were drafted largely by media companiesthat were founded in the 20th century.The 20th century was a great time to be a media company,because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.If you were making a TV show,it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made;it only had to be betterthan the two other showsthat were on at the same time --which is a very low thresholdof competitive difficulty.Which meantthat if you fielded average content,you got a third of the U.S. public for free --tens of millions of usersfor simply doing somethingthat wasn't too terrible.This is like having a license to print moneyand a barrel of free ink.But technology moved on, as technology is wont to do.And slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century,that scarcity started to get eroded --and I don't mean by digital technology;I mean by analog technology.Cassette tapes, video cassette recorders,even the humble Xerox machinecreated new opportunitiesfor us to behave in waysthat astonished the media business.Because it turned outwe're not really couch potatoes.We don't really like to only consume.We do like to consume,but every time one of these new tools came along,it turned out we also like to produceand we like to share.And this freaked the media businesses out --it freaked them out every time.Jack Valenti, who was the head lobbyistfor the Motion Picture Association of America,once likened the ferocious video cassette recorderto Jack the Ripperand poor, helpless Hollywoodto a woman at home alone.That was the level of rhetoric.And so the media industriesbegged, insisted, demandedthat Congress do something.And Congress did something.By the early 90s, Congress passed the lawthat changed everything.And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Actof 1992.What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was,look, if people are taping stuff off the radioand then making mixtapes for their friends,that is not a crime. That's okay.Taping and remixingand sharing with your friends is okay.If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them,that's not okay.But this taping business,fine, let it go.And they thought that they clarified the issue,because they'd set out a clear distinctionbetween legal and illegal copying.But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted.They had wanted Congressto outlaw copying full-stop.So when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed,the media businesses gave up on the ideaof legal versus illegal distinctions for copyingbecause it was clearthat if Congress was acting in their framework,they might actually increase the rights of citizensto participate in our own media environment.So they went for plan B.It took them a while to formulate plan B.Plan B appeared in its first full-blown formin 1998 --something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.It was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts.But the main thrust of the DMCAwas that it was legal to sell youuncopyable digital material --except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material.It would be, as Ed Felton once famously said,"Like handing out waterthat wasn't wet."Bits are copyable. That's what computers do.That is a side effect of their ordinary operation.So in order to fake the abilityto sell uncopyable bits,the DMCA also made it legalto force you to use systemsthat broke the copying function of your devices.Every DVD player and game playerand television and computer you brought home --no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it --could be broken by the content industries,if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content.And to make sure you didn't realize,or didn't enact their capabilitiesas general purpose computing devices,they also made it illegalfor you to try to resetthe copyability of that content.The DMCA marks the momentwhen the media industriesgave up on the legal systemof distinguishing between legal and illegal copyingand simply tried to prevent copyingthrough technical means.Now the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects,but in this one domain, limiting sharing,it has mostly not worked.And the main reason it hasn't workedis the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerfulthan anyone imagined.The mixtape, the fanzine,that was nothing compared to what we're seeing nowwith the Internet.We are in a worldwhere most American citizensover the age of 12share things with each other online.We share written things, we share images,we share audio, we share video.Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made.Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found.Some of the stuff we shareis stuff we've made out of what we've found,and all of it horrifies those industries.So PIPA and SOPAare round two.But where the DMCA was surgical --we want to go down into your computer,we want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine,and prevent it from doingwhat they said it would do at the store --PIPA and SOPA are nuclearand they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the worldand censor content.Now the mechanism, as I said, for doing this,is you need to take out anybodypointing to those IP addresses.You need to take them out of search engines,you need to take them out of online directories,you need to take them out of user lists.And because the biggest producers of content on the Internetare not Google and Yahoo,they're us,we're the people getting policed.Because in the end,the real threatto the enactment of PIPA and SOPAis our ability to share things with one another.So what PIPA and SOPA risk doingis taking a centuries-old legal concept,innocent until proven guilty,and reversing it --guilty until proven innocent.You can't shareuntil you show usthat you're not sharing somethingwe don't like.Suddenly, the burden of proof for legal versus illegalfalls affirmatively on usand on the servicesthat might be offering us any new capabilities.And if it costs even a dimeto police a user,that will crush a servicewith a hundred million users.So this is the Internet they have in mind.Imagine this sign everywhere --except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery,imagine it says YouTubeand Facebook and Twitter.Imagine it says TED,because the comments can't be policedat any acceptable cost.The real effects of SOPA and PIPAare going to be different than the proposed effects.The threat, in fact,is this inversion of the burden of proof,where we suddenlyare all treated like thievesat every moment we're given the freedom to create,to produce or to share.And the people who provide those capabilities to us --the YouTubes, the Facebooks, the Twitters and TEDs --are in the businessof having to police us,or being on the hook for contributory infringement.There's two things you can doto help stop this --a simple thing and a complicated thing,an easy thing and a hard thing.The simple thing, the easy thing, is this:if you're an American citizen,call your representative, call your senator.When you look atthe people who co-signed on the SOPA bill,people who've co-signed on PIPA,what you see is that they have cumulatively receivedmillions and millions of dollarsfrom the traditional media industries.You don't have millions and millions of dollars,but you can call your representatives,and you can remind them that you vote,and you can ask not to be treated like a thief,and you can suggest that you would preferthat the Internet not be broken.And if you're not an American citizen,you can contact American citizens that you knowand encourage them to do the same.Because this seems like a national issue,but it is not.These industries will not be contentwith breaking our Internet.If they break it, they will break it for everybody.That's the easy thing.That's the simple thing.The hard thing is this:get ready, because more is coming.SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA,which was purposed last year, which did not pass.And all of this goes backto the failure of the DMCAto disallow sharing as a technical means.And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act,which horrified those industries.Because the whole businessof actually suggesting that someone is breaking the lawand then gathering evidence and proving that,that turns out to be really inconvenient."We'd prefer not to do that,"says the content industries.And what they want is not to have to do that.They don't want legal distinctionsbetween legal and illegal sharing.They just want the sharing to go away.PIPA and SOPA are not oddities, they're not anomalies,they're not events.They're the next turn of this particular screw,which has been going on 20 years now.And if we defeat these, as I hope we do,more is coming.Because until we convince Congressthat the way to deal with copyright violationis the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster, with YouTube,which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidenceand the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remediesthat goes on in democratic societies.That's the way to handle this.In the meantime,the hard thing to do is to be ready.Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA.Time Warner has calledand they want us all back on the couch,just consuming --not producing, not sharing --and we should say, "No."Thank you.(Applause)

I'm going to start here.This is a hand-lettered signthat appeared in a mom and pop bakeryin my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.The store owned one of those machinesthat can print on plates of sugar.And kids could bring in drawingsand have the store print a sugar platefor the top of their birthday cake.But unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to drawwas cartoon characters.They liked to draw the Little Mermaid,they'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse.But it turns out to be illegalto print a child's drawing of Micky Mouseonto a plate of sugar.And it's a copyright violation.And policing copyright violationsfor children's birthday cakeswas such a hasslethat the College Bakery said,"You know what, we're getting out of that business.If you're an amateur,you don't have access to our machine anymore.If you want a printed sugar birthday cake,you have to use one of our prefab images --only for professionals."So there's two bills in Congress right now.One is called SOPA, the other is called PIPA.SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.It's from the Senate.PIPA is short for PROTECTIP,which is itself short forPreventing Real Online Threatsto Economic Creativityand Theft of Intellectual Property --because the congressional aides who name these thingshave a lot of time on their hands.And what SOPA and PIPA want to dois they want to do this.They want to raise the costof copyright complianceto the point where people simply get out of the businessof offering it as a capability to amateurs.Now the way they propose to do thisis to identify sitesthat are substantially infringing on copyright --although how those sites are identifiedis never fully specified in the bills --and then they want to remove them from the domain name system.They want to take them out of the domain name system.Now the domain name systemis the thing that turns human-readable names, like Google.com,into the kinds of addressesmachines expect --74.125.226.212.Now the problem with this model of censorship,of identifying a siteand then trying to remove it from the domain name system,is that it won't work.And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law,but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much.Now the reason it won't workis that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browseror you can make it a clickable linkand you'll still go to Google.So the policing layeraround the problembecomes the real threat of the act.Now to understand how Congress came to write a billthat won't accomplish its stated goals,but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects,you have to understand a little bit about the back story.And the back story is this:SOPA and PIPA, as legislation,were drafted largely by media companiesthat were founded in the 20th century.The 20th century was a great time to be a media company,because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.If you were making a TV show,it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made;it only had to be betterthan the two other showsthat were on at the same time --which is a very low thresholdof competitive difficulty.Which meantthat if you fielded average content,you got a third of the U.S. public for free --tens of millions of usersfor simply doing somethingthat wasn't too terrible.This is like having a license to print moneyand a barrel of free ink.But technology moved on, as technology is wont to do.And slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century,that scarcity started to get eroded --and I don't mean by digital technology;I mean by analog technology.Cassette tapes, video cassette recorders,even the humble Xerox machinecreated new opportunitiesfor us to behave in waysthat astonished the media business.Because it turned outwe're not really couch potatoes.We don't really like to only consume.We do like to consume,but every time one of these new tools came along,it turned out we also like to produceand we like to share.And this freaked the media businesses out --it freaked them out every time.Jack Valenti, who was the head lobbyistfor the Motion Picture Association of America,once likened the ferocious video cassette recorderto Jack the Ripperand poor, helpless Hollywoodto a woman at home alone.That was the level of rhetoric.And so the media industriesbegged, insisted, demandedthat Congress do something.And Congress did something.By the early 90s, Congress passed the lawthat changed everything.And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Actof 1992.What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was,look, if people are taping stuff off the radioand then making mixtapes for their friends,that is not a crime. That's okay.Taping and remixingand sharing with your friends is okay.If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them,that's not okay.But this taping business,fine, let it go.And they thought that they clarified the issue,because they'd set out a clear distinctionbetween legal and illegal copying.But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted.They had wanted Congressto outlaw copying full-stop.So when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed,the media businesses gave up on the ideaof legal versus illegal distinctions for copyingbecause it was clearthat if Congress was acting in their framework,they might actually increase the rights of citizensto participate in our own media environment.So they went for plan B.It took them a while to formulate plan B.Plan B appeared in its first full-blown formin 1998 --something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.It was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts.But the main thrust of the DMCAwas that it was legal to sell youuncopyable digital material --except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material.It would be, as Ed Felton once famously said,"Like handing out waterthat wasn't wet."Bits are copyable. That's what computers do.That is a side effect of their ordinary operation.So in order to fake the abilityto sell uncopyable bits,the DMCA also made it legalto force you to use systemsthat broke the copying function of your devices.Every DVD player and game playerand television and computer you brought home --no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it --could be broken by the content industries,if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content.And to make sure you didn't realize,or didn't enact their capabilitiesas general purpose computing devices,they also made it illegalfor you to try to resetthe copyability of that content.The DMCA marks the momentwhen the media industriesgave up on the legal systemof distinguishing between legal and illegal copyingand simply tried to prevent copyingthrough technical means.Now the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects,but in this one domain, limiting sharing,it has mostly not worked.And the main reason it hasn't workedis the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerfulthan anyone imagined.The mixtape, the fanzine,that was nothing compared to what we're seeing nowwith the Internet.We are in a worldwhere most American citizensover the age of 12share things with each other online.We share written things, we share images,we share audio, we share video.Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made.Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found.Some of the stuff we shareis stuff we've made out of what we've found,and all of it horrifies those industries.So PIPA and SOPAare round two.But where the DMCA was surgical --we want to go down into your computer,we want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine,and prevent it

Do you remember the storyof Odysseus and the Sirensfrom high school or junior high school?There was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back homeafter the Trojan War.And he's standing on the deck of his ship,he's talking to his first mate,and he's saying,"Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks,and on those rocks sit some beautiful womencalled Sirens.And these women sing an enchanting song,a song so alluringthat all sailors who hear itcrash into the rocks and die."Now you would expect, given that,that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens,but instead Odysseus says,"I want to hear that song.And so what I'm going to dois I'm going to pour wax in the earsof you and all the men --stay with me --so that you can't hear the song,and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mastso that I can listenand we can all sail by unaffected."So this is a captainputting the life of every single person on the ship at riskso that he can hear a song.And I'd like to think if this was the case,they probably would have rehearsed it a few times.Odysseus would have said, "Okay, let's do a dry run.You tie me to the mast, and I'm going to beg and plead.And no matter what I say, you cannot untie me from the mast.All right, so tie me to the mast."And the first mate takes a ropeand ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot.And Odysseus does his best job playactingand says, "Untie me. Untie me.I want to hear that song. Untie me."And the first mate wisely resistsand doesn't untie Odysseus.And then Odysseus says, "I see that you can get it.All right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner."And the first mate hesitates.He's like, "Is this still the rehearsal,or should I untie him?"And the first mate thinks,"Well, I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end."So he unties Odysseus, and Odysseus flips out.He's like, "You idiot. You moron.If you do that tomorrow, I'll be dead, you'll be dead,every single one of the men will be dead.Now just don't untie me no matter what."He throws the first mate to the ground.This repeats itself through the night --rehearsal, tying to the mast,conning his way out of it,beating the poor first mate up mercilessly.Hilarity ensues.Tying yourself to a mastis perhaps the oldest written exampleof what psychologists call a commitment device.A commitment device is a decision that you makewith a cool head to bind yourselfso that you don't do something regrettablewhen you have a hot head.Because there's two heads inside one personwhen you think about it.Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selveswhen it comes to questions of temptation.There is first, the present self.This is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song.He just wants to get to the front row.He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification.But then there's this other self, the future self.This is Odysseus as an old manwho wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villawith his wife Penelopeoutside of Ithaca -- the other one.So why do we need commitment devices?Well resisting temptation is hard,as the 19th century English economistNassau William Senior said,"To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power,or to seek distant rather than immediate results,are among the most painful exertionsof the human will."If you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people,you probably realizeit's not that your goals are physically impossiblethat's keeping you from achieving them,it's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them.It's physically possible to lose weight.It's physically possible to exercise more.But resisting temptationis hard.The other reasonthat it's difficult to resist temptationis because it's an unequal battlebetween the present self and the future self.I mean, let's face it, the present self is present.It's in control. It's in power right now.It has these strong, heroic armsthat can lift doughnuts into your mouth.And the future self is not even around.It's off in the future. It's weak.It doesn't even have a lawyer present.There's nobody to stick up for the future self.And so the present self can trounceall over its dreams.So there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought,and we need commitment devicesto level the playing field between the two.Now I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually.Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one, but there are other onessuch as locking a credit card away with a keyor not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat itor unplugging your Internet connectionso you can use your computer.I was creating commitment devices of my ownlong before I knew what they were.So when I was a starving post-docat Columbia University,I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career.I had to write five pages a daytowards papersor I would have to give up five dollars.And when you try to execute these commitment devices,you realize the devil is really in the details.Because it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars.I mean, you can't burn it; that's illegal.And I thought, well I could give it to a charityor give it to my wife or something like that.But then I thought, oh, I'm sending myself mixed messages.Because not writing is bad, but giving to charity is good.So then I would kind of justify not writingby giving a gift.And then I kind of flipped that around and thought,well I could give it to the neo-Nazis.But then I was like, that's more bad than writing is good,and so that wouldn't work.So ultimately, I just decidedI would leave it in an envelope on the subway.Sometimes a good person would find it,sometimes a bad person would find it.On average, it was just a completely pointless exchange of moneythat I would regret.(Laughter)Such it is with commitment devices.But despite my like for them,there's two nagging concernsthat I've always had about commitment devices,and you might feel this if you use them yourself.So the first is,when you've got one of these devices going,such as this contract to write everyday or pay,it's just a constant reminderthat you have no self-control.You're just telling yourself, "Without you, commitment device,I am nothing, I have no self-discipline."And then when you're ever in a situationwhere you don't have a commitment device in place --like, "Oh my God, that person's offering me a doughnut,and I have no defense mechanism," --you just eat it.So I don't like the way that they take the power away from you.I think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.The other problem with commitment devicesis that you can always weasel your way out of them.You say, "Well, of course I can't write today,because I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews,and then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that.And so there's no way that this is going to work."So in effect, you are like Odysseus and the first matein one person.You're putting yourself, you're binding yourself,and you're weaseling your way out of it,and then you're beating yourself up afterwards.So I've been workingfor about a decade nowon finding other waysto change people's relationship to the future selfwithout using commitment devices.In particular, I'm interested in the relationshipto the future financial self.And this is a timely issue.I'm talking about the topic of saving.Now saving is a classic two selves problem.The present self does not want to save at all.It wants to consume.Whereas the future self wants the present self to save.So this is a timely problem.We look at the savings rateand it has been declining since the 1950s.At the same time, the Retirement Risk Index,the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement,has been increasing.And we're at a situation nowwhere for every three baby boomers,the McKinsey Global Institute predictsthat two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needswhile they're in retirement.So what can we do about this?There's a philosopher, Derek Parfit,who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I.He said that, "We might neglect our future selvesbecause of some failure of belief or imagination."That is to say,we somehow might not believe that we're going to get old,or we might not be able to imaginethat we're going to get old some day.On the one hand, it sounds ridiculous.Of course, we know that we're going to get old.But aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time?So my coauthors and I have used computers,the greatest tool of our time,to assist people's imaginationand help them imagine what it might be liketo go into the future.And I'll show you some of these tools right here.The first is called the distribution builder.It shows people what the future might be likeby showing them a hundred equally probable outcomesthat might be obtained in the future.Each outcome is shown by one of these markers,and each sits on a rowthat represents a level of wealth and retirement.Being up at the topmeans that you're enjoying a high income in retirement.Being down at the bottommeans that you're struggling to make ends meet.When you make an investment,what you're really saying is, "I acceptthat any one of these 100 thingscould happen to me and determine my wealth."Now you can try to move your outcomes around.You can try to manipulate your fate, like this person is doing,but it costs you something to do it.It means that you have to save more today.Once you find an investment that you're happy with,what people do is they click "done"and the markers begin to disappear,slowly, one by one.It simulates what it is like to invest in somethingand to watch that investment pan out.At the end, there will only be one marker left standingand it will determine our wealth in retirement.Yes, this person retiredat 150 percent of their working income in retirement.They're making more money while retiredthan they were making while they were working.If you're like most people,just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy --just to think about making50 percent more money in retirement than before.However, had you ended up on the very bottom,it might have given you a slight senseof dread and/or nauseathinking about struggling to get by in retirement.By using this tool over and overand simulating outcome after outcome,people can understandthat the investments and savings that they undertake todaydetermine their well-being in the future.Now people are motivated through emotions,but different people find different things motivating.This is a simulationthat uses graphics,but other people find motivating what money can buy,not just numbers.So here I made a distribution builderwhere instead of showing numerical outcomes,I show people what those outcomes will get you,in particular apartments that you can affordif you're retiring on 3,000, 2,500,2,000 dollars per month and so on.As you move down the ladder of apartments,you see that they get worse and worse.Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student.And as you get to the very bottom,you're faced with the unfortunate realitythat if you don't save anything for retirement,you won't be able to afford any housing at all.Those are actual pictures of actual apartmentsrenting for that amountas advertised on the Internet.The last thing I'll show you,the last behavioral time machine,is something that I created with Hal Hershfield,who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project,Bill Sharpe.And what it isis an exploration into virtual reality.So what we do is we take pictures of people --in this case, college-age people --and we use software to age themand show these people what they'll look likewhen they're 60, 70, 80 years old.And we try to testwhether actually assisting your imaginationby looking at the face of your future selfcan change you investment behavior.So this is one of our experiments.Here we see the face of the young subject on the left.He's given a controlthat allows him to adjust his savings rate.As he moves his savings rate down,it means that he's saving zerowhen it's all the way here at the left.You can see his current annual income --this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today --is quite high, 91 percent,but his retirement income is quite low.He's going to retire on 44 percentof what he earned while he was working.If he saves the maximum legal amount,his retirement income goes up,but he's unhappybecause now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today.Other conditions show people the future self.And from the future self's point of view, everything is in reverse.If you save very little,the future self is unhappyliving on 44 percent of the income.Whereas if the present self saves a lot,the future self is delighted,where the income is close up near 100 percent.To bring this to a wider audience,I've been working with Hal and Allianzto create something we call the behavioral time machine,in which you not only get to see yourself in the future,but you get to see anticipated emotional reactionsto different levels of retirement wealth.So for instance,here is somebody using the tool.And just watch the facial expressionsas they move the slider.The younger face gets happier and happier, saving nothing.The older face is miserable.And slowly, slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate.And then it's a high savings rate.The younger face is getting unhappy.The older face is quite pleasedwith the decision.We're going to see if this has an effect on what people do.And what's nice about itis it's not something that biasing people actually,because as one face smiles,the other face frowns.It's not telling you which way to put the slider,it's just reminding you that you areconnected to and legally tied tothis future self.Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being.And that's something that's easy to forget.This use of virtual realityis not just good for making people look older.There are programs you can getto see how people might lookif they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun,if they gain weight and so on.And what's good is,unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith,you don't have to program these by yourselfin order to see the virtual reality.There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollarsthat do the same thing.This is actually a picture of Hal, my coauthor.You might recognize him from the previous demos.And just for kicks we ran his picturethrough the balding, aging and weight gain softwareto see how he would look.Hal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourselfto disabuse you of that last image.And I'll close it there.On behalf of Hal and myself,I wish all the best to your present and future selves.Thank you.(Applause)

Ben Roche: So I'm Ben, by the way.Homaro Cantu: And I'm Homaro.BR: And we're chefs. So when Motoopened in 2004, people didn't really knowwhat to expect. A lot of people thoughtthat it was a Japanese restaurant, andmaybe it was the name, maybe it wasthe logo, which was like a Japanesecharacter, but anyway, we had all theserequests for Japanese food, which isreally not what we did. And after aboutthe ten thousandth request for a maki roll,we decided to give the peoplewhat they wanted. So this picture isan example of printed food, and this wasthe first foray into what we like to callflavor transformation. So this is allthe ingredients, all the flavor of, you know,a standard maki roll, printed ontoa little piece of paper.HC: So our diners started to get boredwith this idea, and we decided to give themthe same course twice, so here we actuallytook an element from the maki roll andand took a picture of a dish and thenbasically served that picture with the dish.So this dish in particular is basicallychampagne with seafood.The champagne grapes that you see areactually carbonated grapes. A little bit ofseafood and some crème fraiche and thepicture actually tastes exactly like the dish. (Laughter)BR: But it's not all just edible pictures.We decided to do somethinga little bit different and transform flavorsthat were very familiar -- so in this case,we have carrot cake.So we take a carrot cake, put itin a blender, and we have kind of likea carrot cake juice, and then that went intoa balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to createthis hollow shell of carrot cakeice cream, I guess, and it comes offlooking like, you know,Jupiter's floating around your plate.So yeah, we're transforming things intosomething that you have absolutelyno reference for.HC: And here's something we have noreference to eat. This is a cigar, andbasically it's a Cuban cigar made out ofa Cuban pork sandwich, so we take thesespices that go into the pork shoulder,we fashion that into ash. We takethe sandwich and wrap it up ina collard green, put an edible labelthat bears no similarity toa Cohiba cigar label, and we put itin a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and chargeyou about twenty bucks for it. (Laughter)HC: Delicious.BR: That's not it, though.Instead of making foods thatlook like things that you wouldn't eat,we decided to make ingredientslook like dishes that you know.So this is a plate of nachos.The difference between our nachosand the other guy's nachos,is that this is actually a dessert.So the chips are candied,the ground beef is made from chocolate,and the cheese is made from a shreddedmango sorbet that gets shreddedinto liquid nitrogen to look like cheese.And after doing all of thisdematerialization and reconfiguringof this, of these ingredients, we realizedthat it was pretty cool,because as we served it, we learned thatthe dish actually behaves like the real thing,where the cheese begins to melt.So when you're looking at this thingin the dining room, you have this sensationthat this is actually a plate of nachos,and it's not really until you begin tasting itthat you realize this is a dessert, andit's just kind of like a mind-ripper.(Laughter)HC: So we had been creatingall of these dishes out of akitchen that was more likea mechanic's shop than a kitchen, andthe next logical step for us was to installa state-of-the-art laboratory,and that's what we have here.So we put this in the basement, and wegot really serious about food, likeserious experimentation.BR: One of the really cool things aboutthe lab, besides that we have a newscience lab in the kitchen, is that,you know, with this new equipment, andthis new approach, all thesedifferent doors to creativity that we neverknew were there began to open, and so theexperiments and the food and the dishesthat we created, they just kept goingfurther and further out there.HC: Let's talk about flavor transformation,and let's actually make some cool stuff.You see a cow with its tongue hanging out.What I see is a cow about to eat somethingdelicious. What is that cow eating?And why is it delicious?So the cow, basically, eats three basicthings in their feed: corn, beets, and barley,and so what I do is I actuallychallenge my staff with these crazy,wild ideas. Can we take what the coweats, remove the cow, and then makesome hamburgers out of that?And basically the reaction tends to bekind of like this. (Laughter)BR: Yeah, that's our chef de cuisine,Chris Jones. This is not the only guythat just flips out when we assigna ridiculous task, but a lot of these ideas,they're hard to understand.They're hard to just get automatically.There's a lot of research and a lot offailure, trial and error -- I guess, more error --that goes into each and every dish,so we don't always get it right, and it takesa while for us to be able to explain thatto people.HC: So, after about a day of Chris and Istaring at each other, we came up withsomething that was pretty closeto the hamburger patty, and as you cansee it basically forms like hamburger meat.This is made from three ingredients:beets, barley, corn, and so itactually cooks up like hamburger meat,looks and tastes like hamburger meat,and not only that, but it's basicallyremoving the cow from the equation.So replicating food, taking it into thatnext level is where we're going.(Applause)BR: And it's definitely the world's firstbleeding veggie burger,which is a cool side effect.And a miracle berry, if you're not familiarwith it, is a natural ingredient, and itcontains a special property.It's a glycoprotein called miraculin,a naturally occurring thing. It still freaksme out every time I eat it, but it has aunique ability to mask certain tastereceptors on your tongue, so that primarilysour taste receptors, so normally thingsthat would taste very sour or tart,somehow begin to taste very sweet.HC: You're about to eat a lemon,and now it tastes like lemonade.Let's just stop and think about theeconomic benefits of something like that.We could eliminate sugar across the boardfor all confectionary products and sodas,and we can replace it withall-natural fresh fruit.BR: So you see us here cutting upsome watermelon. The idea with thisis that we're going to eliminate tons offood miles, wasted energy,and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna,or any exotic produce or itemfrom a very far-away place,with local, organic produce;so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin.HC: So if miracle berries take sour thingsand turn them into sweet things,we have this other pixie dustthat we put on the watermelon, and itmakes it go from sweet to savory.So after we do that, we put it intoa vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed,some spices, and we roll it, and thisstarts taking on the appearance of tuna.So the key now is to make itbehave like tuna.BR: And then after a quick dip into someliquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear,we really have something that looks,tastes and behaves like the real thing.HC: So the key thing to remember here is,we don't really carewhat this tuna really is.As long as it's good for you and good forthe environment, it doesn't matter.But where is this going?How can we take this idea of tricking yourtastebuds and leapfrog it into somethingthat we can do today that could bea disruptive food technology?So here's the next challenge.I told the staff, let's just take a bunchof wild plants, think of them asfood ingredients. As long as they'renon-poisonous to the human body,go out around Chicago sidewalks,take it, blend it, cook it and thenhave everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto.Let's charge them a boatload of cash for thisand see what they think. (Laughter)BR: Yeah, so you can imagine, a tasklike this -- this is another one of thoseassignments that the kitchen staffhated us for. But we really had to almostrelearn how to cook in general,because these are ingredients, you know,plant life that we're, one, unfamiliar with,and two, we have no reference for howto cook these things becausepeople don't eat them.So we really had to think about new, creative waysto flavor, new ways to cookand to change texture -- and that wasthe main issue with this challenge.HC: So this is where we step into the futureand we leapfrog ahead.So developing nationsand first-world nations,imagine if you could take these wild plantsand consume them, food miles wouldbasically turn into food feet.This disruptive mentality of what food iswould essentially open up the encyclopediaof what raw ingredients are, even if we justswapped out, say, one of these for flour,that would eliminate so much energyand so much waste.And to give you a simple example here as towhat we actually fed these customers,there's a bale of hay thereand some crab apples.And basically we took hay and crab applesand made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients.People swore they were eatingbarbecue sauce, and this is free food.BR: Thanks, guys.(Applause)

I'm here to talk to youabout the economic invisibility of nature.The bad newsis that mother nature's back office isn't working yet,so those invoices don't get issued.But we need to do something about this problem.I began my life as a markets professionaland continued to take an interest,but most of my recent efforthas been looking at the valueof what comes to human beings from nature,and which doesn't get priced by the markets.A project called TEEB was started in 2007,and it was launched by a group of environment ministersof the G8+5.And their basic inspirationwas a stern review of Lord Stern.They asked themselves a question:If economics could make such a convincing casefor early action on climate change,well why can't the same be done for conservation?Why can't an equivalent case be madefor nature?And the answer is: Yeah, it can.But it's not that straightforward.Biodiversity, the living fabric of this planet, is not a gas.It exists in many layers,ecosystems, species and genes across many scales --international, national, local, community --and doing for naturewhat Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy.And yet, we began.We began the project with an interim report,which quickly pulled togethera lot of information that had been collected on the subjectby many, many researchers.And amongst our compiled resultswas the startling revelationthat, in fact, we were losing natural capital --the benefits that flow from nature to us.We were losing it at an extraordinary rate --in fact, of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worthof natural capital.This came out in 2008,which was, of course, around the time that the banking crisis had shownthat we had lost financial capitalof the order of two and a half trillion dollars.So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss.We then have gone on sinceto present for [the] international community,for governments,for local governments and for businessand for people, for you and me,a whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year,which address the economic invisibility of natureand describe what can be done to solve it.What is this about?A picture that you're familiar with --the Amazon rainforests.It's a massive store of carbon, it's an amazing store of biodiversity,but what people don't really knowis this also is a rain factory.Because the northeastern trade winds,as they go over the Amazonas,effectively gather the water vapor.Something like 20 billion tons per day of water vaporis sucked up by the northeastern trade winds,and eventually precipitates in the form of rainacross the La Plata Basin.This rainfall cycle, this rainfall factory,effectively feeds an agricultural economyof the order of 240 billion dollars-worthin Latin America.But the question arises: Okay, so how muchdo Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentinaand indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazilpay for that vital input to that economyto the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall?And the answer is zilch,exactly zero.That's the economic invisibility of nature.That can't keep going on,because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful.Economics has become the currency of policy.And unless we addressthis invisibility,we are going to get the results that we are seeing,which is a gradual degradation and lossof this valuable natural asset.It's not just about the Amazonas, or indeed about rainforests.No matter what level you look at,whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level,we see the same problem again and again.So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforestsat an ecosystem level.At the species level,it's been estimated that insect-based pollination,bees pollinating fruit and so on,is something like 190 billion dollars-worth.That's something like eight percentof the total agricultural output globally.It completely passes below the radar screen.But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice?Or for that matter, if you look at the genetic level,60 percent of medicines were prospected,were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef.Once again, most of that doesn't get paid.And that brings me to another aspect of this,which is, to whom should this get paid?That genetic materialprobably belonged, if it could belong to anyone,to a local community of poor peoplewho parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule,which then became the medicine.They were the ones that didn't get paid.And if you look at the species level,you saw about fish.Today, the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significantthat effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor,the artisanal fisher folkand those who fish for their own livelihoods,to feed their families.Something like a billion people depend on fish,the quantity of fish in the oceans.A billion people depend on fishfor their main source for animal protein.And at this rate at which we are losing fish,it is a human problem of enormous dimensions,a health problemof a kind we haven't seen before.And finally, at the ecosystem level,whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests,or whether it is the ability of poor farmersto go out and gather leaf litterfor their cattle and goats,or whether it's the ability of their wivesto go and collect fuel wood from the forest,it is actually the poorwho depend most on these ecosystem services.We did estimates in our studythat for countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia,even though ecosystem services --these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free --they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP --two, four, eight, 10, 15 percent --but in these countries, if we measure how much they're worth to the poor,the answers are more like45 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent.That's the difference.Because these are important benefits for the poor.And you can't really have a proper model for developmentif at the same time you're destroying or allowingthe degradation of the very asset, the most important asset,which is your development asset,that is ecological infrastructure.How bad can things get?Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance.It's basically a measureof how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on averageof biomass of various species are around.The green represents the percentage.If you start green, it's like 80 to 100 percent.If it's yellow, it's 40 to 60 percent.And these are percentages versus the original state, so to speak,the pre-industrial era, 1750.Now I'm going to show youhow business as usual will affect this.And just watch the change in colorsin India, China, Europe,sub-Saharan Africaas we move on and consume global biomassat a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us.See that again.The only places that remain green -- and that's not good news --is, in fact, places like the Gobi Desert,like the tundra and like the Sahara.But that doesn't help because there were very few speciesand volume of biomass there in the first place.This is the challenge.The reason this is happeningboils down, in my mind, to one basic problem,which is our inability to perceive the differencebetween public benefitsand private profits.We tend to constantly ignore public wealthsimply because it is in the common wealth,it's common goods.And here's an example from Thailandwhere we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much --it's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured --compared to its value as a shrimp farm,which is more like $9,600,there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangrovesand convert them to shrimp farms.But of course, if you look at exactly what those profits are,almost 8,000 of those dollarsare, in fact, subsidies.So you compare the two sides of the coinand you find that it's more like 1,200 to 600.That's not that hard.But on the other hand, if you start measuring,how much would it actually costto restore the land of the shrimp farmback to productive use?Once salt deposition and chemical depositionhas had its effects,that answer is more like $12,000 of cost.And if you see the benefits of the mangrovein terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you getand in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries,that provide fish for the poor,that answer is more like $11,000.So now look at the different lens.If you look at the lens of public wealthas against the lens of private profits,you get a completely different answer,which is clearly conservation makes more sense,and not destruction.So is this just a story from South Thailand?Sorry, this is a global story.And here's what the same calculation looks like,which was done recently -- well I say recently, over the last 10 years --by a group called TRUCOST.And they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations,what are the externalities?In other words, what are the costs of doing business as usual?This is not illegal stuff, this is basically business as usual,which causes climate-changing emissions, which have an economic cost.It causes pollutants being issued, which have an economic cost,health cost and so on.Use of freshwater.If you drill water to make coke near a village farm,that's not illegal, but yes, it costs the community.Can we stop this, and how?I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital.Basically the stuff of life is natural capital,and we need to recognize and build that into our systems.When we measure GDPas a measure of economic performance at the national level,we don't include our biggest asset at the country level.When we measure corporate performances,we don't include our impacts on natureand what our business costs society.That has to stop.In fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase.I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project.That was in the early 2000swhen India was going gung-ho about GDP growthas the means forward --looking at China with its stellar growths of eight, nine, 10 percentand wondering, why can we do the same?And a few friends of mine and Idecided this doesn't make sense.This is going to create more cost to society and more losses.So we decided to do a massive set of calculationsand started producing green accounts for India and its states.That's how my interests beganand went to the TEEB project.Calculating this at the national level is one thing, and it has begun.And the World Bank has acknowledged thisand they've started a project called WAVES --Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services.But calculating this at the next level,that means at the business sector level, is important.And actually we've done this with the TEEB project.We've done this for a very difficult case,which was for deforestation in China.This is important, because in China in 1997,the Yellow River actually went dry for nine monthscausing severe loss of agriculture outputand pain and loss to society.Just a year later the Yangtze flooded,causing something like 5,500 deaths.So clearly there was a problem with deforestation.It was associated largely with the construction industry.And the Chinese government responded sensiblyand placed a ban on felling.A retrospective on 40 yearsshows that if we had accounted for these costs --the cost of loss of topsoil,the cost of loss of waterways,the lost productivity, the loss to local communitiesas a result of all these factors,desertification and so on --those costs are almost twice as muchas the market price of timber.So in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplaceought to have been three-times what it washad it reflected the true pain and the coststo the society within China.Of course, after the event one can be wise.The way to do this is to do it on a company basis,to take leadership forward,and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost,and to disclose these answers.Someone once asked me, "Who is better or worse,is it Unilever or is it P&amp;Gwhen it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?"And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies,good though they are and professional though they are,do not calculate or disclose their externalities.But if we look at companies like PUMA --Jochen Zeitz, their CEO and chairman,once challenged me at a function,saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it.Well I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it.He's basically worked the cost to PUMA.PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover,300 million dollars of profits,200 million dollars after tax,94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business.Now that's not a happy situation for them,but they have the confidence and the courageto come forward and say, "Here's what we are measuring.We are measuring it because we knowthat you cannot manage what you do not measure."That's an example, I think, for us to look atand for us to draw comfort from.If more companies did this,and if more sectors engaged this as sectors,you could have analysts, business analysts,and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOsactually look and compare the social performance of companies.Today we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out.This can be done.And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.has already set up a coalition to do this,an international coalition.The other favorite, if you like, solution for meis the creation of green carbon markets.And by the way, these are my favorites --externalities calculation and green carbon markets.TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutionsincluding protected area evaluationand payments for ecosystem servicesand eco-certification and you name it, but these are the favorites.What's green carbon?Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace.It's about energy emissions.The European Union ETS is the main marketplace.It's not doing too well. We've over-issued.A bit like inflation: you over-issue currency,you get what you see, declining prices.But that's all about energy and industry.But what we're missing is also some other emissionslike black carbon, that is soot.What we're also missing is blue carbon,which, by the way, is the largest store of carbon --more than 55 percent.Thankfully, the flux, in other words, the flow of emissionsfrom the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa,is more or less balanced.In fact, what's being absorbedis something like 25 percent of our emissions,which then leads to acidificationor lower alkalinity in oceans.More of that in a minute.And finally, there's deforestation,and there's emission of methanefrom agriculture.Green carbon,which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions,and blue carbontogether comprise 25 percent of our emissions.We have the means already in our hands,through a structure, through a mechanism, called REDD Plus --a scheme for the reduced emissionsfrom deforestation and forest degradation.And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars eachtowards Indonesia and Brazilto implement this Red Plus scheme.So we actually have some movement forward.But the thing is to do a lot more of that.Will this solve the problem? Will economics solve everything?Well I'm afraid not.There is an area that is the oceans, coral reefs.As you can see,they cut across the entire globeall the way from Micronesiaacross Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Madagascarand to the West of the Caribbean.These red dots, these red areas,basically provide the food and livelihoodfor more than half a billion people.So that's almost an eighth of society.And the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost --and scientists tell usthat any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per millionis too dangerous for the survival of these reefs --we are not only risking the extinctionof the entire coral species, the warm water corals,we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans,but we are risking the very lives and livelihoodsof more than 500 million peoplewho live in the developing world in poor countries.So in selecting targets of 450 parts per millionand selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations,what we have done is we've made an ethical choice.We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in societyto not have coral reefs.Well what I will say to you in partingis that we may have done that.Let's think about it and what it means,but please, let's not do more of that.Because mother nature only has that muchin ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital.I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices.Thank you.(Applause)

sense.This is going to create more cost to society and more losses.So we decided to do a massive set of calculationsand started producing green accounts for India and its states.That's how my interests beganand went to the TEEB project.Calculating this at the national level is one thing, and it has begun.And the World Bank has acknowledged thisand they've started a project called WAVES --Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services.But calculating this at the next level,that means at the business sector level, is important.And actually we've done this with the TEEB project.We've done this for a very difficult case,which was for deforestation in China.This is important, because in China in 1997,the Yellow River actually went dry for nine monthscausing severe loss of agriculture outputand pain and loss to society.Just a year later the Yangtze flooded,causing something like 5,500 deaths.So clearly there was a problem with deforestation.It was associated largely with the construction industry.And the Chinese government responded sensiblyand placed a ban on felling.A retrospective on 40 yearsshows that if we had accounted for these costs --the cost of loss of topsoil,the cost of loss of waterways,the lost productivity, the loss to local communitiesas a result of all these factors,desertification and so on --those costs are almost twice as muchas the market price of timber.So in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplaceought to have been three-times what it washad it reflected the true pain and the coststo the society within China.Of course, after the event one can be wise.The way to do this is to do it on a company basis,to take leadership forward,and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost,and to disclose these answers.Someone once asked me, "Who is better or worse,is it Unilever or is it P&amp;Gwhen it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?"And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies,good though they are and professional though they are,do not calculate or disclose their externalities.But if we look at companies like PUMA --Jochen Zeitz, their CEO and chairman,once challenged me at a function,saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it.Well I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it.He's basically worked the cost to PUMA.PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover,300 million dollars of profits,200 million dollars after tax,94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business.Now that's not a happy situation for them,but they have the confidence and the courageto come forward and say, "Here's what we are measuring.We are measuring it because we knowthat you cannot manage what you do not measure."That's an example, I think, for us to look atand for us to draw comfort from.If more companies did this,and if more sectors engaged this as sectors,you could have analysts, business analysts,and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOsactually look and compare the social performance of companies.Today we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out.This can be done.And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.has already set up a coalition to do this,an international coalition.The other favorite, if you like, solution for meis the creation of green carbon markets.And by the way, these are my favorites --externalities calculation and green carbon markets.TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutionsincluding protected area evaluationand payments for ecosystem servicesand eco-certification and you name it, but these are the favorites.What's green carbon?Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace.It's about energy emissions.The European Union ETS is the main marketplace.It's not doing too well. We've over-issued.A bit like inflation: you over-issue currency,you get what you see, declining prices.But that's all about energy and industry.But what we're missing is also some other emissionslike black carbon, that is soot.What we're also missing is blue carbon,which, by the way, is the largest store of carbon --more than 55 percent.Thankfully, the flux, in other words, the flow of emissionsfrom the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa,is more or less balanced.In fact, what's being absorbedis something like 25 percent of our emissions,which then leads to acidificationor lower alkalinity in oceans.More of that in a minute.And finally, there's deforestation,and there's emission of methanefrom agriculture.Green carbon,which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions,and blue carbontogether comprise 25 percent of our emissions.We have the means already in our hands,through a structure, through a mechanism, called REDD Plus --a scheme for the reduced emissionsfrom deforestation and forest degradation.And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars eachtowards Indonesia and Brazilto implement this Red Plus scheme.So we actually have some movement forward.But the thing is to do a lot more of that.Will this solve the problem? Will economics solve everything?Well I'm afraid not.There is an area that is the oceans, coral reefs.As you can see,they cut across the entire globeall the way from Micronesiaacross Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Madagascarand to the West of the Caribbean.These red dots, these red areas,basically provide the food and livelihoodfor more than half a billion people.So that's almost an eighth of society.And the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost --and scientists tell usthat any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per millionis too dangerous for the survival of these reefs --we are not only risking the extinctionof the entire coral species, the warm water corals,we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans,but we are risking the very lives and livelihoodsof more than 500 million peoplewho live in the developing world in poor countries.So in selecting targets of 450 parts per millionand selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations,what we have done is we've made an ethical choice.We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in societyto not have coral reefs.Well what I will say to you in partingis that we may have done that.Let's think about it and what it means,but please, let's not do more of that.Because mother nature only has that muchin ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital.I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices.Thank you.(Applause)

or, to my taste,new drugs for cancer.Boston is a bit of a candy store.The bar is called the Miracle of Science.The billboards say "Lab Space Available."that of genome medicine.than ever before.that's been so pressing for so many years:Why do I have cancer?affecting more than 10,000 genes,causes of cancer.Yet comparatively,And this inadequacy of cancer medicineWe didn't fly him to Boston.We didn't sequence his genome.It's three proteins: ras, myc, p53.yet there's no medicine I can prescribecaused by these three ...Horsemen of the Apocalypse that is cancer.There's no ras, no myc, no p53 drug.And you might fairly ask: Why is that?it's too hard.That for whatever reason,that's called the undruggable genome --or the Moon unwalkable.It's a horrible term of trade.But what it meansinto which we, like molecular locksmiths,what we had instead,were these substances:arsenic,thalidomide,And this is the 21st century.And so, I guess you'd say,I went back to school, in chemistry,of the open source,the crowd source,to our patients.but I'd like to tell you today a storycalled BRD4,called JQ1,which we affectionately named for Jun Qi,the chemist that made this molecule.Now, BRD4 is an interesting protein.how does it remember it's cancer?When it winds up its genome,divides into two cells and unwinds again,It remembers that it's cancer.places little molecular bookmarks,little Post-it notes,so-called bromodomains.So we developed an idea, a rationale,that perhaps if we made a moleculeby entering into the little pocketat the base of this spinning protein,then maybe we could convince cancer cells,that they're not cancer.And so we started to work on this problem.We developed libraries of compoundscalled JQ1.Now, not being a drug company,We just started mailing it to our friends.I have a small lab.We sent it to Oxford, England,for this protein target.or hand in glove.Now, this is a very rare cancer,this BRD4-addicted cancer.And so we worked with samples of materialwe observed something really striking.The cancer cells --small, round and rapidly dividing,grew these arms and extensions.They were changing shape.In effect,and becoming a normal cell.This got us very excited.who was very much at the end of lifewith this incurable cancer.And so we approached this patientand asked if he would collaborate with us.from this chest tubewell, that would be, of course, impossibleand, rightly, illegal to do in humans.And he obliged us.without ever touching plastic.The cancer is growingAnd as we treat it with our compound,this addiction to sugar,this rapid growth, faded.And on the animal on the right,you see that the cancer was responding.We've completed, now, clinical trialsin four mouse models of this disease.And every time, we see the same thing.and the ones that don't rapidly perish.So we started to wonder,until they turn the prototype druginto an active pharmaceutical substance.So we did just the opposite.at the earliest prototype stage.typically a secret in our discipline.We told people exactly how to make it.We gave them our email address,suggesting that if they write us,we'll send them a free molecule.(Laughter)for our lab as possible.And this was, unfortunately, successful.(Laughter)Because now, we've shared this molecule,just since December of last year,with 40 laboratories in the United Statesand 30 more in Europe --many of them pharmaceutical companies,seeking now to enter this space,about the use of this moleculeLeukemia cells treated with this compoundturn into normal white blood cells.Mice with multiple myeloma,respond dramaticallyto the treatment with this drug.You might know that fat has memory.I'll nicely demonstrate that for you.(Laughter)In fact, this moleculefrom remembering how to make fat,such that mice on a high-fat diet,(Laughter)fail to develop fatty liver,which is a major medical problem.What this research taught us --not just my lab, but our institute,for drug discovery;in a scientific waythan any other,never made one of its own.For all the reasons you see listed here,and creative disciplineof prototype drug discovery.So what next?It's not orally bioavailable.And everyone in the lab,based on this molecule.It's here where I'd sayyour collaborative participation.that we can deposit these molecules into.to work with competent, motivated,enthusiastic, hopefully well-funded peopleThis molecule will soon leave our benchesof drug discovery,I want to leave you with just two ideas.it's less the science than the strategy.This, for us, was a social experiment --as we could be?"This string of letters and numbersand symbols and parenthesesthat can be texted, I suppose,or Twittered worldwide,Yet this information is largely a secret.And so we seek, really, to downloadto patients with cancer.This research is funded by the public.It's funded by foundations.And one thing I've learned in Boston(Laughter)I've never seen, really, anywhere,this unique support for cancer research.And so I want to thank youfor your participation, your collaborationand most of all,for your confidence in our ideas.(Applause)

Well we all know the World Wide Webhas absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting,commerce and social connectivity,but where did it all come from?And I'll quote three people:Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee.So let's just run through these guys.This is Vannevar Bush.Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war.And in 1945,he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly.And the article was called "As We May Think."And what Vannevar Bush was sayingwas the way we use information is broken.We don't work in terms of librariesand catalog systems and so forth.The brain works by association.With one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.And the way information is structuredis totally incapable of keeping up with this process.And so he suggested a machine,and he called it the memex.And the memex would link information,one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth.Now this was in 1945.A computer in those dayswas something the secret services used to use for code breaking.And nobody knew anything about it.So this was before the computer was invented.And he proposed this machine called the memex.And he had a platform where you linked information to other information,and then you could call it up at will.So spinning forward,one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart,and he was a U.S. Air Force officer.And he was reading it in their library in the Far East.And he was so inspired by this article,it kind of directed the rest of his life.And by the mid-60s, he was able to put this into actionwhen he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California.He built a system.The system was designed to augment human intelligence, it was called.And in a premonition of today's worldof cloud computing and softwares of service,his system was called NLSfor oN-Line System.And this is Doug Engelbart.He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conferencein 1968.What he showed --he sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system.He had his head mic like I've got.And he works this system.And you can see, he's working between documentsand graphics and so forth.And he's driving it allwith this platform here,with a five-finger keyboardand the world's first computer mouse,which he specially designed in order to do this system.So this is where the mouse came from as well.So this is Doug Engelbart.The trouble with Doug Engelbart's systemwas that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.So for a personal computer,a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane;it wasn't really very practical.But spin on to the 80swhen personal computers did arrive,then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers.And my company, OWLbuilt a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh.And we delivered the world's first hypertext system.And this began to get a head of steam.Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard,and they made a bit of a fuss about it.They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched.The magazines started to cover it.Byte magazine and Communications at the ACMhad special issues covering hypertext.We developed a PC version of this productas well as the Macintosh version.And our PC version became quite mature.These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.You were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.We developed a system suchthat it had a markup language based on html.We called it hml: hypertext markup language.And the system was capable of doingvery, very large documentation systems over computer networks.So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Parisin late November 1990.And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Leewho said, "Are you Ian Ritchie?" and I said, "Yeah."And he said, "I need to talk to you."And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web.And I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name,especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office.But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Webwould take over the world one day.And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it,because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything;it was just plain text.I thought, well, you know, interesting,but a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this.So we didn't do it.In the next couple of years,the hypertext community didn't recognize him either.In 1992, his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference.In 1993,there was a table at the conference in Seattle,and a guy called Marc Andreessenwas demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.And I saw it, and I thought, yep, that's it.And the very next year, in 1994, we had the conference here in Edinburgh,and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker.So that puts me in pretty illustrious company.There was a guy called Dick Rowewho was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles.There was a guy called Gary Kildallwho went flying his planewhen IBM came looking for an operating systemfor the IBM PC,and he wasn't there, so they went back to see Bill Gates.And the 12 publisherswho turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess.On the other hand, there's Marc Andreessenwho wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web.And according to Fortune magazine,he's worth 700 million dollars.But is he happy?(Laughter)(Applause)

I'm a garbage man.And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man,because I absolutely hate waste.I hope, within the next 10 minutes,to change the way you thinkabout a lot of the stuff in your life.And I'd like to start at the very beginning.Think back when you were just a kid.How did look at the stuff in your life?Perhaps it was like these toddler rules:It's my stuff if I saw it first.The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.The more stuff that's mine, the better.And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.(Laughter)Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry,it's become pretty clear to methat we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behindas we develop into adults.And let me tell you why I have that perspective.Because each and every dayat our recycling plants around the worldwe handle about one million poundsof people's discarded stuff.Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff,but it's a tiny drop of the durable goodsthat are disposed each and every year around the world --well less than one percent.In fact, the United Nations estimatesthat there's about 85 billion pounds a yearof electronics wastethat gets discarded around the world each and every year --and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth,that number well more than doubles.And of course, the more developed the country,the bigger these mountains.Now when you see these mountains,most people think of garbage.We see above-ground mines.And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materialsthat went into making all of this stuff in the first place.And it's becoming increasingly importantthat we figure out how to extract these raw materialsfrom these extremely complicated waste streams.Because as we've heard all week at TED,the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in itwho want more and more stuff.And of course, they want the toys and the toolsthat many of us take for granted.And what goes into making those toys and toolsthat we use every single day?It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.And the metals, we typically getfrom ore that we minein ever widening minesand ever deepening mines around the world.And the plastics, we get from oil,which we go to more remote locationsand drill ever deeper wells to extract.And these practices havesignificant economic and environmental implicationsthat we're already starting to see today.The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuffand starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff,particularly in regions of the world like here in Europethat have recycling policies in placethat require that this stuff be recycledin a responsible manner.Most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff,if it makes it to a recycler, are the metals.To put that in perspective --and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals,because it's the most common metal --if your stuff makes it to a recycler,probably over 90 percent of the metalsare going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.Plastics are a whole other story:well less than 10 percent are recovered.In fact, it's more like five percent.Most of it's incinerated or landfilled.Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material,have very little value.But actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.And there's more plastics produced and consumedaround the world on a volume basisevery year than steel.So why is such a plentiful and valuable materialnot recovered at anywhere near the rateof the less valuable material?Well it's predominantly becausemetals are very easy to recyclefrom other materials and from one another.They have very different densities.They have different electrical and magnetic properties.And they even have different colors.So it's very easy for either humans or machinesto separate these metalsfrom one another and from other materials.Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.They have either identical or very similarelectrical and magnetic properties.And any plastic can be any color,as you probably well know.So the traditional ways of separating materialsjust simply don't work for plastics.Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humansis that a lot of our stuff from the developed world --and sadly to say, particularly from the United States,where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe --finds its way to developing countriesfor low-cost recycling.People, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff.They extract what they can, which is mostly the metals --circuit boards and so forth --and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover,which is, again, mostly the plastics.Or they burn the plastics to get to the metalsin burn houses like you see here.And they extract the metals by hand.Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution,this is certainly not the low-environmentalor human health-and-safety solution.I call this environmental arbitrage.And it's not fair, it's not safeand it's not sustainable.Now because the plastics are so plentiful --and by the way,those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously --but people do try to recover the plastics.This is just one example.This is a photo I took standing on the rooftopsof one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.They store the plastics on the roofs.They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these,and people try very hard to separate the plastics,by color, by shape, by feel,by any technique they can.And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" techniquewhere they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumesto try to determine the type of plastic.None of these techniques result in any amount of recyclingin any significant way.And by the way,please don't try this technique at home.So what are we to do about this space-age material,at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundantto keep putting back in the groundor certainly send up in smoke.So about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around,trying to figure out how to separatethese very similar materials from each other,and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends,in the mining world actually, and in the plastics world,and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.Because after all, we're doing above-ground mining.And we eventually broke the code.This is the last frontier of recycling.It's the last major materialto be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.And we finally figured out how to do it.And in the process, we started recreatinghow the plastics industry makes plastics.The traditional way to make plasticsis with oil or petrochemicals.You breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways,to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.We said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint,sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.Well a good place to start is with waste.It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil,and it's plentiful,as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.And because we're not breaking down the plastic into moleculesand recombining them,we're using a mining approach to extract the materials.We have significantly lower capital costsin our plant equipment.We have enormous energy savings.I don't know how many other projects on the planet right nowcan save 80 to 90 percent of the energycompared to making something the traditional way.And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollarsto build a chemical plantthat will only make one type of plastic for its entire life,our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.And we make a drop-in replacementfor that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.Our customers get to enjoyhuge CO2 savings.They get to close the loop with their products.And they get to make more sustainable products.In the short time period I have,I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.They recover the metalsand leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste --a very complex mixture of materials,but predominantly plastics.We take out the things that aren't plastics,such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber,wood, glass, paper, you name it.Even an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.And it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.We're sieving the material, we're using magnets,we're using air classification.It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point.At the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite:many different types of plasticsand many different grades of plastics.This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process,and the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.We use a very highly automated processto sort those plastics,not only by type, but by grade.And out the end of that part of the processcome little flakes of plastic:one type, one grade.We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.We push that material to extruders where we melt it,push it through small die holes,make spaghetti-like plastic strands.And we chop those strandsinto what are called pellets.And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.This is the same materialthat you would get from oil.And today,we're producing it from your old stuff,and it's going right back into your new stuff.(Applause)So now, instead of your stuff ending upon a hillside in a developing countryor literally going up in smoke,you can find your old stuffback on top of your desk in new products,in your office,or back at work in your home.And these are just a few examplesof companies that are buying our plastic,replacing virgin plastic,to make their new products.So I hope I've changed the way you look atat least some of the stuff in your life.We took our clues from mother nature.Mother nature wastes very little,reuses practically everything.And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer --that's a label I've always hated my entire life --and think of yourself as just using resources in one form,until they can be transformed to another formfor another use later in time.And finally, I hope you agree with meto change that last toddler rule just a little bitto: "If it's broken, it's my stuff."Thank you for your time.(Applause)

significant way.And by the way,please don't try this technique at home.So what are we to do about this space-age material,at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundantto keep putting back in the groundor certainly send up in smoke.So about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around,trying to figure out how to separatethese very similar materials from each other,and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends,in the mining world actually, and in the plastics world,and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.Because after all, we're doing above-ground mining.And we eventually broke the code.This is the last frontier of recycling.It's the last major materialto be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.And we finally figured out how to do it.And in the process, we started recreatinghow the plastics industry makes plastics.The traditional way to make plasticsis with oil or petrochemicals.You breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways,to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.We said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint,sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.Well a good place to start is with waste.It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil,and it's plentiful,as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.And because we're not breaking down the plastic into moleculesand recombining them,we're using a mining approach to extract the materials.We have significantly lower capital costsin our plant equipment.We have enormous energy savings.I don't know how many other projects on the planet right nowcan save 80 to 90 percent of the energycompared to making something the traditional way.And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollarsto build a chemical plantthat will only make one type of plastic for its entire life,our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.And we make a drop-in replacementfor that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.Our customers get to enjoyhuge CO2 savings.They get to close the loop with their products.And they get to make more sustainable products.In the short time period I have,I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.They recover the metalsand leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste --a very complex mixture of materials,but predominantly plastics.We take out the things that aren't plastics,such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber,wood, glass, paper, you name it.Even an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.And it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.We're sieving the material, we're using magnets,we're using air classification.It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point.At the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite:many different types of plasticsand many different grades of plastics.This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process,and the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.We use a very highly automated processto sort those plastics,not only by type, but by grade.And out the end of that part of the processcome little flakes of plastic:one type, one grade.We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.We push that material to extruders where we melt it,push it through small die holes,make spaghetti-like plastic strands.And we chop those strandsinto what are called pellets.And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.This is the same materialthat you would get from oil.And today,we're producing it from your old stuff,and it's going right back into your new stuff.(Applause)So now, instead of your stuff ending upon a hillside in a developing countryor literally going up in smoke,you can find your old stuffback on top of your desk in new products,in your office,or back at work in your home.And these are just a few examplesof companies that are buying our plastic,replacing virgin plastic,to make their new products.So I hope I've changed the way you look atat least some of the stuff in your life.We took our clues from mother nature.Mother nature wastes very little,reuses practically everything.And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer --that's a label I've always hated my entire life --and think of yourself as just using resources in one form,until they can be transformed to another formfor another use later in time.And finally, I hope you agree with meto change that last toddler rule just a little bitto: "If it's broken, it's my stuff."Thank you for your time.(Applause)

So I just want to tell you my story.I spend a lot of timeteaching adults how to use visual languageand doodling in the workplace.And naturally, I encounter a lot of resistance,because it's considered to be anti-intellectualand counter to serious learning.But I have a problem with that belief,because I know that doodling has a profound impacton the way that we can process informationand the way that we can solve problems.So I was curious about why there was a disconnectbetween the way our society perceives doodlingand the way that the reality is.So I discovered some very interesting things.For example, there's no such thingas a flattering definition of a doodle.In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool --as in Yankee Doodle.In the 18th century, it became a verb,and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone.In the 19th century, it was a corrupt politician.And today, we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition,at least to me, which is the following:To doodle officially meansto dawdle,to dilly dally, to monkey around,to make meaningless marks,to do something of little value, substance or import,and -- my personal favorite --to do nothing.No wonder people are averse to doodling at work.Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work;it's totally inappropriate.(Laughter)Additionally, I've heard horror storiesfrom people whose teachers scolded them, of course, for doodling in classrooms.And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom.There is a powerful cultural norm against doodlingin settings in which we are supposed to learn something.And unfortunately,the press tends to reinforce this normwhen they're reporting on a doodling scene --of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like --they typically use words like "discovered"or "caught" or "found out,"as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed.And additionally, there is a psychological aversion to doodling --thank you, Freud.In the 1930s, Freud told us allthat you could analyze people's psychesbased on their doodles.This is not accurate, but it did happen to Tony Blairat the Davos Forum in 2005,when his doodles were, of course, "discovered"and he was labeled the following things.Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle.(Laughter)And Bill, if you're here, nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal.But that does contributeto people not wanting to share their doodles.And here is the real deal. Here's what I believe.I think that our cultureis so intensely focused on verbal informationthat we're almost blinded to the value of doodling.And I'm not comfortable with that.And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst,I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth.And here's the truth:doodling is an incredibly powerful tool,and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn.So here's a new definition for doodling.And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary,because I want to talk to you later.Here's the real definition:Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think.That is why millions of people doodle.Here's another interesting truth about the doodle:People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal informationretain more of that informationthan their non-doodling counterparts.We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus,but in reality, it is a preemptive measureto stop you from losing focus.Additionally, it has a profound effecton creative problem-solvingand deep information processing.There are four ways that learners intake informationso that they can make decisions.They are visual, auditory,reading and writing and kinesthetic.Now in order for us to really chew on informationand do something with it,we have to engage at least two of those modalities,or we have to engage one of those modalitiescoupled with an emotional experience.The incredible contribution of the doodleis that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneouslywith the possibility of an emotional experience.That is a pretty solid contributionfor a behavior equated with doing nothing.This is so nerdy,but this made me cry when I discovered this.So they did anthropological researchinto the unfolding of artistic activity in children,and they found that, across space and time,all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logicas they grow.In other words, they have a shared and growingcomplexity in visual languagethat happens in a predictable order.And I think that is incredible.I think that means doodling is native to usand we simply are denying ourselves that instinct.And finally, a lot a people aren't privy to this,but the doodle is a precursorto some of our greatest cultural assets.This is but one:this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi.So here is my point:Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicatedfrom a classroom or a boardroomor even the war room.On the contrary,doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situationswhere information density is very highand the need for processing that information is very high.And I will go you one further.Because doodling is so universally accessibleand it is not intimidating as an art form,it can be leveraged as a portalthrough which we move peopleinto higher levels of visual literacy.My friends, the doodle has never beenthe nemesis of intellectual thought.In reality, it is one of its greatest allies.Thank you.(Applause)

I am a reformed marketer,and I now work in international development.In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo,which is the [second] largest country in Africa.In fact, it's as large as Western Europe,but it only has 300 miles of paved roads.The DRC is a dangerous place.In the past 10 years, five million people have dieddue to a war in the east.But war isn't the only reasonthat life is difficult in the DRC.There are many health issues as well.In fact, the HIV prevalence rateis 1.3 percent among adults.This might not sound like a large number,but in a country with 76 million people,it means there are 930,000 that are infected.And due to the poor infrastructure,only 25 percent of thoseare receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.Which is why, in part,donor agencies provide condomsat low or no cost.And so while I was in the DRC,I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms,including Damien.Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.It's a hotel that's only open until midnight,so it's not a place that you stay.But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.Now Damien knows all about condoms,but he doesn't sell them.He said there's just not in demand.It's not surprising,because only three percent of people in the DRCuse condoms.Joseph and Christine,who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms,said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost,and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them,their customers don't buy the branded versions.They like the generics.And as a marketer, I found that curious.And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.And it turns out that there are three main messagesused by the donor agencies for these condoms:fear, financing and fidelity.They name the condoms things like Vive, "to live"or Trust.They package it with the red ribbonthat reminds us of HIV,put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them,show pictures of your wife or husbandand tell you to protect themor to act prudently.Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking aboutjust before they go get a condom.(Laughter)What is it that you think aboutjust before you get a condom?Sex!And the private companies that sell condoms in these places,they understand this.Their marketing is slightly different.The name might not be much different,but the imagery sure is.Some brands are aspirational,and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative.And this made me thinkthat perhaps the donor agencies had just missed outon a key aspect of marketing:understanding who's the audience.And for donor agencies, unfortunately,the audience tends to bepeople that aren't even in the country they're working [in].It's people back home,people that support their work,people like these.But if what we're really trying to dois stop the spread of HIV,we need to think about the customer,the people whose behavior needs to change --the couples,the young women, the young men --whose lives depend on it.And so the lesson is this:it doesn't really matter what you're selling;you just have to think about who is your customer,and what are the messagesthat are going to get them to change their behavior.It might just save their lives.Thank you.(Applause)

Let's talk about billions.Let's talk aboutpast and future billions.We knowthat about 106 billion peoplehave ever lived.And we know that most of them are dead.And we also knowthat most of them live or lived in Asia.And we also knowthat most of them were or are very poor --did not live for very long.Let's talk about billions.Let's talk aboutthe 195,000 billion dollars of wealthin the world today.We know that most of that wealthwas made after the year 1800.And we know that most of itis currently ownedby people we might call Westerners:Europeans, North Americans, Australasians.19 percent of the world's population today,Westerners own two-thirds of its wealth.Economic historianscall this "The Great Divergence."And this slide hereis the best simplificationof the Great Divergence storyI can offer you.It's basically two ratiosof per capita GDP,per capita gross domestic product,so average income.One, the red line,is the ratio of British to Indianper capita income.And the blue lineis the ratio of American to Chinese.And this chart goes back to 1500.And you can see herethat there's an exponential Great Divergence.They start off pretty close together.In fact, in 1500,the average Chinese was richer than the average North American.When you get to the 1970s,which is where this chart ends,the average Briton is more than 10 times richerthan the average Indian.And that's allowingfor differences in the cost of living.It's based on purchasing power parity.The average Americanis nearly 20 times richerthan the average Chineseby the 1970s.So why?This wasn't just an economic story.If you take the 10 countriesthat went on to becomethe Western empires,in 1500 they were really quite tiny --five percent of the world's land surface,16 percent of its population,maybe 20 percent of its income.By 1913,these 10 countries, plus the United States,controlled vast global empires --58 percent of the world's territory,about the same percentage of its population,and a really huge, nearly three-quarters shareof global economic output.And notice, most of that went to the motherland,to the imperial metropoles,not to their colonial possessions.Now you can't just blame this on imperialism --though many people have tried to do so --for two reasons.One, empire was the least original thingthat the West did after 1500.Everybody did empire.They beat preexisting Oriental empireslike the Mughals and the Ottomans.So it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanationfor the Great Divergence.In any case, as you may remember,the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s,some considerable time after decolonization.This is not a new question.Samuel Johnson,the great lexicographer,[posed] it through his character Rasselasin his novel "Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia,"published in 1759."By what means are the Europeans thus powerful;or why, since they can so easily visit Asia and Africafor trade or conquest,cannot the Asiaticks and Africansinvade their coasts,plant colonies in their ports,and give laws to their natural princes?The same wind that carries them backwould bring us thither?"That's a great question.And you know what,it was also being asked at roughly the same timeby the Resterners -- by the people in the rest of the world --like Ibrahim Muteferrika,an Ottoman official,the man who introduced printing, very belatedly,to the Ottoman Empire --who said in a book published in 1731,"Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the pastcompared with Muslim nationsbegin to dominate so many lands in modern timesand even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies?"Unlike Rasselas,Muteferrika had an answer to that question,which was correct.He said it was "because they have laws and rulesinvented by reason."It's not geography.You may think we can explain the Great Divergencein terms of geography.We know that's wrong,because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th centuryto see if geography mattered more than institutions.We took all the Germans,we divided them roughly in two,and we gave the ones in the East communism,and you see the result.Within an incredibly short period of time,people living in the German Democratic Republicproduced Trabants, the Trabbi,one of the world's worst ever cars,while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz.If you still don't believe me,we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula.And we decided we'd take Koreansin roughly the same geographical placewith, notice, the same basic traditional culture,and we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism.And the result is an even bigger divergencein a very short space of timethan happened in Germany.Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly,but in almost every other respect,it's a huge divergence.Which leads me to thinkthat neither geography nor national character,popular explanations for this kind of thing,are really significant.It's the ideas.It's the institutions.This must be truebecause a Scotsman said it.And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED.So let me just explain to youthat the smartest man ever was a Scotsman.He was Adam Smith --not Billy Connolly, not Sean Connery --though he is very smart indeed.(Laughter)Smith -- and I want you to goand bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile;it's a wonderful statue --Smith, in the "Wealth of Nations"published in 1776 --that's the most important thing that happened that year ...(Laughter)You bet.There was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies, but ...(Laughter)"China seems to have been long stationary,and probably long ago acquired that full complement of richeswhich is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions.But this complement may be much inferiorto what, with other laws and institutions,the nature of its soil, climate, and situationmight admit of."That is so right and so cool.And he said it such a long time ago.But you know, this is a TED audience,and if I keep talking about institutions,you're going to turn off.So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand.Let's call them the killer apps.I want to explain to you that there were six killer appsthat set the West apart from the rest.And they're kind of like the apps on your phone,in the sense that they look quite simple.They're just icons; you click on them.But behind the icon, there's complex code.It's the same with institutions.There are sixwhich I think explain the Great Divergence.One, competition.Two, the scientific revolution.Three, property rights.Four, modern medicine.Five, the consumer society.And six, the work ethic.You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at,or try and boil it down to just four,but you'll lose.(Laughter)Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this,synthesizing the work of many economic historiansin the process.Competition means,not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500,but within each of these units,there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns.The ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation,existed in the 12th century.Nothing like this existed in China,where there was one monolithic statecovering a fifth of humanity,and anyone with any ambitionhad to pass one standardized examination,which took three days and was very difficultand involved memorizing vast numbers of charactersand very complex Confucian essay writing.The scientific revolution was differentfrom the science that had been achieved in the Oriental worldin a number of crucial ways,the most important beingthat, through the experimental method,it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before.Example: Benjamin Robins's extraordinary applicationof Newtonian physics to ballistics.Once you do that,your artillery becomes accurate.Think of what that means.That really was a killer application.(Laughter)Meanwhile, there's no scientific revolution anywhere else.The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe,but there's no scientific revolution there.In fact, they demolish Taqi al-Din's observatory,because it's considered blasphemousto inquire into the mind of God.Property rights: It's not the democracy, folks;it's having the rule of law based on private property rights.That's what makes the differencebetween North America and South America.You could turn up in North Americahaving signed a deed of indenturesaying, "I'll work for nothing for five years.You just have to feed me."But at the end of it, you've got a hundred acres of land.That's the land granton the bottom half of the slide.That's not possible in Latin Americawhere land is held ontoby a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors.And you can see here the huge divergencethat happens in property ownership between North and South.Most people in rural North Americaowned some land by 1900.Hardly anyone in South America did.That's another killer app.Modern medicine in the late 19th centurybegan to make major breakthroughsagainst the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people.And this was another killer app --the very opposite of a killer,because it doubled, and then more than doubled, human life expectancy.It even did thatin the European empires.Even in places like Senegal,beginning in the early 20th century,there were major breakthroughs in public health,and life expectancy began to rise.It doesn't rise any fasterafter these countries become independent.The empires weren't all bad.The consumer society is what you needfor the Industrial Revolution to have a point.You need people to want to wear tons of clothes.You've all bought an article of clothing in the last month;I guarantee it.That's the consumer society,and it propels economic growthmore than even technological change itself.Japan was the first non-Western societyto embrace it.The alternative,which was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi,was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent.Very few Indians todaywish that India had gone downMahatma Gandhi's road.Finally, the work ethic.Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant.He was wrong.Any culture can get the work ethicif the institutions are thereto create the incentive to work.We know thisbecause today the work ethicis no longer a Protestant, Western phenomenon.In fact, the West has lost its work ethic.Today, the average Koreanworks a thousand hours more a yearthan the average German --a thousand.And this is partof a really extraordinary phenomenon,and that is the end of the Great Divergence.Who's got the work ethic now?Take a look at mathematical attainmentby 15 year-olds.At the top of the international league tableaccording to the latest PISA study,is the Shanghai district of China.The gap between Shanghaiand the United Kingdom and the United Statesis as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S.and Albania and Tunisia.You probably assumethat because the iPhone was designed in Californiabut assembled in Chinathat the West still leads in terms of technological innovation.You're wrong.In terms of patents,there's no question that the East is ahead.Not only has Japan been ahead for some time,South Korea has gone into third place,and China is just about to overtake Germany.Why?Because the killer apps can be downloaded.It's open source.Any society can adopt these institutions,and when they do,they achieve what the West achieved after 1500 --only faster.This is the Great Reconvergence,and it's the biggest story of your lifetime.Because it's on your watch that this is happening.It's our generationthat is witnessing the end of Western predominance.The average American used to be more than 20 times richerthan the average Chinese.Now it's just five times,and soon it will be 2.5 times.So I want to end with three questionsfor the future billions,just ahead of 2016,when the United States will lose its placeas number one economy to China.The first is, can you delete these apps,and are we in the process of doing soin the Western world?The second question is,does the sequencing of the download matter?And could Africa get that sequencing wrong?One obvious implication of modern economic historyis that it's quite hard to transition to democracybefore you've establishedsecure private property rights.Warning: that may not work.And third, can China do withoutkiller app number three?That's the one that John Locke systematizedwhen he said that freedom was rooted in private property rightsand the protection of law.That's the basisfor the Western modelof representative government.Now this picture shows the demolitionof the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studioin Shanghai earlier this year.He's now free again,having been detained, as you know, for some time.But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt.Winston Churchill once defined civilizationin a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938.And I think these words really nail it:"It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians.It means that violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs,the conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny,give place to parliaments where laws are made,and independent courts of justicein which over long periods those laws are maintained.That is civilization --and in its soil grow continuallyfreedom, comfort and culture,"what all TEDsters care about most."When civilization reigns in any country,a wider and less harassed lifeis afforded to the masses of the people."That's so true.I don't think the decline of Western civilizationis inevitable,because I don't think history operatesin this kind of life-cycle model,beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's"Course of Empire" paintings.That's not the way history works.That's not the way the West rose,and I don't think it's the way the West will fall.The West may collapse very suddenly.Complex civilizations do that,because they operate, most of the time,on the edge of chaos.That's one of the most profound insightsto come out of the historical study of complex institutionslike civilizations.No, we may hang on,despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated,despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethicand other parts of our historical mojo.But one thing is for sure,the Great Divergenceis over, folks.Thanks very much.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Niall,I am just curiousabout your take on the other region of the world that's booming,which is Latin America.What's your view on that?Niall Ferguson: Well I really am not just talkingabout the rise of the East;I'm talking about the rise of the Rest,and that includes South America.I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard,"Hey, is South America part of the West?"He was an expert in Latin American history.He said, "I don't know; I'll have to think about that."That tells you something really important.I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular,but also Chile,which was in many ways the one that led the wayin transforming the institutions of economic life,there's a very bright future indeed.So my story really isas much about that convergence in the Americasas it's a convergence story in Eurasia.BG: And there is this impressionthat North America and Europeare not really paying attentionto these trends.Mostly they're worried about each other.The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow.The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow.And that's all we seem to be caring about recently.NF: I think the fiscal crisisthat we see in the developed World right now -- both sides of the Atlantic --is essentially the same thingtaking different formsin terms of political culture.And it's a crisis that has its structural facet --it's partly to do with demographics.But it's also, of course, to do with the massive crisisthat followed excessive leverage,excessive borrowing in the private sector.That crisis,which has been the focus of so much attention, including by me,I think is an epiphenomenon.The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon,which has just acceleratedthis huge shift,which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy.I think that's its real importance.BG: Niall, thank you. (NF: Thank you very much, Bruno.)(Applause)

Republicproduced Trabants, the Trabbi,one of the world's worst ever cars,while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz.If you still don't believe me,we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula.And we decided we'd take Koreansin roughly the same geographical placewith, notice, the same basic traditional culture,and we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism.And the result is an even bigger divergencein a very short space of timethan happened in Germany.Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly,but in almost every other respect,it's a huge divergence.Which leads me to thinkthat neither geography nor national character,popular explanations for this kind of thing,are really significant.It's the ideas.It's the institutions.This must be truebecause a Scotsman said it.And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED.So let me just explain to youthat the smartest man ever was a Scotsman.He was Adam Smith --not Billy Connolly, not Sean Connery --though he is very smart indeed.(Laughter)Smith -- and I want you to goand bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile;it's a wonderful statue --Smith, in the "Wealth of Nations"published in 1776 --that's the most important thing that happened that year ...(Laughter)You bet.There was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies, but ...(Laughter)"China seems to have been long stationary,and probably long ago acquired that full complement of richeswhich is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions.But this complement may be much inferiorto what, with other laws and institutions,the nature of its soil, climate, and situationmight admit of."That is so right and so cool.And he said it such a long time ago.But you know, this is a TED audience,and if I keep talking about institutions,you're going to turn off.So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand.Let's call them the killer apps.I want to explain to you that there were six killer appsthat set the West apart from the rest.And they're kind of like the apps on your phone,in the sense that they look quite simple.They're just icons; you click on them.But behind the icon, there's complex code.It's the same with institutions.There are sixwhich I think explain the Great Divergence.One, competition.Two, the scientific revolution.Three, property rights.Four, modern medicine.Five, the consumer society.And six, the work ethic.You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at,or try and boil it down to just four,but you'll lose.(Laughter)Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this,synthesizing the work of many economic historiansin the process.Competition means,not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500,but within each of these units,there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns.The ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation,existed in the 12th century.Nothing like this existed in China,where there was one monolithic statecovering a fifth of humanity,and anyone with any ambitionhad to pass one standardized examination,which took three days and was very difficultand involved memorizing vast numbers of charactersand very complex Confucian essay writing.The scientific revolution was differentfrom the science that had been achieved in the Oriental worldin a number of crucial ways,the most important beingthat, through the experimental method,it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before.Example: Benjamin Robins's extraordinary applicationof Newtonian physics to ballistics.Once you do that,your artillery becomes accurate.Think of what that means.That really was a killer application.(Laughter)Meanwhile, there's no scientific revolution anywhere else.The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe,but there's no scientific revolution there.In fact, they demolish Taqi al-Din's observatory,because it's considered blasphemousto inquire into the mind of God.Property rights: It's not the democracy, folks;it's having the rule of law based on private property rights.That's what makes the differencebetween North America and South America.You could turn up in North Americahaving signed a deed of indenturesaying, "I'll work for nothing for five years.You just have to feed me."But at the end of it, you've got a hundred acres of land.That's the land granton the bottom half of the slide.That's not possible in Latin Americawhere land is held ontoby a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors.And you can see here the huge divergencethat happens in property ownership between North and South.Most people in rural North Americaowned some land by 1900.Hardly anyone in South America did.That's another killer app.Modern medicine in the late 19th centurybegan to make major breakthroughsagainst the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people.And this was another killer app --the very opposite of a killer,because it doubled, and then more than doubled, human life expectancy.It even did thatin the European empires.Even in places like Senegal,beginning in the early 20th century,there were major breakthroughs in public health,and life expectancy began to rise.It doesn't rise any fasterafter these countries become independent.The empires weren't all bad.The consumer society is what you needfor the Industrial Revolution to have a point.You need people to want to wear tons of clothes.You've all bought an article of clothing in the last month;I guarantee it.That's the consumer society,and it propels economic growthmore than even technological change itself.Japan was the first non-Western societyto embrace it.The alternative,which was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi,was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent.Very few Indians todaywish that India had gone downMahatma Gandhi's road.Finally, the work ethic.Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant.He was wrong.Any culture can get the work ethicif the institutions are thereto create the incentive to work.We know thisbecause today the work ethicis no longer a Protestant, Western phenomenon.In fact, the West has lost its work ethic.Today, the average Koreanworks a thousand hours more a yearthan the average German --a thousand.And this is partof a really extraordinary phenomenon,and that is the end of the Great Divergence.Who's got the work ethic now?Take a look at mathematical attainmentby 15 year-olds.At the top of the international league tableaccording to the latest PISA study,is the Shanghai district of China.The gap between Shanghaiand the United Kingdom and the United Statesis as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S.and Albania and Tunisia.You probably assumethat because the iPhone was designed in Californiabut assembled in Chinathat the West still leads in terms of technological innovation.You're wrong.In terms of patents,there's no question that the East is ahead.Not only has Japan been ahead for some time,South Korea has gone into third place,and China is just about to overtake Germany.Why?Because the killer apps can be downloaded.It's open source.Any society can adopt these institutions,and when they do,they achieve what the West achieved after 1500 --only faster.This is the Great Reconvergence,and it's the biggest story of your lifetime.Because it's on your watch that this is happening.It's our generationthat is witnessing the end of Western predominance.The average American used to be more than 20 times richerthan the average Chinese.Now it's just five times,and soon it will be 2.5 times.So I want to end with three questionsfor the future billions,just ahead of 2016,when the United States will lose its placeas number one economy to China.The first is, can you delete these apps,and are we in the process of doing soin the Western world?The second question is,does the sequencing of the download matter?And could Africa get that sequencing wrong?One obvious implication of modern economic historyis that it's quite hard to transition to democracybefore you've establishedsecure private property rights.Warning: that may not work.And third, can China do withoutkiller app number three?That's the one that John Locke systematizedwhen he said that freedom was rooted in private property rightsand the protection of law.That's the basisfor the Western modelof representative government.Now this picture shows the demolitionof the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studioin Shanghai earlier this year.He's now free again,having been detained, as you know, for some time.But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt.Winston Churchill once defined civilizationin a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938.And I think these words really nail it:"It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians.It means that violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs,the conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny,give place to parliaments where laws are made,and independent courts of justicein which over long periods those laws are maintained.That is civilization --and in its soil grow continuallyfreedom, comfort and culture,"what all TEDsters care about most."When civilization reigns in any country,a wider and less harassed lifeis afforded to the masses of the people."That's so true.I don't think the decline of Western civilizationis inevitable,because I don't think history operatesin this kind of life-cycle model,beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's"Course of Empire" paintings.That's not the way history works.That's not the way the West rose,and I don't think it's the way the West will fall.The West may collapse very suddenly.Complex civilizations do that,because they operate, most of the time,on the edge of chaos.That's one of the most profound insightsto come out of the historical study of complex institutionslike civilizations.No, we may hang on,despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated,despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethicand other parts of our historical mojo.But one thing is for sure,the Great Divergenceis over, folks.Thanks very much.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Niall,I am just curiousabout your take on the other region of the world that's booming,which is Latin America.What's your view on that?Niall Ferguson: Well I really am not just talkingabout the rise of the East;I'm talking about the rise of the Rest,and that includes South America.I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard,"Hey, is South America part of the West?"He was an expert in Latin American history.He said, "I don't know; I'll have to think about that."That tells you something really important.I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular,but also Chile,which was in many ways the one that led the wayin transforming the institutions of economic life,there's a very bright future indeed.So my story really isas much about that convergence in the Americasas it's a convergence story in Eurasia.BG: And there is this impressionthat North America and Europeare not really paying attentionto these trends.Mostly they're worried about each other.The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow.The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow.And that's all we seem to be caring about recently.NF: I think the fiscal crisisthat we see in the developed World right now -- both sides of the Atlantic --is essentially the same thingtaking different formsin terms of political culture.And it's a crisis that has its structural facet --it's partly to do with demographics.But it's also, of course, to do with the massive crisisthat followed excessive leverage,excessive borrowing in the private sector.That crisis,which has been the focus of so much attention, including by me,I think is an epiphenomenon.The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon,which has just acceleratedthis huge shift,which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy.I think that's its real importance.BG: Niall, thank you. (NF: Thank you very much, Bruno.)(Applause)

Cities are the crucible of civilization.They have been expanding,urbanization has been expanding,at an exponential rate in the last 200 yearsso that by the second part of this century,the planet will be completely dominatedby cities.Cities are the origins of global warming,impact on the environment,health, pollution, disease,finance,economies, energy --they're all problemsthat are confronted by having cities.That's where all these problems come from.And the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facingin terms of sustainability questionsare actually a reflectionof the exponential increasein urbanization across the planet.Here's some numbers.Two hundred years ago, the United Stateswas less than a few percent urbanized.It's now more than 82 percent.The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.China's building 300 new citiesin the next 20 years.Now listen to this:Every week for the foreseeable future,until 2050,every week more than a million peopleare being added to our cities.This is going to affect everything.Everybody in this room, if you stay alive,is going to be affectedby what's happening in citiesin this extraordinary phenomenon.However, cities,despite having this negative aspect to them,are also the solution.Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnetsthat have sucked up creative people,creating ideas, innovation,wealth and so on.So we have this kind of dual nature.And so there's an urgent needfor a scientific theory of cities.Now these are my comrades in arms.This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people,and they've done all the work,and I'm the great bullshitterthat tries to bring it all together.(Laughter)So here's the problem: This is what we all want.The 10 billion people on the planet in 2050want to live in places like this,having things like this,doing things like this,with economies that are growing like this,not realizing that entropyproduces things like this,this, thisand this.And the question is:Is that what Edinburgh and London and New Yorkare going to look like in 2050,or is it going to be this?That's the question.I must say, many of the indicatorslook like this is what it's going to look like,but let's talk about it.So my provocative statementis that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.And scientific theory means quantifiable --relying on underlying generic principlesthat can be made into a predictive framework.That's the quest.Is that conceivable?Are there universal laws?So here's two questionsthat I have in my head when I think about this problem.The first is:Are cities part of biology?Is London a great big whale?Is Edinburgh a horse?Is Microsoft a great big anthill?What do we learn from that?We use them metaphorically --the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on --is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit,or is there serious substance to it?And if that is the case,how come that it's very hard to kill a city?You could drop an atom bomb on a city,and 30 years later it's surviving.Very few cities fail.All companies die, all companies.And if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predictwhen Google is going to go bust.So is that just another versionof this?Well we understand this very well.That is, you ask any generic question about this --how many trees of a given size,how many branches of a given size does a tree have,how many leaves,what is the energy flowing through each branch,what is the size of the canopy,what is its growth, what is its mortality?We have a mathematical frameworkbased on generic universal principlesthat can answer those questions.And the idea is can we do the same for this?So the route in is recognizingone of the most extraordinary things about life,is that it is scalable,it works over an extraordinary range.This is just a tiny range actually:It's us mammals;we're one of these.The same principles, the same dynamics,the same organization is at workin all of these, including us,and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.And that is one of the main reasonslife is so resilient and robust --scalability.We're going to discuss that in a moment more.But you know, at a local level,you scale; everybody in this room is scaled.That's called growth.Here's how you grew.Rat, that's a rat -- could have been you.We're all pretty much the same.And you see, you're very familiar with this.You grow very quickly and then you stop.And that line thereis a prediction from the same theory,based on the same principles,that describes that forest.And here it is for the growth of a rat,and those points on there are data points.This is just the weight versus the age.And you see, it stops growing.Very, very good for biology --also one of the reasons for its great resilience.Very, very badfor economies and companies and citiesin our present paradigm.This is what we believe.This is what our whole economyis thrusting upon us,particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner:hockey sticks.This is a bunch of software companies --and what it is is their revenue versus their age --all zooming away,and everybody making millions and billions of dollars.Okay, so how do we understand this?So let's first talk about biology.This is explicitly showing youhow things scale,and this is a truly remarkable graph.What is plotted here is metabolic rate --how much energy you need per day to stay alive --versus your weight, your mass,for all of us bunch of organisms.And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10,otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph.And what you see if you plot itin this slightly curious wayis that everybody lies on the same line.Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse systemin the universe,there's an extraordinary simplicitybeing expressed by this.It's particularly astonishingbecause each one of these organisms,each subsystem, each cell type, each gene,has evolved in its own unique environmental nichewith its own unique history.And yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolutionand natural selection,they've been constrained to lie on a line.Something else is going on.Before I talk about that,I've written down at the bottom therethe slope of this curve, this straight line.It's three-quarters, roughly,which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear.And here's the point of that.It says that, if it were linear,the steepest slope,then doubling the sizeyou would require double the amount of energy.But it's sublinear, and what that translates intois that, if you double the size of the organism,you actually only need 75 percent more energy.So a wonderful thing about all of biologyis that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale.The bigger you are systematically,according to very well-defined rules,less energy per capita.Now any physiological variable you can think of,any life history event you can think of,if you plot it this way, looks like this.There is an extraordinary regularity.So you tell me the size of a mammal,I can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about itin terms of its physiology, life history, etc.And the reason for this is because of networks.All of life is controlled by networks --from the intracellular through the multicellularthrough the ecosystem level.And you're very familiar with these networks.That's a little thing that lives inside an elephant.And here's the summary of what I'm saying.If you take those networks,this idea of networks,and you apply universal principles,mathematizable, universal principles,all of these scalingsand all of these constraints follow,including the description of the forest,the description of your circulatory system,the description within cells.One of the things I did not stress in that introductionwas that, systematically, the pace of lifedecreases as you get bigger.Heart rates are slower; you live longer;diffusion of oxygen and resourcesacross membranes is slower, etc.The question is: Is any of this truefor cities and companies?So is London a scaled up Birmingham,which is a scaled up Brighton, etc., etc.?Is New York a scaled up San Francisco,which is a scaled up Santa Fe?Don't know. We will discuss that.But they are networks,and the most important network of citiesis you.Cities are just a physical manifestationof your interactions,our interactions,and the clustering and grouping of individuals.Here's just a symbolic picture of that.And here's scaling of cities.This shows that in this very simple example,which happens to be a mundane exampleof number of petrol stationsas a function of size --plotted in the same way as the biology --you see exactly the same kind of thing.There is a scaling.That is that the number of petrol stations in the cityis now given to youwhen you tell me its size.The slope of that is less than linear.There is an economy of scale.Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising.But here's what's surprising.It scales in the same way everywhere.This is just European countries,but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia,always the samewith the same kind of economy of scaleto the same degree.And any infrastructure you look at --whether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines --anything you look athas the same economy of scale scaling in the same way.It's an integrated systemthat has evolved despite all the planning and so on.But even more surprisingis if you look at socio-economic quantities,quantities that have no analog in biology,that have evolved when we started forming communitieseight to 10,000 years ago.The top one is wages as a function of sizeplotted in the same way.And the bottom one is you lot --super-creatives plotted in the same way.And what you seeis a scaling phenomenon.But most important in this,the exponent, the analog to that three-quartersfor the metabolic rate,is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2.Here it is,which says that the bigger you arethe more you have per capita, unlike biology --higher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger,more patents per capita, more crime per capita.And we've looked at everything:more AIDS cases, flu, etc.And here, they're all plotted together.Just to show you what we plotted,here is income, GDP --GDP of the city --crime and patents all on one graph.And you can see, they all follow the same line.And here's the statement.If you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000,from a million to two million, 10 to 20 million,it doesn't matter,then systematicallyyou get a 15 percent increasein wages, wealth, number of AIDS cases,number of police,anything you can think of.It goes up by 15 percent,and you have a 15 percent savingson the infrastructure.This, no doubt, is the reasonwhy a million people a week are gathering in cities.Because they think that all those wonderful things --like creative people, wealth, income --is what attracts them,forgetting about the ugly and the bad.What is the reason for this?Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics,but underlying this is the social networks,because this is a universal phenomenon.This 15 percent ruleis trueno matter where you are on the planet --Japan, Chile,Portugal, Scotland, doesn't matter.Always, all the data shows it's the same,despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.Something universal is going on.The universality, to repeat, is us --that we are the city.And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions.So there it is, I've said it again.So if it is those networks and their mathematical structure,unlike biology, which had sublinear scaling,economies of scale,you had the slowing of the pace of lifeas you get bigger.If it's social networks with super-linear scaling --more per capita --then the theory saysthat you increase the pace of life.The bigger you are, life gets faster.On the left is the heart rate showing biology.On the right is the speed of walkingin a bunch of European cities,showing that increase.Lastly, I want to talk about growth.This is what we had in biology, just to repeat.Economies of scalegave rise to this sigmoidal behavior.You grow fast and then stop --part of our resilience.That would be bad for economies and cities.And indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theoryis that if you have super-linear scalingfrom wealth creation and innovation,then indeed you get, from the same theory,a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely.And in fact, if you compare it to data,it fits very wellwith the development of cities and economies.But it has a terrible catch,and the catchis that this system is destined to collapse.And it's destined to collapse for many reasons --kind of Malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources.And how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before.What we do is,as we grow and we approach the collapse,a major innovation takes placeand we start over again,and we start over again as we approach the next one, and so on.So there's this continuous cycle of innovationthat is necessaryin order to sustain growth and avoid collapse.The catch, however, to thisis that you have to innovatefaster and faster and faster.So the imageis that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster,but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster.We have to accelerate on a continuous basis.And the question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings,avoid a heart attack?So lastly, I'm going to finish up in this last minute or twoasking about companies.See companies, they scale.The top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right.It's the same plot.This happens to be income and assetsversus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees.We could use sales, anything you like.There it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning,when companies are innovating,they scale beautifully.And we've looked at 23,000 companiesin the United States, may I say.And I'm only showing you a little bit of this.What is astonishing about companiesis that they scale sublinearlylike biology,indicating that they're dominated,not by super-linearinnovation and ideas;they become dominatedby economies of scale.In that interpretation,by bureaucracy and administration,and they do it beautifully, may I say.So if you tell me the size of some company, some small company,I could have predicted the size of Walmart.If it has this sublinear scaling,the theory sayswe should have sigmoidal growth.There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal.That's what we like, hockey sticks.But you notice, I've cheated,because I've only gone up to '94.Let's go up to 2008.That red line is from the theory.So if I'd have done this in 1994,I could have predicted what Walmart would be now.And then this is repeatedacross the entire spectrum of companies.There they are. That's 23,000 companies.They all start looking like hockey sticks,they all bend over,and they all die like you and me.Thank you.(Applause)

It's the Second World War.A German prison camp.And this man,Archie Cochrane,is a prisoner of war and a doctor,and he has a problem.The problem is that the men under his careare sufferingfrom an excruciating and debilitating conditionthat Archie doesn't really understand.The symptomsare this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin.But he doesn't know whether it's an infection, whether it's to do with malnutrition.He doesn't know how to cure it.And he's operating in a hostile environment.And people do terrible things in wars.The German camp guards, they've got bored.They've taken to just firing into the prison camp at randomfor fun.On one particular occasion,one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners' lavatorywhile it was full of prisoners.He said he heard suspicious laughter.And Archie Cochrane, as the camp doctor,was one of the first men into clear up the mess.And one more thing:Archie was suffering from this illness himself.So the situation seemed pretty desperate.But Archie Cochranewas a resourceful person.He'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp,and now he managedto get hold of supplies of marmiteon the black market.Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is.Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British.It looks like crude oil.It tastes ...zesty.And importantly,it's a rich sourceof vitamin B12.So Archie splits the men under his care as best he caninto two equal groups.He gives half of them vitamin C.He gives half of them vitamin B12.He very carefully and meticulously notes his resultsin an exercise book.And after just a few days,it becomes clearthat whatever is causing this illness,marmite is the cure.So Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp.Now you've got to imagine at the moment --forget this photo, imagine this guywith this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair.He hasn't been able to shave -- a sort of Billy Connolly figure.Cochrane, he starts ranting at these Germansin this Scottish accent --in fluent German, by the way, but in a Scottish accent --and explains to them how German culture was the culturethat gave Schiller and Goethe to the world.And he can't understandhow this barbarism can be tolerated,and he vents his frustrations.And then he goes back to his quarters,breaks down and weepsbecause he's convinced that the situation is hopeless.But a young German doctorpicks up Archie Cochrane's exercise bookand says to his colleagues,"This evidence is incontrovertible.If we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners,it's a war crime."And the next morning,supplies of vitamin B12 are delivered to the camp,and the prisoners begin to recover.Now I'm not telling you this storybecause I think Archie Cochrane is a dude,although Archie Cochrane is a dude.I'm not even telling you the storybecause I think we should be runningmore carefully controlled randomized trialsin all aspects of public policy,although I think that would also be completely awesome.I'm telling you this storybecause Archie Cochrane, all his life,fought against a terrible affliction,and he realized it was debilitating to individualsand it was corrosive to societies.And he had a name for it.He called it the God complex.Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very, very easily.So the symptoms of the complexare, no matter how complicated the problem,you have an absolutely overwhelming beliefthat you are infallibly right in your solution.Now Archie was a doctor,so he hung around with doctors a lot.And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot.Now I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor,but I see the God complex around me all the timein my fellow economists.I see it in our business leaders.I see it in the politicians we vote for --people who, in the face of an incredibly complicated world,are nevertheless absolutely convincedthat they understand the way that the world works.And you know, with the future billions that we've been hearing about,the world is simply far too complexto understand in that way.Well let me give you an example.Imagine for a momentthat, instead of Tim Harford in front of you,there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs.You know Hans:the Mick Jagger of TED.(Laughter)And he'd be showing you these amazing statistics,these amazing animations.And they are brilliant; it's wonderful work.But a typical Hans Rosling graph:think for a moment, not what it shows,but think instead about what it leaves out.So it'll show you GDP per capita,population, longevity,that's about it.So three pieces of data for each country --three pieces of data.Three pieces of data is nothing.I mean, have a look at this graph.This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo.He's at MIT.Now you won't be able to understand a word of it,but this is what it looks like.Cesar has trolled the databaseof over 5,000 different products,and he's used techniques of network analysisto interrogate this databaseand to graph relationships between the different products.And it's wonderful, wonderful work.You show all these interconnections, all these interrelations.And I think it'll be profoundly usefulin understanding how it is that economies grow.Brilliant work.Cesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazineexplaining how this works.And what we learnedis Cesar's work is far too good to explainin The New York Times Magazine.Five thousand products --that's still nothing.Five thousand products --imagine counting every product categoryin Cesar Hidalgo's data.Imagine you had one secondper product category.In about the length of this session,you would have counted all 5,000.Now imagine doing the same thingfor every different type of product on sale in Walmart.There are 100,000 there. It would take you all day.Now imagine trying to countevery different specific product and serviceon sale in a major economysuch as Tokyo, London or New York.It's even more difficult in Edinburghbecause you have to count all the whisky and the tartan.If you wanted to count every product and serviceon offer in New York --there are 10 billion of them --it would take you 317 years.This is how complex the economy we've created is.And I'm just counting toasters here.I'm not trying to solve the Middle East problem.The complexity here is unbelievable.And just a piece of context --the societies in which our brains evolvedhad about 300 products and services.You could count them in five minutes.So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us.This perhaps is whywe find the God complex so tempting.We tend to retreat and say, "We can draw a picture,we can post some graphs,we get it, we understand how this works."And we don't.We never do.Now I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here.I'm not trying to say we can't solvecomplicated problems in a complicated world.We clearly can.But the way we solve themis with humility --to abandon the God complexand to actually use a problem-solving technique that works.And we have a problem-solving technique that works.Now you show mea successful complex system,and I will show you a systemthat has evolved through trial and error.Here's an example.This baby was produced through trial and error.I realize that's an ambiguous statement.Maybe I should clarify it.This baby is a human body: it evolved.What is evolution?Over millions of years, variation and selection,variation and selection --trial and error,trial and error.And it's not just biological systemsthat produce miracles through trial and error.You could use it in an industrial context.So let's say you wanted to make detergent.Let's say you're Unileverand you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool.How do you do it?Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent.You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle.You create a spray of detergent.Then the spray dries. It turns into powder.It falls to the floor.You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes.You sell it at a supermarket.You make lots of money.How do you design that nozzle?It turns out to be very important.Now if you ascribe to the God complex,what you do is you find yourself a little God.You find yourself a mathematician; you find yourself a physicist --somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid.And he will, or she will,calculate the optimal design of the nozzle.Now Unilever did this and it didn't work --too complicated.Even this problem, too complicated.But the geneticist Professor Steve Jonesdescribes how Unilever actually did solve this problem --trial and error,variation and selection.You take a nozzleand you create 10 random variations on the nozzle.You try out all 10; you keep the one that works best.You create 10 variations on that one.You try out all 10. You keep the one that works best.You try out 10 variations on that one.You see how this works, right?And after 45 generations,you have this incredible nozzle.It looks a bit like a chess piece --functions absolutely brilliantly.We have no ideawhy it works,no idea at all.And the moment you step back from the God complex --let's just try to have a bunch of stuff;let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not --you can solve your problem.Now this process of trial and erroris actually far more common in successful institutionsthan we care to recognize.And we've heard a lot about how economies function.The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy.How did it become the world's greatest economy?I could give you all kinds of facts and figuresabout the U.S. economy,but I think the most salient one is this:ten percent of American businessesdisappear every year.That is a huge failure rate.It's far higher than the failure rate of, say, Americans.Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year.Which leads us to concludeAmerican businesses fail faster than Americans,and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans.And eventually, they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfectionthat they will make us all their pets --(Laughter)if, of course, they haven't already done so.I sometimes wonder.But it's this process of trial and errorthat explains this great divergence,this incredible performance of Western economies.It didn't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge.It's come through trial and error.Now I've been sort of banging on about thisfor the last couple of months,and people sometimes say to me,"Well Tim, it's kind of obvious.Obviously trial and error is very important.Obviously experimentation is very important.Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing?"So I say, okay, fine.You think it's obvious?I will admit it's obviouswhen schoolsstart teaching childrenthat there are some problems that don't have a correct answer.Stop giving them lists of questionsevery single one of which has an answer.And there's an authority figure in the cornerbehind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers.And if you can't find the answers,you must be lazy or stupid.When schools stop doing that all the time,I will admit that, yes,it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing.When a politician stands upcampaigning for elected officeand says, "I want to fix our health system.I want to fix our education system.I have no idea how to do it.I have half a dozen ideas.We're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail.Then we'll test some other ideas out.We'll find some that work. We'll build on those.We'll get rid of the ones that don't." --when a politician campaigns on that platform,and more importantly, when voters like you and meare willing to vote for that kind of politician,then I will admitthat it is obvious that trial and error works, and that -- thank you.(Applause)Until then, until thenI'm going to keep banging on about trial and errorand why we should abandon the God complex.Because it's so hardto admit our own fallibility.It's so uncomfortable.And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody.There's this one trial he ranmany years after World War II.He wanted to test outthe question of, where is itthat patients should recoverfrom heart attacks?Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital,or should they recover at home?All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down.They had the God complex in spades.They knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients,and they knew it was very unethicalto run any kind of trial or experiment.Nevertheless, Archie managed to get permission to do this.He ran his trial.And after the trial had been running for a little while,he gathered together all his colleaguesaround his table,and he said, "Well, gentlemen,we have some preliminary results.They're not statistically significant.But we have something.And it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong.It is dangerous for patientsto recover from heart attacks at home.They should be in hospital."And there's this uproar, and all the doctors start pounding the tableand saying, "We always said you were unethical, Archie.You're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now.Shut it down at once."And there's this huge hubbub.Archie lets it die down.And then he says, "Well that's very interesting, gentlemen,because when I gave you the table of results,I swapped the two columns around.It turns out your hospitals are killing people,and they should be at home.Would you like to close down the trial now,or should we wait until we have robust results?"Tumbleweedrolls through the meeting room.But Cochrane would do that kind of thing.And the reason he would do that kind of thingis because he understoodit feels so much betterto stand there and say,"Here in my own little world,I am a god, I understand everything.I do not want to have my opinions challenged.I do not want to have my conclusions tested."It feels so much more comfortablesimply to lay down the law.Cochrane understoodthat uncertainty, that fallibility,that being challenged, they hurt.And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that.Now I'm not going to pretend that this is easy.It isn't easy.It's incredibly painful.And since I started talking about this subjectand researching this subject,I've been really haunted by somethinga Japanese mathematician said on the subject.So shortly after the war,this young man, Yutaka Taniyama,developed this amazing conjecturecalled the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture.It turned out to be absolutely instrumentalmany decades laterin proving Fermat's Last Theorem.In fact, it turns out it's equivalentto proving Fermat's Last Theorem.You prove one, you prove the other.But it was always a conjecture.Taniyama tried and tried and triedand he could never prove that it was true.And shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958,Yutaka Taniyama killed himself.His friend, Goro Shimura --who worked on the mathematics with him --many decades later, reflected on Taniyama's life.He said,"He was not a very careful personas a mathematician.He made a lot of mistakes.But he made mistakes in a good direction.I tried to emulate him,but I realizedit is very difficultto make good mistakes."Thank you.(Applause)

I'm here todayto start a revolution.Now before you get up in arms,or you break into song,or you pick a favorite color,I want to define what I mean by revolution.By revolution,I mean a drastic and far-reaching changein the way we think and behave --the way we think and the way we behave.Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?We need a revolutionbecause things aren't working; they're just not working.And that makes me really sadbecause I'm sick and tired of things not working.You know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.I'm sick and tired of us being last.And we are last place in so many things --for example, social factors.We're last place in Europe in innovation.There we are right at the end, right at the bottom,last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation.We're last place in health care,and that's important for a sense of well-being.And there we are, not just last in the E.U.,we're last in Europe, at the very bottom.And worst of all,it just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist.We're the saddest place on Earth,relative to GDP per capita --the saddest place on Earth.That's social. Let's look at education.Where do we rank three weeks agoin another report by the OECD?Last in reading, math and science. Last.Business:The lowest perception in the E.U.that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society.Why as a result, what happens?The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses.And this is despite the factthat everybody knows that small businessis the engine of economies.We hire the most people; we create the most taxes.So if our engine's broken, guess what?Last in Europe GDP per capita.Last.So it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgariansare not optimistic about the future.We're unhappy, we have bad education,and we have the worst businesses.And these are facts, guys.This isn't story tale; it's not make-believe.It's not.It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts.So I think it should be really, really clearthat our system is broken.The way we think, the way we behave,our operating system of behaving is broken.We need a drastic change in the way we think and behaveto transform Bulgaria for the better,for ourselves, for our friends,for our family and for our future.How did this happen?Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen?I think we're last because --and this is going to be drastic to some of you --because we are handicapping ourselves.We're holding ourselves backbecause we don't value play.I said "play," all right.In case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like.Babies play, kids play,adults play.We don't value play.In fact, we devalue play.And we devalue it in three areas.Let's go back to the same three areas.Social: 45 years of what?Of communism --of valuing the society and the state over the individualand squashing, inadvertently,creativity, individual self-expression and innovation.And instead, what do we value?Because it's shownthe way we apply, generate and use knowledgeis affected by our social and institutional context,which told us what in communism?To be serious.To be really, really serious.It did.(Applause)Be serious.I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the parkfor letting my kids play on the ground.Heaven forbid they play in the dirt, the kal,or even worse, lokvi, water -- that will kill them.I have been told by babas and dyadosthat we shouldn't let our kids play so muchbecause life is seriousand we need to train them for the seriousness of life.We have a serious meme running through.It's a social gene running through us.It's a serious gene.It's 45 years of itthat's created what I call the "baba factor."(Laughter)(Applause)And here's how it works.Step one: woman says, "I want to have a baby. Iskam baby."Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo!But then what happens in step three?I want to go back to workbecause I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.I'm going to give bebko to baba.But we need to rememberthat baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years.So what happens?She passes that virus on to baby,and it takes a really, really, really long time -- as the redwood trees --for that serious memeto get out of our operating system.What happens then?It goes into education where we have an antiquated education systemthat has little changed for 100 years,that values rote learning,memorization and standardization,and devalues self-expression, self-exploration,questioning, creativity and play.It's a crap system.True story: I went looking for a school for my kid.We went to this prestigious little schooland they say they're going to study math 10 times a weekand science eight times a weekand reading five times a day and all this stuff.And we said, "Well what about play and recess?"And they said, "Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule."(Laughter)And we said, "He's five."What a crime. What a crime.And it's a crimethat our education system is so serious because education is seriousthat we're creating mindless, robotic workersto put bolts in pre-drilled holes.But I'm sorry, the problems of todayare not the problems of the Industrial Revolution.We need adaptability,the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.We don't need mechanized workers.But no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play.We create robotic workers that we treat like assets,to lever and just throw away.What are qualities of a Bulgarian work?Autocratic --do what I say because I'm the chef.I'm the boss and I know better than you.Untrusting -- you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras.(Laughter)Controlling --you're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to makea zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box.So they're restrictive -- don't use your mobile phone,don't use your laptop, don't search the Internet,don't be on I.M.That's somehow unprofessional and bad.And at the end of the day, it's unfulfillingbecause you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valuedand you're not having any fun.In social, in education and in our business,don't value play.And that's why we're last,because we don't value play.And you can say, "That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea.It can't be because of play.Just play, that's a stupid thing."We have the serious meme in us.Well I'm going to say no.And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech --that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution,that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.Play:our brainsare hardwired for play.Evolution has selected,over millions and billions of years,for play in animals and in humans.And you know what?Evolution does a really, really good jobof deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to usand selecting traits for competitive advantage.Nature isn't stupid, and it selected for play.Throughout the animal kingdom, for example:ants. Ants play.Maybe you didn't know that.But when they're playing,they're learning the social order and dynamics of things.Rats play, but what you might not have knownis that rats that play morehave bigger brainsand they learn tasks better,skills.Kittens play. We all know kittens play.But what you may not knowis that kittens deprived of playare unable to interact socially.They can still hunt, but they can't be social.Bears play.But what you may not knowis that bears that play more survive longer.It's not the bears that learn how to fish better.It's the ones that play more.And a final really interesting study --it's been shown, a correlationbetween play and brain size.The more you play, the bigger the brains there are.Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.But who do you thinkwith the biggest brains are the biggest players?Yours truly: humans.Kids play, we play --of every nationality, of every race,of every color, of every religion.It's a universal thing -- we play.And it's not just kids, it's adults too.Really cool term: neoteny --the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.And who are the biggest neotenists?Humans. We play sports.We do it for fun, or as Olympians, or as professionals.We play musical instruments.We dance, we kiss, we sing,we just goof around.We're designed by nature to playfrom birth to old age.We're designed to do that continuously --to play and play a lotand not stop playing.It is a huge benefit.Just like there's benefits to animals,there's benefits to humans.For example, it's been shownto stimulate neural growth in the amygdala,in the area where it controls emotions.It's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex developmentwhere a lot of cognition is happening.As a result, what happens?We develop more emotional maturity if we play more.We develop better decision-making abilityif we play more.These guys are facts.It's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe;it's cold, hard science.These are the benefits to play.It is a genetic birthright that we have,like walking or speaking or seeing.And if we handicap ourselves with play,we handicap ourselvesas if we would with any other birthright that we have.We hold ourselves back.Little exercise just for a second:close your eyesand try to imagine a world without play.Imagine a world without theater, without the arts,without song, without dancing,without soccer, without football,without laughter.What does this world look like?It's pretty bleak.It's pretty glum.Now imagine your workplace.Is it fun? Is it playful?Or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we're forward thinking.Is it fun? Is it playful?Or is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling,restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling?We have this conceptthat the opposite of play is work.We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work."Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work,"or, "Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me.He's going to think I'm not working hard."But I have news for you: our thinking is backwards.The opposite of playis not work.The opposite of playis depression. It's depression.In fact,play improves our work.Just like there's benefits for humans and animals,there's benefits for play at work.For example, it stimulates creativity.It increases our openness to change.It improves our ability to learn.It provides a sense of purpose and mastery --two key motivational thingsthat increase productivity,through play.So before you start thinking of play as just not serious,play doesn't mean frivolous.You know, the professional athlete that loves skiing,he's serious about it, but he loves it.He's having fun, he's in the groove, he's in the flow.A doctor might be serious,but laughter's still a great medicine.Our thinking is backwards.We shouldn't be feeling guilty.We should be celebrating play.Quick example from the corporate world.FedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit.If you treat your people like people, if you treat them great,they're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose.What happens? They give better service --not worse, but better.And when customers call for serviceand they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled,how do the customers feel? They feel great.And what do great customers do, great-feeling customers?They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends,which leads to more profit.People, service, profit.Play increases productivity, not decreases.And you're going to say,"Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States,but it can't work in Bulgaria.No way. We're different."It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.One, play is universal.There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play,besides the serious meme that we have to kick out.Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.When I got there, we had zero happy customers.Not one customer would refer us.I asked them all.We had marginal profit -- I did.We had marginal profits,and we had unhappy stakeholders.Through some basic change,change like improving transparency,change like promoting self-directionand collaboration, encouraging collaboration,not autocracy,the things like having a results-focus.I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave.I care that your customer and your team is happyand you're organized with that.Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?Basically promoting fun.Through promoting fun and a great environment,we were able to transform Sciantand, in just three short years --sounds like a long time, but change is slow --every customer, from zero to every customer referring us,above average profits for the industryand happy stakeholders.And you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?"Well we did win, every year that we entered,one of the rankings for best employer for small business.Independent analysis from anonymous employeeson their surveys.It does, and it can, work in Bulgaria.There's nothing holding us back,except our own mentality about play.So some steps that we can take -- to finish up --how to make this revolution through play.First of all, you have to believe me.If you don't believe me,well just go home and think about it some more or something.Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you,you need to rediscover play.Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy,that you enjoyed only six months ago,but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy,because you feel like you have to be serious,rediscover it.I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game.Rediscover thatbecause you're the leaders,the innovation leaders, the thought leaders.You're the ones that have to go back to the officeor talk to your friendsand ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it,your colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it.You've got to go back and say, "Hey, I'm going to trust you."Weird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you,and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top.I'm going to encourage constructive criticism.I'm going to let you challenge authority.Because it's by challenging the way things are always doneis that we are able to break out of the rut that we're inand create innovative solutionsto problems of today.We're not always right as leaders.We're going to eradicate fear.Fear is the enemy of play.And we're going to do thingslike eliminate restrictions.You know what, let them use their mobile phonefor personal calls -- heaven forbid.Let them be on the Internet.Let them be on instant messengers.Let them take long lunches.Lunch is like the recess for work.It's when you go out in the worldand you recharge your brain, you meet your friends,you have a beer, you have some food, you talk,you get some synergy of ideasthat maybe you wouldn't have had before.Let them do it. Give them some freedom,and in general, let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace.We spend so much of our lives at the workplace,and it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind,so that 20 years from now, we wake up and say, "Is this it?Is that all there was?"Unacceptable. Nepriemliv.(Laughter)So in summary,we need a drastic changein the way we think and behave,but we don't needa workers' revolution.We don't need a workers' revolution.What we needis a players' uprising.What we need is a players' uprising.What we need is a players' uprising.Seriously, we need to band together.Today is the start of the uprising.But what you need to dois fan the flames of the revolution.You need to go and share your ideas and your success storiesof what workedabout reinvigorating our lives, our schools,and our work with play;about how play promotesa sense of promise and self-fulfillment;of how play promotes innovation and productivity,and, ultimately, how play creates meaning.Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together,and together, if we do this and share these ideas on play,we can transform Bulgaria for the better.Thank you.(Applause)



paul_romer_the_world_s_first_charter_city
455595

In 2007,I decided that we needed to reconceptualizehow we thought about economic development.Our new goal should bethat when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,they should be able to choose betweenat least a handfulof different citiesthat were all competing to attract new residents.Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.There are billions of people in developing countrieswho don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.But the amazing thing about citiesis they're worth so much morethan it costs to build them.So we could easily supply the worldwith dozens, maybe hundreds,of new cities.Now this might sound preposterous to youif you've never thought about new cities.But just substitute apartment building for cities.Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;the other half aren't there yet.You could try and expand the capacityby doing additions on all the existing apartments.But you know what you'd run intois those apartments and the surrounding areashave rules to avoid discomfortand the distractions of construction.So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.But you could go out someplace brand new,build a brand new apartment building,as long as the rules therewere ones that facilitated constructionrather than getting in the way.So I proposedthat governments create new reform zonesbig enough to hold citiesand gave them a name: charter cities.Later I learned that at about this same time,Javier and Octaviowere thinking about the challenge of reformin Honduras.They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every yearwould leave to go to the United States,and they wanted to ask, what could they doto make sure that those people could stayand do the same things in Honduras.At one point, Javier said to Octavio,"What if we took some of our empty land --what if we just gave it to an embassy --give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy --and then if people want to go workunder the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States,they can go get jobs,do everything they do on those embassy groundsthat they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?"In the summer of 2009,Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.At the next regularly scheduled election,Pepe Lobo won in a landslideon a platform that promised reform,but reconciliation as well.He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.Meanwhile, I was getting readyto give a talk at TEDGlobal.Through a process of refinement,trial and error, a lot of user testing,I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter citydown to the bare essentials.The first point was the importance of rules,like those rules that sayyou can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.We pay a lot of attention to new technologies,but it takes technologies and rules to get progress,and it's usually the rules that hold us back.In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemalasent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.He showed it to Javier.They called me.They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country."So in December we met in Miami,in a hotel conference room.I tried to explain this pointabout how valuable cities are,how much more valuable they are than they cost.And I used this slideshowing how valuable the raw land isin a place like New York City:notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,per square meter.But it was a fairly abstract discussion,and at some point when there was a pause,Octavio said,"Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk."(Laughing)So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,a charter city is a placewhere you start with uninhabited land,a charter that specifies the rules that will apply thereand then a chance for people to opt in,to go live under those rules or not.So I was asked by the president of Honduraswho said that we need to do this project,this is important,this could be the way forward for our country.I was asked to come to Tegucigalpaand talk again on January fourth and fifth.So I presentedanother fact-filled lecturethat included a slide like this,which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,it has to be very big.This is a picture of Denver,and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.This airport alonecovers more than 100 square kilometers.So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans,if you build a new city,you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.Everybody applauded politely.The faces in the audiencewere very serious and attentive.The leader of the congress came up on stage and said,"Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.I've got it here on my laptop."So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.And it got to the essence,which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.There would be a choice of a city which you could go towhich could be in Honduras,instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.And it also involved new choices for leaders.Because the leaders in the government there in Honduraswould need help from partner countries,who could benefit from partner countrieswho help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement,so everybody can trustthat the charter really will be enforced.And the insight of President Lobowas that that assurance of enforcementthat I was thinking aboutas a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the citycould be equally important for all the different parties in Honduraswho had suffered for so many yearsfrom fear and distrust.We went and looked at a site.This picture's from there.It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.And shortly thereafter, on January 19th,they voted in the congress to amend their constitutionto have a constitutional provisionthat allows for special development regions.In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendmentwas 124 to one.All parties, all factions in society, backed this.To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.On February 17th they passed it againwith another vote of 114 to one.Immediately after that vote,on February 21st to the 24th,a delegation of about 30 Honduranswent to the two places in the worldthat are most interested in getting into the city building business.One is South Korea.This is a picture of a big, new city centerthat's being built in South Korea --bigger than downtown Boston.Everything you see there was built in four years,after they spent four years getting the permits.The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.They've actually built two cities already in Chinaand are preparing the third.So if you think about this practically,here's where we are.They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.They're putting in place a legal systemthat could allow for managers to come in,and also an external legal system.One country has already volunteered to let its supreme courtbe the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.There's designers and builders of citieswho are very interested.They even can bring with them some financing.But the one thing you know they've already solvedis that there's lots of tenants.There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,especially in a place with a free trade zone,and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.Around the world, there's 700 million peoplewho say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.There's a million a yearwho leave Latin America to go to the United States.Many of these are a fatherwho has to leave his family behind to go get a job --sometimes a single motherwho has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.Sadly, sometimes there are even childrenwho are trying to get reunited with their parentsthat they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.So what kind of an idea is itto think about building a brand new city in Honduras?Or to build a dozen of these,or a hundred of these, around the world?What kind of an idea is itto think about insistingthat every family have a choice of several citiesthat are competing to attract new residents?This is an idea worth spreading.And my friends from Hondurasasked me to say thank you, TED.(Applause)

Imagine a plane full of smoke.It sounds scary.Well, I had a unique seat that day.I was sitting in 1D.So I looked at them right away,and we weren't that far.You could see Manhattan.Two minutes later,three things happened at the same time.That's usually not the route.(Laughter)He turns off the engines.And then he says three words.He says, "Brace for impact."(Laughter)I could see in her eyes, it was terror.Life was over.We have this bucket list,all the fences I wanted to mend,As I thought about that later on,I came up with a saying,which is, "I collect bad wines."The second thing I learned that day --which was by not a lot --(Laughter)I've lived a good life.In my own humanity and mistakes,with people that matter.with my friends, with people.And after, as I reflected on that,It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.It feels great.I no longer try to be right;I choose to be happy.The third thing I learned --You can see the water coming.I'm saying, "Please blow up."like you've seen in those documentaries.And as we're coming down,I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.But it was very sad.I didn't want to go; I love my life.which is, I only wish for one thing.I only wish I could see my kids grow up.first-grader, not much artistic talent --(Laughter)Yet!(Laughter)is being a great dad.Above all, above all,I was given the gift of a miracle,of not dying that day.I was given another gift,and come backand live differently.and please don't --but imagine, and how would you change?What would you get doneHow would you change your relationshipsand the negative energy in them?Thank you.(Applause)

So I was privileged to train in transplantationunder two great surgical pioneers:Thomas Starzl,who performed the world's first successful liver transplantin 1967,and Sir Roy Calne,who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K.in the following year.I returned to Singaporeand, in 1990,performed Asia's first successfulcadaveric liver transplant procedure,but against all odds.Now when I look back,the transplant was actually the easiest part.Next, raising the money to fund the procedure.But perhaps the most challenging partwas to convince the regulators --a matter which was debated in the parliament --that a young female surgeonbe allowed the opportunityto pioneer for her country.But 20 years on,my patient, Surinder,is Asia's longest survivingcadaveric liver transplant to date.(Applause)And perhaps more important,I am the proud godmotherto her 14 year-old son.(Applause)But not all patients on the transplant wait listare so fortunate.The truth is,there are just simply not enough donor organsto go around.As the demand for donor organscontinues to rise,in large part due to the aging population,the supply has remained relatively constant.In the United States alone,100,000 men, women and childrenare on the waiting list for donor organs,and more than a dozen die each daybecause of a lack of donor organs.The transplant communityhas actively campaigned in organ donation.And the gift of lifehas been extendedfrom brain-dead donorsto living, related donors --relatives who might donate an organor a part of an organ,like a split liver graft,to a relative or loved one.But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs,the gift of life was then extendedfrom living, related donorsto now living, unrelated donors.And this then has given riseto unprecedented and unexpectedmoral controversy.How can one distinguisha donation that is voluntary and altruisticfrom one that is forced or coercedfrom, for example,a submissive spouse, an in-law,a servant, a slave,an employee?Where and how can we draw the line?In my part of the world,too many people live below the poverty line.And in some areas,the commercial gifting of an organin exchange for monetary rewardhas led to a flourishing tradein living, unrelated donors.Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant,I received my next assignment,and that was to go to the prisonsto harvest organsfrom executed prisoners.I was also pregnant at the time.Pregnancies are meantto be happy and fulfilling momentsin any woman's life.But my joyful periodwas marred by solemn and morbid thoughts --thoughts of walking throughthe prison's high-security death row,as this was the only routeto take me to the makeshift operating room.And at each time,I would feel the chilling staresof condemned prisoners' eyes follow me.And for two years,I struggled with the dilemmaof waking up at 4:30 amon a Friday morning,driving to the prison,getting down, gloved and scrubbed,ready to receive the bodyof an executed prisoner,remove the organsand then transport these organsto the recipient hospitaland then graft the gift of lifeto a recipient the same afternoon.No doubt, I was informed,the consent had been obtained.But, in my life,the one fulfilling skill that I hadwas now invoking feelings of conflict --conflict rangingfrom extreme sorrow and doubt at dawnto celebratory joyat engrafting the gift of life at dusk.In my team,the lives of one or two of my colleagueswere tainted by this experience.Some of us may have been sublimated,but really none of us remained the same.I was troubledthat the retrieval of organs from executed prisonerswas at least as morally controversialas the harvesting of stem cellsfrom human embryos.And in my mind,I realized as a surgical pioneerthat the purpose of my position of influencewas surely to speak upfor those who have no influence.It made me wonderif there could be a better way --a way to circumvent deathand yet deliver the gift of lifethat might exponentially impactmillions of patients worldwide.Now just about that time,the practice of surgery evolvedfrom big to small,from wide open incisionsto keyhole procedures,tiny incisions.And in transplantation, concepts shiftedfrom whole organs to cells.In 1988, at the University of Minnesota,I participated in a small seriesof whole organ pancreas transplants.I witnessed the technical difficulty.And this inspired in my minda shift from transplanting whole organsto perhaps transplanting cells.I thought to myself,why not take the individual cellsout of the pancreas --the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes --and transplant these cells? --technically a much simpler procedurethan having to grapple with the complexitiesof transplanting a whole organ.And at that time,stem cell researchhad gained momentum,following the isolation of the world's firsthuman embryonic stem cellsin the 1990s.The observation that stem cells, as master cells,could give riseto a whole variety of different cell types --heart cells, liver cells,pancreatic islet cells --captured the attention of the mediaand the imagination of the public.I too was fascinatedby this new and disruptive cell technology,and this inspired a shift in my mindset,from transplanting whole organsto transplanting cells.And I focused my research on stem cellsas a possible sourcefor cell transplants.Today we realizethat there are many different types of stem cells.Embryonic stem cellshave occupied center stage,chiefly because of their pluripotency --that is their ease in differentiatinginto a variety of different cell types.But the moral controversysurrounding embryonic stem cells --the fact that these cells are derivedfrom five-day old human embryos --has encouraged researchinto other types of stem cells.Now to the ridicule of my colleagues,I inspired my labto focus on what I thoughtwas the most non-controversial source of stem cells,adipose tissue, or fat, yes fat --nowadays available in abundant supply --you and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway.Fat-derived stem cellsare adult stem cells.And adult stem cellsare found in you and me --in our blood, in our bone marrow,in our fat, our skin and other organs.And as it turns out,fat is one of the best sourcesof adult stem cells.But adult stem cellsare not embryonic stem cells.And here is the limitation:adult stem cells are mature cells,and, like mature human beings,these cells are more restricted in their thoughtand more restricted in their behaviorand are unable to give riseto the wide variety of specialized cell types,as embryonic stem cells [can].But in 2007,two remarkable individuals,Shinya Yamanaka of Japanand Jamie Thomson of the United States,made an astounding discovery.They discoveredthat adult cells, taken from you and me,could be reprogrammedback into embryonic-like cells,which they termed IPS cells,or induced pluripotent stem cells.And so guess what,scientists around the world and in the labsare racingto convert aging adult cells --aging adult cells from you and me --they are racing to reprogram these cellsback into more useful IPS cells.And in our lab,we are focused on taking fatand reprogrammingmounds of fatinto fountains of youthful cells --cells that we may useto then form other,more specialized, cells,which one day may be used as cell transplants.If this research is successful,it may then reduce the needto research and sacrificehuman embryos.Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hopethat the promise of stem cellswill one day provide curesfor a whole range of conditions.Heart disease, stroke, diabetes,spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy,retinal eye diseases --are any of these conditionsrelevant, personally, to you?In May 2006,something horrible happened to me.I was about to start a robotic operation,but stepping out of the elevatorinto the bright and glaring lights of the operating room,I realizedthat my left visual fieldwas fast collapsing into darkness.Earlier that week,I had taken a rather hard knockduring late spring skiing -- yes, I fell.And I started to see floaters and stars,which I casually dismissedas too much high-altitude sun exposure.What happened to memight have been catastrophic,if not for the factthat I was in reach of good surgical access.And I had my vision restored,but not before a prolonged period of convalescence --three months --in a head down position.This experiencetaught me to empathize more with my patients,and especially those with retinal diseases.37 million people worldwideare blind,and 127 million moresuffer from impaired vision.Stem cell-derived retinal transplants,now in a research phase,may one day restore vision,or part vision,to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide.Indeed, we livein both challengingas well as exciting times.As the world population ages,scientists are racingto discover new waysto enhance the power of the bodyto heal itself through stem cells.It is a factthat when our organs or tissues are injured,our bone marrowreleases stem cellsinto our circulation.And these stem cellsthen float in the bloodstreamand hone in to damaged organsto release growth factorsto repair the damaged tissue.Stem cells may be used as building blocksto repair damaged scaffolds within our body,or to provide new liver cellsto repair damaged liver.As we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trialsresearching the use of stem cellsfor liver diseases.What lies ahead?Heart diseaseis the leading cause of death worldwide.1.1 million Americanssuffer heart attacks yearly.4.8 millionsuffer cardiac failure.Stem cells may be usedto deliver growth factorsto repair damaged heart muscleor be differentiatedinto heart muscle cellsto restore heart function.There are 170 clinical trialsinvestigating the role of stem cells in heart disease.While still in a research phase,stem cells may one day heralda quantum leap in the field of cardiology.Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings --small, incremental steps,cells rather than organs,repair rather than replacement.Stem cell therapiesmay one day reduce the need for donor organs.Powerful new technologiesalways present enigmas.As we speak,the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injuryis currently underwayfollowing the USFDA approval.And in the U.K.,neural stem cells to treat strokeare being investigated in a phase one trial.The research success that we celebrate todayhas been made possibleby the curiosity and contribution and commitmentof individual scientistsand medical pioneers.Each one has his story.My story has been about my journeyfrom organs to cells --a journey through controversy,inspired by hope --hope that, as we age,you and I may one day celebrate longevitywith an improved quality of life.Thank you.

Can any of youremember what you wanted to bewhen you were 17?Do you know what I wanted to be?I wanted to be a biker chick.(Laughter)I wanted to race cars,and I wanted to be a cowgirl,and I wanted to be Mowgli from "The Jungle Book."Because they were all about being free,the wind in your hair -- just to be free.And on my seventeenth birthday,my parents, knowing how much I loved speed,gave me one driving lessonfor my seventeenth birthday.Not that we could have afforded I drive,but to give me the dream of driving.And on my seventeenth birthday,I accompanied my little sisterin complete innocence,as I always had all my life --my visually impaired sister --to go to see an eye specialist.Because big sistersare always supposed to support their little sisters.And my little sister wanted to be a pilot --God help her.So I used to get my eyes testedjust for fun.And on my seventeenth birthday,after my fake eye exam,the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday.And he said, "So what are you going to do to celebrate?"And I took that driving lesson,and I said, "I'm going to learn how to drive."And then there was a silence --one of those awful silenceswhen you know something's wrong.And he turned to my mother,and he said, "You haven't told her yet?"On my seventeenth birthday,as Janis Ian would best say,I learned the truth at 17.I am, and have been since birth,legally blind.And you know,how on earth did I get to 17and not know that?Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful,let me tell you this:I got therebecause my father's passion for Johnny Cashand a song, "A Boy Named Sue."I'm the eldest of three. I was born in 1971.And very shortly after my birth,my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism.And what the hell does that mean to you?So let me just tell you, the great part of all of this?I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing,so holy God, woohoo! (Laughter)I might buy some more time.But more importantly, let me tell you --I'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out, Pat.Hey.See this hand?Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline.Every man in this room, even you, Steve,is George Clooney.(Laughter)And every woman, you are so beautiful.And when I want to look beautiful, I step three feet away from the mirror,and I don't have to see these lines etched in my facefrom all the squinting I've done all my lifefrom all the dark lights.The really strange part isthat, at three and a half, just before I was going to school,my parents made a bizarre, unusualand incredibly brave decision.No special needs schools.No labels.No limitations.My ability and my potential.And they decided to tell methat I could see.So just like Johnny Cash's Sue,a boy given a girl's name,I would grow up and learn from experiencehow to be tough and how to survive,when they were no longer there to protect me,or just take it all away.But more significantly,they gave me the abilityto believe,totally, to believe that I could.And so when I heard that eye specialisttell me all the things, a big fat "no,"everybody imagines I was devastated.And don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it --aside from the fact that I thought he was insane --I got that thump in my chest,just that "huh?"But very quickly I recovered. It was like that.The first thing I thought about was my mom,who was crying over beside me.And I swear to God, I walked out of his office,"I will drive. I will drive.You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive."And with the same dogged determinationthat my father had bred into me since I was such a child --he taught me how to sail,knowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore,and I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination.But he told me to believeand feel the wind in my face.And that wind in my face made me believethat he was mad and I would drive.And for the next 11 years,I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see,because I didn't want to be a failure,and I didn't want to be weak.And I believed I could do it.So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do.And I was an archeologist, and then I broke things.And then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped on things.And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener.And then I went to business school.And you know, disabled people are hugely educated.And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture.And they didn't even know.And it's extraordinaryhow far belief can take you.In 1999,two and a half years into that job,something happened.Wonderfully, my eyes decided, enough.And temporarily,very unexpectedly,they dropped.And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world,where you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best.And two years in,I really could see very little.And I found myself in front of an HR managerin 1999,saying something I never imagined that I would say.I was 28 years old.I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do.And I simply said,"I'm sorry.I can't see, and I need help."Asking for help can be incredibly difficult.And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that.We all know how hard it isto admit weakness and failure.And it's frightening, isn't it?But all that belief had fueled me so long.And can I tell you, operating in the sighted world when you can't see,it's kind of difficult -- it really is.Can I tell you, airports are a disaster.Oh, for the love of God.And please, any designers out there?OK, designers, please put up your hands, even though I can't even see you.I always end up in the gents' toilets.And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell.But can I just tell you,the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toiletis determined by a triangle.Have you ever tried to see thatif you have Vaseline in front of your eyes?It's such a small thing, right?And you know how exhausting it can beto try to be perfect when you're not,or to be somebody that you aren't?And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR,they sent me off to an eye specialist.And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life.But before I got to him, I was so lost.I had no idea who I was anymore.And that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes.God no, it was therapy.And he asked me several questions,of which many were, "Why?Why are you fighting so hardnot to be yourself?And do you love what you do, Caroline?"And you know, when you go to a global consulting firm,they put a chip in your head, and you're like,"I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture." (Laughter)To leave would be failure.And he said, "Do you love it?"I couldn't even speak I was so choked up.I just was so -- how do I tell him?And then he said to me, "What did you want to be when you were little?"Now listen, I wasn't going to say to him, "Well, I wanted to race cars and motorbikes."Hardly appropriate at this moment in time.He thought I was mad enough anyway.And as I left his office,he called me backand he said, "I think it's time.I think it's timeto stop fighting and do something different."And that door closed.And that silence just outside a doctor's office,that many of us know.And my chest ached.And I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea.But I did know the game was up.And I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much,I thought, "I'll go out for a run."Really not a very sensible thing to do.And I went on a run that I know so well.I know this run so well, by the back of my hand.I always run it perfectly fine.I count the steps and the lampposts and all those thingsthat visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with.And there was a rock that I always missed.And I'd never fallen on it, never.And there I was crying away,and smash, bash on my rock.Broken, fallen overon this rockin the middle of March in 2000,typical Irish weather on a Wednesday --gray, snot, tears everywhere,ridiculously self-pitying.And I was floored, and I was broken,and I was angry.And I didn't know what to do.And I sat there for quite some time going,"How am I going to get off this rock and go home?Because who am I going to be?What am I going to be?"And I thought about my dad,and I thought, "Good God, I'm so not Sue now."And I kept thinking over and over in my mind,what had happened? Where did it go wrong? Why didn't I understand?And you know, the extraordinary part of itis I just simply had no answers.I had lost my belief.Look where my belief had brought me to.And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see.I was crumpled.And then I remember thinking about that eye specialistasking me, "What do you want to be? What do you want to be?What did you want to be when you were little? Do you love what you do?Do something different. What do you want to be?Do something different. What do you want to be?"And really slowly, slowly, slowly,it happened.And it did happen this way.And then the minute it came,it blew up in my headand bashed in my heart --something different."Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'?You don't get more different than that."And the moment, and I mean the moment,the moment that hit me,I swear to God,it was like woo hoo! You know -- something to believe in.And nobody can tell me no.Yes, you can say I can't be an archeologist.But you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what?Nobody's ever done it before, so I'm going to go do it.And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot.And so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home.And I sprinted home, and I didn't fall, and I didn't crash.And I ran up the stairs, and there was one of my favorite books of all time,"Travels on My Elephant" by Mark Shand -- I don't know if any of you know it.And I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couchgoing, "I know what I'm going to do.I know how to be Mowgli.I'm going to go across Indiaon the back of an elephant.I'm going to be an elephant handler."And I had no ideahow I was going to be an elephant handler.From global management consultant to elephant handler.I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant.I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue.But I knew I would.Because, when you make a decision at the right time and the right place,God, that universe makes it happen for you.Nine months later, after that day on snot rock,I had the only blind date in my lifewith a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi.And together we would trek a thousand kilometersacross India.(Applause)The most powerful thing of all,it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did.But you know, I was believing in the wrong thing.Because I wasn't believing in me,really me, all the bits of me --all the bits of all of us.Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not?And you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you,it's extraordinary what happens.And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers,it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations.Six thousand people got to see because of that.When I came home off that elephant,do you know what the most amazing part was?I chucked in my job at Accenture.I left, and I became a social entrepreneur,and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family,which deals with Asian elephant conservation.And I set up Kanchi,because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant,because disability is like the elephant in the room.And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way --no charity, no pity.But I wanted to work only and trulywith business and media leadershipto totally reframe disabilityin a way that was exciting and possible.It was extraordinary.That's what I wanted to do.And I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing,or any of that kind of nothing.It just seemed that it was possible.And you know, the oddest part is,when I was on my way traveling here to TED,I'll be honest, I was petrified.And I speak,but this is an amazing audience,and what am I doing here?But as I was traveling here,you'll be very happy to know,I did use my white symbol stick cane,because it's really good to skip queues in the airport.And I got my way herebeing happily proud that I couldn't see.And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine,he texted me on the way over, knowing I was scared.Even though I present confident, I was scared.He said, "Be you."And so here I am.This is me, all of me.(Applause)And I have learned, you know what,cars and motorbikes and elephants,that's not freedom.Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom.And I never needed eyes to see -- never.I simply needed vision and belief.And if you truly believe --and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart --you can make change happen.And we need to make it happen,because every single one of us --woman, man, gay, straight,disabled, perfect,normal, whatever --everyone of usmust be the very best of ourselves.I no longer want anybody to be invisible.We all have to be included.And stop with the labels, the limiting.Losing of labels,because we are not jam jars.We are extraordinary, different, wonderful people.Thank you.(Applause)



morgan_spurlock_the_greatest_ted_talk_ever_sold
1967672

I have spent the past few yearsputting myself into situationsthat are usually very difficultand at the same time somewhat dangerous.I went to prison --difficult.I worked in a coal mine --dangerous.I filmed in war zones --difficult and dangerous.And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this --fun in the beginning,little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end.In fact, most of my career,I've been immersing myselfinto seemingly horrible situationsfor the whole goal of tryingto examine societal issuesin a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting,that hopefully break them down in a waythat make them entertaining and accessible to an audience.So when I knew I was coming hereto do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship,I knew I would want to do something a little different.So as some of you may or may not have heard,a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay.I sent out some Facebook messages,some Twitter messages,and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rightsto my 2011 TED Talk.(Laughter)That's right, some lucky individual, corporation,for-profit or non-profit,was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity --because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again --(Laughter)to buy the naming rightsto the talk you're watching right now,that at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of contentand didn't really give much hintas to what the subject matter would actually be.So what you were getting was this:Your name here presents:My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject isand, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face,especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.But that being said,it's a very good media opportunity.(Laughter)You know how many people watch these TED Talks?It's a lot.That's just a working title, by the way.(Laughter)So even with that caveat,I knew that someone would buy the naming rights.Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago,I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty.But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film,we examine the world of marketing, advertising.And as I said earlier,I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years,but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me,for anything as difficultor as dangerousas going into the rooms with these guys.(Laughter)You see, I had this idea for a movie.(Video) Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a filmall about product placement, marketing and advertising,where the entire film is fundedby product placement, marketing and advertising.So the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."So what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish,is branded from beginning to end --from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie,which is brand X.Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium,the Staples Center ...these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever.And so the film explores this whole idea -- (Michael Kassan: It's redundant.)It's what? (MK: It's redundant.) In perpetuity, forever?I'm a redundant person. (MK: I'm just saying.)That was more for emphasis.It was, "In perpetuity. Forever."But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor,but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...the greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."Xavier Kochhar: So the idea is,beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life,but actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.)MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.The goal of this whole film is transparency.You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie.So that's the whole concept,the whole film, start to finish.And I would love for CEG to help make it happen.Robert Friedman: You know it's funny,because when I first hear it,it is the ultimate respectfor an audience.Guy: I don't know how receptivepeople are going to be to it, though.XK: Do you have a perspective --I don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation --but do you know how this is going to play out? (MS: No idea.)David Cohn: How much money does it take to do this?MS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.)John Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them,but I think it's certainly worth pursuinga couple big, really obvious brands.XK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out,we look like a bunch of blithering idiots.MS: What do you think the response is going to be?Stuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be "no."MS: But is it a tough sell because of the filmor a tough sell because of me?JK: Both.MS: ... Meaning not so optimistic.So, sir, can you help me? I need help.MK: I can help you.MS: Okay. (MK: Good.)Awesome.MK: We've gotta figure out which brands.MS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.)When you look at the people you deal with ..MK: We've got some places we can go. (MS: Okay.)Turn the camera off.MS: I thought "Turn the camera off"meant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation."Turns out it really means,"We want nothing to do with your movie."MS: And just like that, one by one,all of these companies suddenly disappeared.None of them wanted anything to do with this movie.I was amazed.They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising,was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible,to get as many people to see it as possible.Especially in today's world,this intersection of new media and old mediaand the fractured media landscape,isn't the idea to getthat new buzz-worthy delivery vehiclethat's going to get that message to the masses?No, that's what I thought.But the problem was, you see,my idea had one fatal flaw,and that flaw was this.Actually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever.That wouldn't have been a problem at all.This would have been fine.But what this image represents was the problem.See, when you do a Google image search for transparency,this is ---(Laughter)(Applause)This is one of the first images that comes up.So I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin. No.(Laughter)This is was the problem: transparency --free from pretense or deceit;easily detected or seen through;readily understood;characterized by visibility or accessibility of information,especially concerning business practices --that last line being probably the biggest problem.You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days.Our politicians say it, our president says it,even our CEO's say it.But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality,something suddenly changes.But why? Well, transparency is scary --(Roar)like that odd, still-screaming bear.(Laughter)It's unpredictable --(Music)(Laughter)like this odd country road.And it's also very risky.(Laughter)What else is risky?Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip.(Laughter)That's very risky.Now when I started talking to companiesand telling them that we wanted to tell this story,and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.We want you to tell a story,but we just want to tell our story."See, when I was a kidand my father would catch me in some sort of a lie --and there he is giving me the look he often gave me --he would say, "Son, there's three sides to every story.There's your story,there's my storyand there's the real story."Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.But with only one company, one agency willing to help me --and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years --I realized that I would have to go on my own,I'd have to cut out the middlemanand go to the companies myself with all of my team.So what you suddenly started to realize --or what I started to realize --is that when you started having conversations with these companies,the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.(Video) MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films,and I have friends who make little independent films like I make.And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood moviessay the reason their films are so successfulis because of the brand partners that they have.And then my friends who make small independent filmssay, "Well, how are we supposed to competewith these big, giant Hollywood movies?"And the movie is called"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."So how specifically will we see Ban in the film?Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet,you will see Ban deodorant.While anytime I do an interview with someone,I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview?Are you ready? You look a little nervous.I want to help you calm down.So maybe you should put some one before the interview."So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents.Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds,"they'll have their chance.We will have them geared for both male or female --solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be.That's the two-cent tour.So now I can answer any of your questionsand give you the five-cent tour.Karen Frank: We are a smaller brand.Much like you talked about being a smaller movie,we're very much a challenger brand.So we don't have the budgets that other brands have.So doing things like this -- you know,remind people about Ban --is kind of why were interested in it.MS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban?Ban is blank.KF: That's a great question.(Laughter)Woman: Superior technology.MS: Technology's not the way you want to describe somethingsomebody's putting in their armpit.Man: We talk about bold, fresh.I think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive,versus "fights odor and wetness."It keeps you fresh.How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness,more freshness, three times fresher.Things like that that are more of that positive benefit.MS: And that's a multi-million dollar corporation.What about me? What about a regular guy?I need to go talk to the man on the street,the people who are like me, the regular Joes.They need to tell me about my brand.(Video) MS: How would you guys describe your brand?Man: Um, my brand?I don't know.I like really nice clothes.Woman: 80's revivalmeets skater-punk,unless it's laundry day.MS: All right, what is brand Gerry?Gerry: Unique. (MS: Unique.)Man: I guess what kind of genre, style I amwould be like dark glamor.I like a lot of black colors,a lot of grays and stuff like that.But usually I have an accessory,like sunglasses,or I like crystal and things like that too.Woman: If Dan were a brand,he might be a classic convertibleMercedes Benz.Man 2: The brand that I amis, I would call it casual fly.Woman 2: Part hippie, part yogi,part Brooklyn girl -- I don't know.Man 3: I'm the pet guy.I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world.So I guess that's my brand.In my warped little industry, that's my brand.Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods.Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand.Is that something?Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand.Tom: I'm Tom.MS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myselfat the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly.(Laughter)And what I realized is I needed an expert.I needed somebody who could get inside my head,somebody who could really help me understandwhat they call your "brand personality."And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmarkdiscover that brand personality.If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.(Video) Abigail: You brought your pictures, right?MS: I did. The very first pictureis a picture of my family.A: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are.MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.A: Tell me about this world.MS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in --like people who are around you, your friends, your family,the way you live your life, the job you do.All those things stemmed and started from one place,and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia.A: What's the next one you want to talk about?MS: The next one: This was the best day ever.A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are?MS: It's like, who do I want to be?I like things that are different.I like things that are weird. I like weird things.A: Tell me about the "why" phase -- what does that do for us?What is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now?Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent?Tell me a little bit about that part.... A little more about you that is not who you are.What are some other metamorphoses that you've had?... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on?MS: EEEEEE! (A: Thank you.) No, thank you.A: Thanks for you patience. (MS: Great job.)A: Yeah. (MS: Thanks a lot.) All right.MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this.There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.Lindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this ideathat you had two distinct, but complementarysides to your brand personality --the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand.Those are juxtaposed very nicely together.And I think there's almost a paradox with those.And I think some companieswill just focus on one of their strengths or the otherinstead of focusing on both.Most companies tend to -- and it's human nature --to avoid things that they're not sure of,avoid fear, those elements,and you really embrace those,and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see.What other brands are like that?The first on here is the classic, Apple.And you can see here too, Target, Wii,Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.Now there's playful brands and mindful brands,those things that have come and gone,but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing.MS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand?If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality,what would you be?Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing?Or are you more of a down attribute?Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative?Up attributes are things like being playful,being fresh like the Fresh Prince,contemporary, adventurous,edgy or daring like Errol Flynn,nimble or agile, profane, domineering,magical or mystical like Gandalf.Or are you more of a down attribute?Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007?Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective,empathetic like the Oprah?Are you reliable, stable, familiar,safe, secure, sacred,contemplative or wiselike the Dalai Lama or Yoda?Over the course of this film,we had 500-plus companieswho were up and down companiessaying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project.They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control,they would have no control over the final product.But we did get 17 brand partnerswho were willing to relinquish that control,who wanted to be in businesswith someone as mindful and as playful as myselfand who ultimately empowered us to tell storiesthat normally we wouldn't be able to tell --stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind.They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing,as we got into telling the story in this filmabout how now they're using MRI'sto target the desire centers of your brainfor both commercials as well as movie marketing.We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.In the entire city for the past five years,there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing.(Applause)And we went to school districtswhere now companies are making their wayinto cash-strapped schools all across America.What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of,or I've had the most success in,are ones where I've interacted with things directly.And that's what these brands did.They cut out the middleman, they cut out their agenciesand said, "Maybe these agenciesdon't have my best interest in mind.I'm going to deal directly with the artist.I'm going to work with him to create something different,something that's going to get people thinking,that's going to challenge the way we look at the world."And how has that been for them? Has it been successful?Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look.According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January,and since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing --we've had 900 million media impressions for this film.That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.That's only online -- no print, no TV.The film hasn't even been distributed yet.It's not even online. It's not even streaming.It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.So ultimately,this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked toadvised their clients not to take part.What I always believeis that if you take chances, if you take risks,that in those risks will come opportunity.I believe that when you push people away from that,you're pushing them more towards failure.I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse,then you're preparing your whole companyto be reward challenged.I feel like that what has to happen moving forwardis we need to encourage people to take risks.We need to encourage people to not be afraidof opportunities that may scare them.Ultimately, moving forward,I think we have to embrace fear.We've got to put that bear in a cage.(Laughter)Embrace fear. Embrace risk.One big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk.And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency.Today, more than ever,a little honesty is going to go a long way.And that being said, through honesty and transparency,my entire talk, "Embrace Transparency,"has been brought to youby my good friends at EMC,who for $7,100bought the naming rights on eBay.(Applause)EMC: Turning big datainto big opportunityfor organizations all over the world.EMC presents: "Embrace Transparency."Thank you very much, guys.(Applause)June Cohen: So, Morgan,in the name of transparency,what exactly happened to that $7,100?MS: That is a fantastic question.I have in my pocket a checkmade out to the parent organization to the TED organization,the Sapling Foundation --a check for $7,100to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED.(Laughter)(Applause)

So what does the happiest man in the world look like?He certainly doesn't look like me.He looks like this.His name is Matthieu Ricard.So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?Well it turns outthere is a way to measure happiness in the brain.And you do that by measuring the relative activationof the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI,versus the right prefrontal cortex.And Matthieu's happiness measureis off the charts.He's by far the happiest manever measured by science.Which leads us to a question:What was he thinking when he was being measured?Perhaps something very naughty.(Laughter)Actually, he was meditatingon compassion.Matthieu's own experienceis that compassion is the happiest state ever.Reading about Matthieuwas one of the pivotal moments of my life.My dreamis to create the conditionsfor world peace in my lifetime --and to do thatby creating the conditionsfor inner peaceand compassionon a global scale.And learning about Matthieugave me a new angle to look at my work.Matthieu's brain scan showsthat compassion is not a chore.Compassion is something that creates happiness.Compassion is fun.And that mind-blowing insightchanges the entire game.Because if compassion was a chore,nobody's going to do it,except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.But if compassion was fun,everybody's going to do it.Therefore,to create the conditions for global compassion,all we have to dois to reframe compassionas something that is fun.But fun is not enough.What if compassionis also profitable?What if compassion is also good for business?Then, every boss, every manager in the world,will want to have compassion --like this.That would create the conditionsfor world peace.So, I started paying attentionto what compassion looks like in a business setting.Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far.Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes --in Google, my company.I know there are other compassionate companies in the world,but Google is the place I'm familiar withbecause I've been there for 10 years,so I'll use Google as the case study.Google is a companyborn of idealism.It's a company that thrives on idealism.And maybe because of that,compassion is organicand widespread company-wide.In Google, expressions of corporate compassionalmost always follow the same pattern.It's sort of a funny pattern.It starts with a small group of Googlerstaking the initiative to do something.And they don't usually ask for permission;they just go ahead and do it,and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.And sometimes it gets big enoughto become official.So in other words,it almost always starts from the bottom up.And let me give you some examples.The first example is the largest annual community event --where Googlers from around the worlddonate their labor to their local communities --was initiated and organizedby three employeesbefore it became official,because it just became too big.Another example, three Googlers --a chef, an engineerand, most funny, a massage therapist --three of them, they learned about a region in Indiawhere 200,000 people livewithout a single medical facility.So what do they do?They just go ahead and start a fundraiser.And they raise enough money to build this hospital --the first hospital of its kindfor 200,000 people.During the Haiti earthquake,a number of engineers and product managersspontaneously came togetherand stayed overnightto build a toolto allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.And expressions of compassionare also found in our international offices.In China for example,one mid-level employeeinitiated the largest social action competition in China,involving more than 1,000 schools in China,working on issuessuch as education, poverty,health care and the environment.There is so much organic social actionall around Googlethat the company decided to forma social responsibility teamjust to support these efforts.And this idea, again,came from the grassroots,from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptionsand volunteered themselves for the job.And I found it fascinatingthat the social responsibility teamwas not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.It was two persons saying, "Let's do this,"and the company said, "Yes."So it turns outthat Google is a compassionate company,because Googlers foundcompassion to be fun.But again, fun is not enough.There are also real business benefits.So what are they?The first benefit of compassionis that it creates highly effective business leaders.What does that mean?There are three components of compassion.There is the affective component,which is, "I feel for you."There is the cognitive component,which is, "I understand you."And there is a motivational component,which is, "I want to help you."So what has this got to do with business leadership?According to a very comprehensive studyled by Jim Collins,and documented in the book "Good to Great,"it takes a very special kind of leaderto bring a companyfrom goodness to greatness.And he calls them "Level 5 leaders."These are leaderswho, in addition to being highly capable,possess two important qualities,and they arehumility and ambition.These are leaderswho are highly ambitious for the greater good.And because they're ambitious for a greater good,they feel no need to inflate their own egos.And they, according to the research,make the best business leaders.And if you look at these qualitiesin the context of compassion,we findthat the cognitive and affective components of compassion --understanding people and empathizing with people --inhibits, tones down,what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us,therefore creating the conditionsfor humility.The motivational component of compassioncreates ambition for greater good.In other words,compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.And this is the first compelling business benefit.The second compelling benefit of compassionis that it creates an inspiring workforce.Employees mutually inspire each othertowards greater good.It creates a vibrant, energetic communitywhere people admire and respect each other.I mean, you come to work in the morning,and you work with three guyswho just up and decide to build a hospital in India.It's like how can you not be inspired by those people --your own coworkers?So this mutual inspirationpromotes collaboration,initiative and creativity.It makes us a highly effective company.So, having said all that,what is the secret formulafor brewing compassionin the corporate setting?In our experience,there are three ingredients.The first ingredientis to create a cultureof passionate concernfor the greater good.So always think:how is your company and your jobserving the greater good?Or, how can you further servethe greater good?This awareness of serving the greater goodis very self-inspiringand it creates fertile groundfor compassion to grow in.That's one.The second ingredientis autonomy.So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.And one of our most popular managers jokes that,this is what he says,"Google is a placewhere the inmates run the asylum."And he considers himself one of the inmates.If you already havea culture of compassionand idealismand you let your people roam free,they will do the right thingin the most compassionate way.The third ingredientis to focus on inner developmentand personal growth.Leadership training in Google, for example,places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities,such as self-awareness, self-mastery,empathy and compassion,because we believethat leadership beginswith character.We even created a seven-week curriculumon emotion intelligence,which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself."It's less naughty than it sounds.So I'm an engineer by training,but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course,which I find kind of funny,because this is a company that trusts an engineerto teach emotion intelligence.What a company.(Laughter)So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work?It works in three steps.The first stepis attention training.Attention is the basisof all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.Therefore, any curriculumfor training emotion intelligencehas to begin with attention training.The idea here is to train attentionto create a quality of mindthat is calm and clearat the same time.And this creates the foundationfor emotion intelligence.The second step follows the first step.The second step is developing self-knowledgeand self-mastery.So using the supercharged attention from step one,we create a high-resolution perceptioninto the cognitive and emotive processes.What does that mean?It means being able to observe our thought streamand the process of emotionwith high clarity,objectivityand from a third-person perspective.And once you can do that,you create the kind of self-knowledgethat enables self-mastery.The third step, following the second step,is to create new mental habits.What does that mean? Imagine this.Imagine whenever you meet any other person,any time you meet a person,your habitual, instinctive first thoughtis, "I want you to be happy.I want you to be happy."Imagine you can do that.Having this habit, this mental habit,changes everything at work.Because this good willis unconsciously picked up by other people,and it creates trust,and trust creates a lot of good working relationships.And this also creates the conditionsfor compassion in the workplace.Someday, we hope to open-source"Search Inside Yourself"so that everybody in the corporate worldwill at least be able to use it as a reference.And in closing,I want to end the same place I started,with happiness.I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy --the Dalai Lama,who said, "If you want others to be happy,practice compassion.If you want to be happy,practice compassion."I found this to be true,both on the individual leveland at a corporate level.And I hope that compassionwill be both fun and profitable for you too.Thank you.(Applause)

As a boy,I loved cars.When I turned 18,I lost my best friend to a car accident.Like this.And then I decided I'd dedicate my lifeto saving one million peopleevery year.Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report,but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.I saw the concept firstin the DARPA Grand Challengeswhere the U.S. government issued a prizeto build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.And even though a hundred teams were there,these cars went nowhere.So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.We built the hardware and the software.We made it learn from us,and we set it free in the desert.And the unimaginable happened:it became the first carto ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge,winning Stanford 2 million dollars.Yet I still hadn't saved a single life.Since, our work has focusedon building driving carsthat can drive anywhere by themselves --any street in California.We've driven 140,000 miles.Our cars have sensorsby which they magically can seeeverything around themand make decisionsabout every aspect of driving.It's the perfect driving mechanism.We've driven in cities,like in San Francisco here.We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.We've encountered joggers,busy highways, toll booths,and this is without a person in the loop;the car just drives itself.In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles,people didn't even notice.Mountain roads,day and night,and even crooked Lombard Streetin San Francisco.(Laughter)Sometimes our cars get so crazy,they even do little stunts.(Video) Man: Oh, my God.What?Second Man: It's driving itself.Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,but I can do something for all the people who died.Do you know that driving accidentsare the number one cause of death for young people?And do you realize that almost all of thoseare due to human errorand not machine error,and can therefore be prevented by machines?Do you realizethat we could change the capacity of highwaysby a factor of two or threeif we didn't rely on human precisionon staying in the lane --improve body positionand therefore drive a little bit closer togetheron a little bit narrower lanes,and do away with all traffic jams on highways?Do you realize that you, TED users,spend an averageof 52 minutes per dayin traffic,wasting your timeon your daily commute?You could regain this time.This is four billion hourswasted in this country alone.And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology,and I'm really looking forward to a timewhen generations after us look back at usand say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.Thank you.(Applause)

This is a river.This is a stream.This is a river.This is happening all over the country.They're the veins of the ecosystem,and they're often empty veins.This is Prickly Pear Creek.it looked like this in the summer.How did we get here?Well, it started back in the late 1800sand the folks who were there firstboth involving Prickly Pear Creek.And in 1921,These senior water rights are key.Some of these creeks have claimsthey risk losing their water right --So they have no incentive to conserve.we still have this.It's a broken system.There's a disincentive to conserve,OK, now I'm going to change gears here.(Laughter)(Laughter)about their water footprint.affects the image of their brand.Well, it's a national problem,and it involves beer.to make a pint of beer.If you include all the drain,Now the brewers in MontanaI mean, there's water in beer.These ecosystems are really important(Laughter)Remember Prickly Pear.Up until now, business water stewardshipRemember Prickly Pear.It's a broken system.You've got a disincentive to conserve,and the world of the farmersIn some states,while legally protecting it from others,and maintaining their water right.After all, it is their water right,it's their right to do so.But they have no incentive to do so.That's what's happening here.leaving the water in the stream.He doesn't lose the water right,to the stream, instead of to the land.OK?We then take the measured water,while giving farmers an economic choicean easy way to deal with them.into these degraded ecosystems,about how their water is used.And most importantly, it's working.with brewers in Montana,with hotels and tea companies in Oregon,And when we make these connections,we can and we do turn this ...into this.(Applause)Thank you very much.(Applause)



noreena_hertz_how_to_use_experts_and_when_not_to

It's Monday morning.In Washington,the president of the United Statesis sitting in the Oval Office,assessing whether or notto strike Al Qaedain Yemen.At Number 10 Downing Street,David Cameron is trying to work outwhether to cut more public sector jobsin order to stave off a double-dip recession.In Madrid, Maria Gonzalezis standing at the door,listening to her baby crying and crying,trying to work out whether she should let it cryuntil it falls asleepor pick it up and hold it.And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital,trying to work outwhether I should let him drinkthe one-and-a-half-liter bottle of waterthat his doctors just came in and said,"You must make him drink today," --my father's been nil by mouth for a week --or whether, by giving him this bottle,I might actually kill him.We face momentous decisionswith important consequencesthroughout our lives,and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.We talk things over with our friends,we scour the Internet,we search through books.But still,even in this ageof Google and TripAdvisorand Amazon Recommends,it's still expertsthat we rely upon most --especially when the stakes are highand the decision really matters.Because in a world of data delugeand extreme complexity,we believe that expertsare more able to process information than we can --that they are able to come to better conclusionsthan we could come to on our own.And in an agethat is sometimes nowadays frighteningor confusing,we feel reassuredby the almost parental-like authorityof expertswho tell us so clearly what it iswe can and cannot do.But I believethat this is a big problem,a problem with potentially dangerous consequencesfor us as a society,as a cultureand as individuals.It's not that expertshave not massively contributed to the world --of course they have.The problem lies with us:we've become addicted to experts.We've become addicted to their certainty,their assuredness,their definitiveness,and in the process,we have ceded our responsibility,substituting our intellectand our intelligencefor their supposed words of wisdom.We've surrendered our power,trading off our discomfortwith uncertaintyfor the illusion of certaintythat they provide.This is no exaggeration.In a recent experiment,a group of adultshad their brains scanned in an MRI machineas they were listening to experts speak.The results were quite extraordinary.As they listened to the experts' voices,the independent decision-making parts of their brainsswitched off.It literally flat-lined.And they listened to whatever the experts saidand took their advice, however right or wrong.But experts do get things wrong.Did you know that studies showthat doctors misdiagnosefour times out of 10?Did you knowthat if you file your tax returns yourself,you're statistically more likelyto be filing them correctlythan if you get a tax adviserto do it for you?And then there's, of course, the examplethat we're all too aware of:financial expertsgetting it so wrongthat we're living through the worst recessionsince the 1930s.For the sake of our health,our wealthand our collective security,it's imperative that we keepthe independent decision-making parts of our brainsswitched on.And I'm saying this as an economistwho, over the past few years,has focused my researchon what it is we thinkand who it is we trust and why,but also --and I'm aware of the irony here --as an expert myself,as a professor,as somebody who advises prime ministers,heads of big companies,international organizations,but an expert who believesthat the role of experts needs to change,that we need to become more open-minded,more democraticand be more opento people rebelling againstour points of view.So in order to help you understandwhere I'm coming from,let me bring you into my world,the world of experts.Now there are, of course, exceptions,wonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions.But what my research has shown meis that experts tend on the wholeto form very rigid camps,that within these camps,a dominant perspective emergesthat often silences opposition,that experts move with the prevailing winds,often hero-worshippingtheir own gurus.Alan Greenspan's proclamationsthat the years of economic growthwould go on and on,not challenged by his peers,until after the crisis, of course.You see,we also learnthat experts are located,are governed,by the social and cultural normsof their times --whether it be the doctorsin Victorian England, say,who sent women to asylumsfor expressing sexual desire,or the psychiatrists in the United Stateswho, up until 1973,were still categorizing homosexualityas a mental illness.And what all this meansis that paradigmstake far too long to shift,that complexity and nuance are ignoredand also that money talks --because we've all seen the evidenceof pharmaceutical companiesfunding studies of drugsthat conveniently leave outtheir worst side effects,or studies funded by food companiesof their new products,massively exaggerating the health benefitsof the products they're about to bring by market.The study showed that food companies exaggeratedtypically seven times morethan an independent study.And we've also got to be awarethat experts, of course,also make mistakes.They make mistakes every single day --mistakes born out of carelessness.A recent study in the Archives of Surgeryreported surgeonsremoving healthy ovaries,operating on the wrong side of the brain,carrying out procedures on the wrong hand,elbow, eye, foot,and also mistakes born out of thinking errors.A common thinking errorof radiologists, for example --when they look at CT scans --is that they're overly influencedby whatever it isthat the referring physician has saidthat he suspectsthe patient's problem to be.So if a radiologistis looking at the scanof a patient with suspected pneumonia, say,what happens is that,if they see evidenceof pneumonia on the scan,they literally stop looking at it --thereby missing the tumorsitting three inches belowon the patient's lungs.I've shared with you so farsome insights into the world of experts.These are, of course,not the only insights I could share,but I hope they give you a clear sense at leastof why we need to stop kowtowing to them,why we need to rebeland why we need to switchour independent decision-making capabilities on.But how can we do this?Well for the sake of time,I want to focus on just three strategies.First, we've got to be ready and willingto take experts onand dispense with this notion of themas modern-day apostles.This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.in every single subject,you'll be relieved to hear.But it does mean persistingin the face of their inevitable annoyancewhen, for example,we want them to explain things to usin language that we can actually understand.Why was it that, when I had an operation,my doctor said to me,"Beware, Ms. Hertz,of hyperpyrexia,"when he could have just as easily said,"Watch out for a high fever."You see, being ready to take experts onis about also being willingto dig behind their graphs,their equations, their forecasts,their prophecies,and being armed with the questions to do that --questions like:What are the assumptions that underpin this?What is the evidence upon which this is based?What has your investigation focused on?And what has it ignored?It recently came outthat experts trialing drugsbefore they come to markettypically trial drugsfirst, primarily on male animalsand then, primarily on men.It seems that they've somehow overlooked the factthat over half the world's population are women.And women have drawn the short medical strawbecause it now turns out that many of these drugsdon't work nearly as well on womenas they do on men --and the drugs that do work well work so wellthat they're actively harmful for women to take.Being a rebel is about recognizingthat experts' assumptionsand their methodologiescan easily be flawed.Second,we need to create the spacefor what I call "managed dissent."If we are to shift paradigms,if we are to make breakthroughs,if we are to destroy myths,we need to create an environmentin which expert ideas are battling it out,in which we're bringing innew, diverse, discordant, heretical viewsinto the discussion,fearlessly,in the knowledge that progress comes about,not only from the creation of ideas,but also from their destruction --and also from the knowledgethat, by surrounding ourselvesby divergent, discordant,heretical views.All the research now shows usthat this actually makes us smarter.Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notionbecause it goes against our very instincts,which are to surround ourselveswith opinions and advicethat we already believeor want to be true.And that's why I talk about the needto actively manage dissent.Google CEO Eric Schmidtis a practical practitionerof this philosophy.In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room --arms crossed, looking a bit bemused --and draws them into the discussion,trying to see if they indeed arethe person with a different opinion,so that they have dissent within the room.Managing dissentis about recognizing the valueof disagreement, discordand difference.But we need to go even further.We need to fundamentally redefinewho it is that experts are.The conventional notionis that experts are peoplewith advanced degrees,fancy titles, diplomas,best-selling books --high-status individuals.But just imagineif we were to junkthis notion of expertiseas some sort of elite cadreand instead embrace the notionof democratized expertise --whereby expertise was not just the preserveof surgeons and CEO's,but also shop-girls -- yeah.Best Buy,the consumer electronics company,gets all its employees --the cleaners, the shop assistants,the people in the back office,not just its forecasting team --to place bets, yes bets,on things like whether or nota product is going to sell well before Christmas,on whether customers' new ideasare going to be or should be taken on by the company,on whether a projectwill come in on time.By leveragingand by embracingthe expertise within the company,Best Buy was able to discover, for example,that the store that it was going to open in China --its big, grand store --was not going to open on time.Because when it asked its staff,all its staff, to place their betson whether they thought the store would open on time or not,a group from the finance departmentplaced all their chipson that not happening.It turned out that they were aware,as no one else within the company was,of a technological blipthat neither the forecasting experts,nor the experts on the ground in China,were even aware of.The strategiesthat I have discussed this evening --embracing dissent,taking experts on,democratizing expertise,rebellious strategies --are strategies that I thinkwould serve us all well to embraceas we try to deal with the challengesof these very confusing, complex,difficult times.For if we keepour independent decision-making partof our brains switched on,if we challenge experts, if we're skeptical,if we devolve authority,if we are rebellious,but alsoif we become much more comfortablewith nuance,uncertainty and doubt,and if we allow our expertsto express themselvesusing those terms too,we will set ourselves upmuch betterfor the challenges of the 21st century.For now, more than ever,is not the timeto be blindly following,blindly accepting,blindly trusting.Now is the time to face the worldwith eyes wide open --yes, using expertsto help us figure things out, for sure --I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here --but being awareof their limitationsand, of course, also our own.Thank you.(Applause)

Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin?Madeleine Albright: This is "Breaking the Glass Ceiling."PM: Oh.That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen.MA: Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morningis trying to figure out what is going to happen.And none of this pin stuff would have happenedif it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein.I'll tell you what happened.I went to the United Nations as an ambassador,and it was after the Gulf War,and I was an instructed ambassador.And the cease-fire had been translatedinto a series of sanctions resolutions,and my instructionswere to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly,which he deserved -- he had invaded another country.And so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdadcomparing me to many things,but among them an "unparalleled serpent."And so I happened to have a snake pin.So I wore it when we talked about Iraq.(Laughter)And when I went out to meet the press,they zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?"I said, "Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent."And then I thought, well this is fun.So I went out and I bought a lot of pinsthat would, in fact, reflectwhat I thought we were going to do on any given day.So that's how it all started.PM: So how large is the collection?MA: Pretty big.It's now traveling.At the moment it's in Indianapolis,but it was at the Smithsonian.And it goes with a book that says, "Read My Pins."(Laughter)PM: So is this a good idea.I remember when you were the first womanas Secretary of State,and there was a lot of conversation alwaysabout what you were wearing,how you looked --the thing that happens to a lot of women,especially if they're the first in a position.So how do you feel about that -- the whole --MA: Well, it's pretty irritating actuallybecause nobody ever describes what a man is wearing.But people did pay attention to what clothes I had.What was interesting was that,before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador,I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me,and she said, "You've got to get rid of your professor clothes.Go out and look like a diplomat."So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping.But still, there were all kinds of questionsabout -- "did you wear a hat?" "How short was your skirt?"And one of the things --if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots,and she got criticized over that.And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it.PM: It is, for all of us, men and women,finding our ways of defining our roles,and doing them in ways that make a difference in the worldand shape the future.How did you handle that balancebetween being the tough diplomaticand strong voice of this countryto the rest of the worldand also how you felt about yourselfas a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ...and so how did you handle that?MA: Well the interesting part was I was askedwhat it was like to be the first woman Secretary of Statea few minutes after I'd been named.And I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years,but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes."So it evolved.(Laughter)But basically I love being a woman.And so what happened --and I think there will probably be some people in the audiencethat will identify with this --I went to my first meeting, first at the U.N.,and that's when this all started,because that is a very male organization.And I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council --so 14 men sat there staring at me,and I thought -- well you know how we all are.You want to get the feeling of the room,and "do people like me?"and "will I really say something intelligent?"And all of a sudden I thought, "Well, wait a minute.I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,'and if I don't speak todaythen the voice of the United States will not be heard,"and it was the first time that I had that feelingthat I had to step out of myselfin my normal, reluctant female modeand decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country.And so that happened more at various times,but I really think that there was a great advantage in many waysto being a woman.I think we are a lot betterat personal relationships,and then have the capability obviouslyof telling it like it is when it's necessary.But I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter,when she turned seven last year,said to her mother, my daughter,"So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State?Only girls are Secretary of State."(Laughter)(Applause)PM: Because in her lifetime -- MA: That would be so.PM: What a change that is.As you travel now all over the world,which you do frequently,how do you assessthis global narrative around the story of women and girls?Where are we?MA: I think we're slowly changing,but obviously there are whole pocketsin countries where nothing is different.And therefore it means that we have to rememberthat, while many of us have had huge opportunities --and Pat, you have been a real leader in your field --is that there are a lot of womenthat are not capableof worrying and taking care of themselvesand understanding that women have to help other women.And so what I have felt --and I have looked at thisfrom a national security issue --when I was Secretary of State, I decidedthat women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy,not just because I'm a feminist,but because I believe that societies are better offwhen women are politically and economically empowered,that values are passed down,the health situation is better,education is better,there is greater economic prosperity.So I think that it behooves us --those of us that live in various countrieswhere we do have economic and political voice --that we need to help other women.And I really dedicated myself to that,both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.PM: And did you get pushbackfrom making that a central tenant of foreign policy?MA: From some people.I think that they thought that it was a soft issue.The bottom line that I decidedwas actually women's issues are the hardest issues,because they are the ones that have to do with life and deathin so many aspects,and because, as I said,it is really central to the way that we think about things.Now for instance,some of the wars that took placewhen I was in office,a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.For instance, when I started,there were wars in the Balkans.The women in Bosnia were being raped.We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunalto deal specifically with those kinds of issues.And by the way, one of the things that I did at that stagewas, I had just arrived at the U.N.,and when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N.Now there are 192.But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself.So I said to my assistant,"Invite the other women permanent representatives."And I thought when I'd get to my apartmentthat there'd be a lot of women there.I get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.So the countries that had women representativeswere Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines,Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica,Lichtenstein and me.So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.(Laughter)And so we set it up,and we called ourselves the G7.(Laughter)PM: Is that "Girl 7?" MA: Girl 7.And we lobbiedon behalf of women's issues.So we managed to get two women judgeson this war crimes tribunal.And then what happenedwas that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war,that it was against humanity.(Applause)PM: So when you look around the worldand you see that, in many cases --certainly in the Western world --women are evolving into more leadership positions,and even other placessome barriers are being brought down,but there's still so much violence,still so many problems,and yet we hear there are more womenat the negotiating tables.Now you were at those negotiating tableswhen they weren't, when there was maybe you --one voice, maybe one or two others.Do you believe, and can you tell us why,there is going to be a significant shiftin things like violenceand peace and conflict and resolutionon a sustainable basis?MA: Well I do think, when there are more women,that the tone of the conversation changes,and also the goals of the conversation change.But it doesn't mean that the whole worldwould be a lot betterif it were totally run by women.If you think that, you've forgotten high school.(Laughter)But the bottom lineis that there is a way,when there are more women at the table,that there's an attemptto develop some understanding.So for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi,we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women togetherto talk about some of the problemsthat had taken place in Rwanda.And so I think the capability of womento put themselves --I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoesand having more empathy.I think it helps in terms of the supportif there are other women in the room.When I was Secretary of State,there were only 13 other women foreign ministers.And so it was nice when one of them would show up.For instance, she is now the president of Finland,but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finlandand, at a certain stage, head of the European Union.And it was really terrific.Because one of the things I think you'll understand.We went to a meeting,and the men in my delegation,when I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this,"and they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?"And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me.And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control,and she said, "Well I feel we should do this."And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.But I think it really does helpto have a critical mass of womenin a series of foreign policy positions.The other thing that I think is really important:A lot of national security policyisn't just about foreign policy,but it's about budgets, military budgets,and how the debts of countries work out.So if you have womenin a variety of foreign policy posts,they can support each otherwhen there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.PM: So how do we getthis balance we're looking for, then, in the world?More women's voices at the table?More men who believethat the balance is best?MA: Well I think one of the things --I'm chairman of the board of an organizationcalled the National Democratic Institutethat works to support women candidates.I think that we needto help in other countriesto train womento be in political office,to figure out how they can in factdevelop political voices.I think we also need to be supportivewhen businesses are being createdand just make sure that women help each other.Now I have a sayingthat I feel very strongly about,because I am of a certain agewhere, when I started in my career,believe it or not, there were other women who criticized me:"Why aren't you in the carpool line?"or "Aren't your children sufferingbecause you're not there all the time?"And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.In fact, I think "guilt" is every woman's middle name.And so I think what needs to happenis we need to help each other.And my motto is that there's a special place in hellfor women who don't help each other.(Applause)PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.Thank you for joining us today.MA: Thank you all. Thanks Pat.(Applause)



lisa_gansky_the_future_of_business_is_the_mesh

I'm speaking to you about what I call the "mesh."It's essentially a fundamental shiftin our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives.And it's starting to look at --not always and not for everything --but in certain moments of time,access to certain kinds of goods and servicewill trump ownership of them.And so it's the pursuit of better things,easily shared.And we come from a long tradition of sharing.We've shared transportation.We've shared wine and foodand other sorts of fabulous experiencesin coffee bars in Amsterdam.We've also shared other sorts of entertainment --sports arenas, public parks,concert halls, libraries,universities.All these things are share-platforms,but sharing ultimately starts and endswith what I refer toas the "mother of all share-platforms."And as I think about the meshand I think about, well, what's driving it,how come it's happening now,I think there's a number of vectorsthat I want to give you as background.One is the recession --that the recession has caused usto rethink our relationshipwith the things in our lives relative to the value --so starting to align the valuewith the true cost.Secondly, population growthand density into cities.More people, smaller spaces,less stuff.Climate change:we're trying to reduce the stressin our personal lives and in our communitiesand on the planet.Also, there's been this recent distrustof big brands, global big brands,in a bunch of different industries,and that's created an opening.Research is showing here, in the States,and in Canada and Western Europe,that most of us are much more opento local companies,or brands that maybe we haven't heard of.Whereas before, we went with the big brandsthat we were sure we trusted.And last is thatwe're more connected now to more people on the planetthan ever before --except for if you're sitting next to someone.(Laughter)The other thing that's worth consideringis that we've made a huge investmentover decades and decades,and tens of billions of dollarshave gone into this investmentthat now is our inheritance.It's a physical infrastructurethat allows us to get from point A to point Band move things that way.It's also -- Web and mobileallow us to be connectedand create all kinds of platforms and systems,and the investment of those technologiesand that infrastructureis really our inheritance.It allows us to engagein really new and interesting ways.And so for me, a mesh company, the "classic" mesh company,brings together these three things:our ability to connect to each other --most of us are walking around with these mobile devicesthat are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled --allows us to find each otherand find things in time and space.And third is that physical thingsare readable on a map --so restaurants, a variety of venues,but also with GPS and other technologylike RFIDand it continues to expand beyond that,we can also track things that are moving,like a car, a taxicab, a transit system,a box that's moving through time and space.And so that sets upfor making access to get goods and servicesmore convenient and less costly in many casesthan owning them.For example, I want to use Zipcar.How many people here have experiencedcar-sharing or bike-sharing?Wow, that's great. Okay, thank you.Basically Zipcaris the largest car-sharing company in the world.They did not invent car-sharing.Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe.One of the founders went to Switzerland,saw it implemented someplace,said, "Wow, that looks really cool.I think we can do that in Cambridge,"brought it to Cambridgeand they started -- two women --Robin Chase being the other person who started it.Zipcar got some really important things right.First, they really understoodthat a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.And so they were very cleverabout the way that they packaged car-sharing.They made it sexy. They made it fresh.They made it aspirational.If you were a member of the club,when you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster.The cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop carsthat were hollowed out or something.They picked these sexy cars.They targeted to universities.They made sure that the demographicfor who they were targeting and the car was all matching.It was a very nice experience,and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.But they understood fundamentallythat they are not a car company.They understand that they are an information company.Because when we buy a carwe go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow --usually as quickly as possible.But when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service,you might use an E.V. to commute,you get a truck because you're doing a home project.When you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.And you're going to the mountains to ski,you get different accessories put on the carfor doing that sort of thing.Meanwhile, these guys are sitting back,collecting all sorts of dataabout our behavior and how we interact with the service.And so it's not only an option for them,but I believe it's an imperativefor Zipcar and other mesh companiesto actually just wow us,to be like a concierge service.Because we give them so much information,and they are entitled to really seehow it is that we're moving.They're in really good shape to anticipatewhat we're going to want next.And so what percent of the daydo you think the average person uses a car?What percentage of the time?Any guesses?Those are really very good.I was imagining it was like20 percent when I first started.The number across the U.S. and Western Europeis eight percent.And so basically even if you think it's 10 percent,90 percent of the time,something that costs us a lot of money --personally, and also we organize our cities around itand all sorts of things --90 percent of the time it's sitting around.So for this reason,I think one of the other themes with the meshis essentially that, if we squeeze hardon things that we've thrown away,there's a lot of value in those things.What set up with Zipcar -- Zipcar started in 2000.In the last year, 2010,two car companies started,one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar,and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services,because the two things that really work for car-sharingis, one, the car has to be available,and two, it's within one or two blocksof where you stand.Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your officeis probably your neighbor's car,and it's probably also available.So people have created this business.Zipcar started a decade earlier,in 2000.It took them six yearsto get 1,000 cars in service.WhipCar, which started April of last year,it took them six monthsto get 1,000 cars in the service.So, really interesting.People are making anywhere between200 and 700 dollars a monthletting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it.So it's like vacation rentals for cars.Since I'm here --and I hope some people in the audienceare in the car business --(Laughter)-- I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things --we saw cable-ready TVsand WiFi-ready Notebooks --it would be really great if, any minute now,you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.Because it just creates more flexibility.It allows us as owners to have other options.And I think we're going there anyway.The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses --and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflixthat are full mesh businesses,or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies,car manufacturers,who are beginning to offertheir own car-share servicesas well as a second flanker brand,or as really a test, I think --is to make sharing irresistible.We have experiences in our lives, certainly,when sharing has been irresistible.It's just, how do we make that recurrentand scale it?We know also, because we're connected in social networks,that it's easy to create delightin one little place.It's contagious because we're all connected to each other.So if I have a terrific experienceand I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.The opposite, as we know, is also true,often more true.So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A.,doing the things that gourmet food trucks do,and they've gathered quite a following.In general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur,I look at things as platforms.Platforms are invitations.So creating Craigslistor iTunes and the iPhone developer network,there are all these networks -- Facebook as well.These platforms invite all sorts of developersand all sorts of peopleto come with their ideas and their opportunityto create and target an applicationfor a particular audience.And honestly, it's full of surprises.Because I don't think any of us in this roomcould have predicted the sorts of applicationsthat have happened at Facebook, around Facebook,for example, two years ago,when Mark announcedthat they were going to go with a platform.So in this way, I think that cities are platforms,and certainly Detroit is a platform.The invitation of bringingmakers and artists and entrepreneurs --it really helps stimulate this fiery creativityand helps a city to thrive.It's inviting participation,and cities have, historically,invited all sorts of participation.Now we're saying that there's other options as well.So, for example, city departmentscan open up transit data.Google has made available transit data API.And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.that have provided the transit data,and different developers are building applications.So I was having a coffee in Portland,and half-of-a-latte inand the little board in the cafeall of a sudden starts showing methat the next bus is coming in three minutesand the train is coming in 16 minutes.And so it's reliable, real datathat's right in my face, where I am,so I can finish the latte.There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now:about 21 percentof vacant commercial and industrial space.That space is not vital.The areas around it lack vitalityand vibrancy and engagement.There's this thing -- how many people herehave heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?Oh, great. So I'm a big fan of this.And this is a very mesh-y thing.Essentially, there are all sortsof restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.There's a pop-up general store every three weeks,and they do a fantastic jobof making a very social eventhappening for foodies.Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.Subsequent to that,after it's been going for about a year now,they actually started to lease and create and extend.An area that was edgy-artsyis now starting to become much coolerand engage a lot more people.So this is an example.The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts,and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.But these sorts of things are happeningin many different environments.From my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores dois create perishability and urgency.It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson:sold out.And the opportunity to really focus trust and attentionis a wonderful thing.So a lot of what we see in the mesh,and a lot of what we have in the platform that we builtallows us to define, refine and scale.It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur,to go to market,to be in conversation with people,listen, refine something and go back.It's very cost-effective,and it's very mesh-y.The infrastructure enables that.In closing, and as we're moving towards the end,I just also want to encourage --and I'm willing to share my failures as well,though not from the stage.(Laughter)I would just like to say that one of the big things,when we look at wasteand when we look at ways that we can really be generousand contribute to each other,but also move to create a better economic situationand a better environmental situation,is by sharing failures.And one quick exampleis Velib, in 2007,came forward in Pariswith a very bold proposition,a very big bike-sharing service.They made a lot of mistakes.They had some number of big successes.But they were very transparent, or they had to be,in the way that they exposedwhat worked and didn't work.And so B.C. in Barcelonaand B-cycleand Boris Bikes in London --no one has had to repeatthe version 1.0 screw-upsand expensive learning exercisesthat happened in Paris.So the opportunity when we're connectedis also to share failures and successes.We're at the very beginning of somethingthat, what we're seeingand the way that mesh companies are coming forward,is inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early.I have a website -- it's a directory --and it started with about 1,200 companies,and in the last two-and-a-half monthsit's up to about 3,300 companies.And it grows on a very regular daily basis.But it's very much at the beginning.So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride.And thank you very much.(Applause)

Ever since I was a little girlseeing "Star Wars" for the first time,I've been fascinated by this ideaof personal robots.And as a little girl,I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with usmuch more like a helpful, trusted sidekick --something that would delight us, enrich our livesand help us save a galaxy or two.I knew robots like that didn't really exist,but I knew I wanted to build them.So 20 years pass --I am now a graduate student at MITstudying artificial intelligence,the year is 1997,and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars.But robots are still not in our home, ironically.And I remember thinking aboutall the reasons why that was the case.But one really struck me.Robotics had really been about interacting with things,not with people --certainly not in a social way that would be natural for usand would really help people accept robotsinto our daily lives.For me, that was the white space; that's what robots could not do yet.And so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet,the world's first social robot.Three years later --a lot of programming,working with other graduate students in the lab --Kismet was ready to start interacting with people.(Video) Scientist: I want to show you something.Kismet: (Nonsense)Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me.Kismet: (Nonsense)Scientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too.I almost lost it this week.Cynthia Breazeal: So Kismet interacted with peoplelike kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child,which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind.It didn't speak language, but it didn't matter.This little robot was somehow ableto tap into something deeply social within us --and with that, the promise of an entirely new waywe could interact with robots.So over the past several yearsI've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots,now at the media labwith my own team of incredibly talented students.And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo.We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio.And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo.This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo,introducing Leo to a new object.And because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it.But sort of like us, he can actually learn about itfrom watching Matt's reaction.(Video) Matt Berlin: Hello, Leo.Leo, this is Cookie Monster.Can you find Cookie Monster?Leo, Cookie Monster is very bad.He's very bad, Leo.Cookie Monster is very, very bad.He's a scary monster.He wants to get your cookies.(Laughter)CB: All right, so Leo and Cookiemight have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start,but they get along great now.So what I've learnedthrough building these systemsis that robots are actuallya really intriguing social technology,where it's actually their abilityto push our social buttonsand to interact with us like a partnerthat is a core part of their functionality.And with that shift in thinking, we can now start to imaginenew questions, new possibilities for robotsthat we might not have thought about otherwise.But what do I mean when I say "push our social buttons?"Well, one of the things that we've learnedis that, if we design these robots to communicate with ususing the same body language,the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use --like Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here --what we find is that people respond to robotsa lot like they respond to people.People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is,how likable, how engaging,how trustworthy.It turns out it's the same for robots.It's turning out nowthat robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific toolto understand human behavior.To answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter,we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is?Mimicry's believed to play a role, but how?Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters?It turns out it's really hardto learn this or understand this from watching peoplebecause when we interact we do all of these cues automatically.We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us.But with the robot, you can.And so in this video here --this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University.He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with.There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cuesto be able to study this question.And the bottom line is -- the reason why this works isbecause it turns out people just behave like peopleeven when interacting with a robot.So given that key insight,we can now start to imaginenew kinds of applications for robots.For instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues,maybe they would be a cool, new communication technology.So imagine this:What about a robot accessory for your cellphone?You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot,and, bam! You're a MeBot --you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends,you can move around, you can gesture --maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?To explore this question,my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a studywhere we brought human participants, people, into our labto do a collaborative taskwith a remote collaborator.The task involved thingslike looking at a set of objects on the table,discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task --this ended up being a survival task --and then rating them in termsof how valuable and important they thought they were.The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our groupwho used one of three different technologiesto interact with the participants.The first was just the screen.This is just like video conferencing today.The next was to add mobility -- so, have the screen on a mobile base.This is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today --this is mirroring that situation.And then the fully expressive MeBot.So after the interaction,we asked people to rate their quality of interactionwith the technology, with a remote collaboratorthrough this technology, in a number of different ways.We looked at psychological involvement --how much empathy did you feel for the other person?We looked at overall engagement.We looked at their desire to cooperate.And this is what we see when they use just the screen.It turns out, when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table --you get a little more of a boost.And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression.So it seems like this physical, social embodimentactually really makes a difference.Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context.Today we know that families are living further and further apart,and that definitely takes a toll on family relationshipsand family bonds over distance.For me, I have three young boys,and I want them to have a really good relationshipwith their grandparents.But my parents live thousands of miles away,so they just don't get to see each other that often.We try Skype, we try phone calls,but my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk;they want to play.So I love the idea of thinking about robotsas a new kind of distance-play technology.I imagine a time not too far from now --my mom can go to her computer,open up a browser and jack into a little robot.And as grandma-bot,she can now play, really play,with my sons, with her grandsons,in the real world with his real toys.I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-playswith their granddaughters, with their friends,and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house,like sharing a bedtime story.And through this technology,being able to be an active participantin their grandchildren's livesin a way that's not possible today.Let's think about some other domains,like maybe health.So in the United States today,over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese,and now it's a big problem with our children as well.And we know that as you get older in life,if you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseasesthat not only reduce your quality of life,but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system.But if robots can be engaging,if we like to cooperate with robots,if robots are persuasive,maybe a robot can help youmaintain a diet and exercise program,maybe they can help you manage your weight.Sort of like a digital Jiminy --as in the well-known fairy tale --a kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always thereto be able to help you make the right decisionin the right way at the right timeto help you form healthy habits.So we actually explored this idea in our lab.This is a robot, Autom.Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.It could make eye contact with you.It could share information looking down at a screen.You'd use a screen interface to enter information,like how many calories you ate that day,how much exercise you got.And then it could help track that for you.And the robot spoke with a synthetic voiceto engage you in a coaching dialoguemodeled after trainersand patients and so forth.And it would build a working alliance with youthrough that dialogue.It could help you set goals and track your progress,and it would help motivate you.So an interesting question is,does the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot?Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters?To explore that question,we did a study in the Boston areawhere we put one of three interventions in people's homesfor a period of several weeks.One case was the robot you saw there, Autom.Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface,ran exactly the same dialogues.The quality of advice was identical.And the third was just a pen and paper log,because that's the standard intervention you typically getwhen you start a diet-and-exercise program.So one of the things we really wanted to look atwas not how much weight people lost,but really how long they interacted with the robot.Because the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off.And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions,well that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success.So the first thing I want to look at is how long,how long did people interact with these systems.It turns out that people interacted with the robotsignificantly more,even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer.When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance,people rated the robot higherand they trusted the robot more.(Laughter)And when you look at emotional engagement,it was completely different.People would name the robots.They would dress the robots.(Laughter)And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study,they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots.They didn't do this with a computer.The last thing I want to talk about todayis the future of children's media.We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today,whether it's television or computer games or whatnot.My sons, they love the screen. They love the screen.But I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play,like, real-world play.And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you todaycalled Playtime Computingthat's really trying to think about how we can takewhat's so engaging about digital mediaand literally bring it off the screeninto the real world of the child,where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play.So here's the first exploration of this idea,where characters can be physical or virtual,and where the digital contentcan literally come off the screeninto the world and back.I like to think of thisas the Atari Pongof this blended-reality play.But we can push this idea further.What if --(Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay!CB: -- the character itself could come into your world?It turns out that kids love itwhen the character becomes real and enters into their world.And when it's in their world,they can relate to it and play with it in a waythat's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.Another important idea is this notionof persistence of character across realities.So changes that children make in the real worldneed to translate to the virtual world.So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.You can imagine maybe these symbolsgive the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world.So they are now sending the character back into that world.And now it's got number power.And then finally, what I've been trying to do hereis create a really immersive experience for kids,where they really feel like they are part of that story,a part of that experience.And I really want to spark their imaginationsthe way mine was sparked as a little girl watching "Star Wars."But I want to do more than that.I actually want them to create those experiences.I want them to be able to literally build their imaginationinto these experiences and make them their own.So we've been exploring a lot of ideasin telepresence and mixed realityto literally allow kids to project their ideas into this spacewhere other kids can interact with themand build upon them.I really want to come up with new ways of children's mediathat foster creativity and learning and innovation.I think that's very, very important.So this is a new project.We've invited a lot of kids into this space,and they think it's pretty cool.But I can tell you, the thing that they love the mostis the robot.What they care about is the robot.Robots touch something deeply human within us.And so whether they're helping usto become creative and innovative,or whether they're helping usto feel more deeply connected despite distance,or whether they are our trusted sidekickwho's helping us attain our personal goalsin becoming our highest and best selves,for me, robots are all about people.Thank you.(Applause)

What I thought I would dois I would start with a simple request.I'd like all of youto pause for a moment,you wretched weaklings,and take stock of your miserable existence.(Laughter)Now that was the advicethat St. Benedict gave his rather startled followersin the fifth century.It was the advice that I decided to follow myselfwhen I turned 40.Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior --I was eating too much, I was drinking too much,I was working too hardand I was neglecting the family.And I decided that I would tryand turn my life around.In particular, I decidedI would try to address the thorny issueof work-life balance.So I stepped back from the workforce,and I spent a year at homewith my wife and four young children.But all I learned about work-life balancefrom that yearwas that I found it quite easyto balance work and lifewhen I didn't have any work.(Laughter)Not a very useful skill,especially when the money runs out.So I went back to work,and I've spent these seven years sincestruggling with, studyingand writing about work-life balance.And I have four observationsI'd like to share with you today.The first is:if society's to make any progress on this issue,we need an honest debate.But the trouble isso many people talk so much rubbishabout work-life balance.All the discussions about flexi-timeor dress-down Fridaysor paternity leaveonly serve to mask the core issue,which isthat certain job and career choicesare fundamentally incompatiblewith being meaningfully engagedon a day-to-day basiswith a young family.Now the first step in solving any problemis acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.And the reality of the society that we're inis there are thousands and thousandsof people out thereleading lives of quiet, screaming desperation,where they work long, hard hoursat jobs they hateto enable them to buy things they don't needto impress people they don't like.(Laughter)(Applause)It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirtisn't really getting to the nub of the issue.(Laughter)The second observation I'd like to makeis we need to face the truththat governments and corporationsaren't going to solve this issue for us.We should stop looking outside.It's up to us as individualsto take control and responsibilityfor the type of lives that we want to lead.If you don't design your life,someone else will design it for you,and you may just not liketheir idea of balance.It's particularly important --this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired --it's particularly importantthat you never put the quality of your lifein the hands of a commercial corporation.Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies --the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.(Laughter)I'm talking about all companies.Because commercial companiesare inherently designedto get as much out of you [as]they can get away with.It's in their nature; it's in their DNA;it's what they do --even the good, well-intentioned companies.On the one hand,putting childcare facilities in the workplaceis wonderful and enlightened.On the other hand, it's a nightmare --it just means you spend more time at the bloody office.We have to be responsiblefor setting and enforcingthe boundaries that we want in our life.The third observation iswe have to be carefulwith the time frame that we chooseupon which to judge our balance.Before I went back to workafter my year at home,I sat downand I wrote outa detailed, step-by-step descriptionof the ideal balanced daythat I aspired to.And it went like this:wake up well restedafter a good night's sleep.Have sex.Walk the dog.Have breakfast with my wife and children.Have sex again.(Laughter)Drive the kids to school on the way to the office.Do three hours' work.Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.Do another three hours' work.Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.Drive home for dinnerwith my wife and kids.Meditate for half an hour.Have sex.Walk the dog. Have sex again.Go to bed.(Applause)How often do you think I have that day?(Laughter)We need to be realistic.You can't do it all in one day.We need to elongate the time frameupon which we judge the balance in our life,but we need to elongate itwithout falling into the trapof the "I'll have a life when I retire,when my kids have left home,when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing,I've got no mates or interests left."(Laughter)A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.There's got to be a middle way.A fourth observation:We need to approach balancein a balanced way.A friend came to see me last year --and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last yearand said, "Nigel, I've read your book.And I realize that my life is completely out of balance.It's totally dominated by work.I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day.All of my relationships have failed.There's nothing in my lifeapart from my work.So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out.So I joined a gym."(Laughter)Now I don't mean to mock,but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office ratisn't more balanced; it's more fit.(Laughter)Lovely though physical exercise may be,there are other parts to life --there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side;there's the spiritual side.And to be balanced,I believe we have to attendto all of those areas --not just do 50 stomach crunches.Now that can be daunting.Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.You want me to go to church and call my mother."And I understand.I truly understand how that can be daunting.But an incident that happened a couple of years agogave me a new perspective.My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today,called me up at the officeand said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" --Harry -- "up from school."Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.So I left work an hour early that afternoonand picked Harry up at the school gates.We walked down to the local park,messed around on the swings, played some silly games.I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe,and we shared a pizza for two,then walked down the hill to our home,and I gave him his bathand put him in his Batman pajamas.I then read him a chapterof Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach."I then put him to bed, tucked him in,gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate,"and walked out of his bedroom.As I was walking out of his bedroom,he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?"He went, "Dad, this has been the best dayof my life, ever."I hadn't done anything,hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.Now my point isthe small things matter.Being more balanceddoesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.With the smallest investmentin the right places,you can radically transform the quality of your relationshipsand the quality of your life.Moreover, I think,it can transform society.Because if enough people do it,we can change society's definition of successaway from the moronically simplistic notionthat the person with the most money when he dies wins,to a more thoughtful and balanced definitionof what a life well lived looks like.And that, I think,is an idea worth spreading.(Applause)

I'm going to be talking to youabout how we can tapa really underutilized resource in health care,which is the patient,or, as I like to use the scientific term,people.Because we are all patients, we are all people.Even doctors are patients at some point.So I want to talk about thatas an opportunitythat we really have failed to engage with very well in this countryand, in fact, worldwide.If you want to get at the big part --I mean from a public health level, where my training is --you're looking at behavioral issues.You're looking at things where people are actually given information,and they're not following through with it.It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes,obesity, many forms of heart disease,even some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking.Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do.They know what they're supposed to be doing,but they're not doing it.Now behavior change is somethingthat is a long-standing problem in medicine.It goes all the way back to Aristotle.And doctors hate it, right?I mean, they complain about it all the time.We talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance.When people don't take their pills,when people don't follow doctors' orders --these are behavior problems.But for as much as clinical medicineagonizes over behavior change,there's not a lot of work donein terms of trying to fix that problem.So the crux of itcomes down to this notion of decision-making --giving information to people in a formthat doesn't just educate themor inform them,but actually leads them to make better decisions,better choices in their lives.One part of medicine, though,has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well,and that's dentistry.Dentistry might seem -- and I think it is --many dentists would have to acknowledgeit's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine.Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry.But they have really taken this problem of behavior changeand solved it.It's the one great preventive health successwe have in our health care system.People brush and floss their teeth.They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it.So I'm going to talk about one experimentthat a few dentists in Connecticutcooked up about 30 years ago.So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one,because it was very simple,so it's an easy story to tell.So these Connecticut dentists decidedthat they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often,and they were going to use one variable:they wanted to scare them.They wanted to tell them how bad it would beif they didn't brush and floss their teeth.They had a big patient population.They divided them up into two groups.They had a low-fear population,where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation,all based in science,but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth,you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth,but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad.So that was the low-fear group.The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick.They showed bloody gums.They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth.They told them that their teeth were going to fall out.They said that they could have infectionsthat would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies,and ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth.They would get dentures, and if you got dentures,you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob,you weren't going to be able to eat apples,you weren't going to be able to eat steak.You'll eat mush for the rest of your life.So go brush and floss your teeth.That was the message. That was the experiment.Now they measured one other variable.They wanted to capture one other variable,which was the patients' sense of efficacy.This was the notion of whether the patients feltthat they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth.So they asked them at the beginning,"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?"And the people who said, "Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,"they were characterized as high efficacy,and the people who said,"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,"they were characterized as low efficacy.So the upshot was this.The upshot of this experimentwas that fear was not really a primary driverof the behavior at all.The people who brushed and flossed their teethwere not necessarily the peoplewho were really scared about what would happen --it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacityto change their behavior.So fear showed up as not really the driver.It was the sense of efficacy.So I want to isolate this,because it was a great observation --30 years ago, right, 30 years ago --and it's one that's laid fallow in research.It was a notion that really came outof Albert Bandura's work,who studied whetherpeople could get a sense of empowerment.The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- thatif somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior.In health care terms, you could characterize thisas whether or not somebody feelsthat they see a path towards better health,that they can actually see their way towards getting better health,and that's a very important notion.It's an amazing notion.We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well.Except, maybe we do.So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work.And this is a great exampleof how we haven't learned that lesson at all.This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association.This is still the way we're communicating messages about health.I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night,and he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?"And I had to explain, "They're trying to scare people."And I don't know if it works.Now here's what does work:personalized information works.Again, Bandura recognized thisyears ago, decades ago.When you give people specific informationabout their health, where they stand,and where they want to get to, where they might get to,that path, that notion of a path --that tends to work for behavior change.So let me just spool it out a little bit.So you start with personalized data, personalized informationthat comes from an individual,and then you need to connect it to their lives.You need to connect it to their lives,hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand.Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated.And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers --this overload of health informationthat we're inundated with.But it actually hits home.It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts.There's an emotional connection to informationbecause it's from us.That information then needs to be connected to choices,needs to be connected to a range of options,directions that we might go to --trade-offs, benefits.Finally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action.We need to connect the informationalways with the action,and then that action feeds backinto different information,and it creates, of course, a feedback loop.Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notionfor behavior change.But the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there --personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by.It's a difficult and expensive commodity,until now.So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works.So we've all seen these. These are the "your speed limit" signs.You've seen them all around,especially these days as radars are cheaper.And here's how they work in the feedback loop.So you start with the personalized datawhere the speed limit on the road that you are at that pointis 25,and, of course, you're going faster than that.We always are. We're always going above the speed limit.The choice in this case is pretty simple.We either keep going fast, or we slow down.We should probably slow down,and that point of action is probably now.We should take our foot off the pedal right now,and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effectivein terms of getting people to slow down.They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.They last for about five miles,in which case we put our foot back on the pedal.But it works, and it even has some health repercussions.Your blood pressure might drop a little bit.Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits.But by and large, this is a feedback loopthat's so nifty and too rare.Because in health care, most health care,the data is very removed from the action.It's very difficult to line things up so neatly.But we have an opportunity.So I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think abouthow we deliver health information in this country,how we actually get information.This is a pharmaceutical ad.Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad.Nobody's had the brilliant ideaof calling their drug Havidol quite yet.But it looks completely right.So it's exactly the way we gethealth information and pharmaceutical information,and it just sounds perfect.And then we turn the page of the magazine,and we see this --now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companiesto put into their ads, or to follow their ads,Because we know.Who among us would actually say that people read this?And who among us would actually saythat people who do try to read thisactually get anything out of it?This is a bankrupt effortat communicating health information.There is no good faith in this.So this is a different approach.This is an approach that has been developedby a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School,Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin.And they created this thing called the "drug facts box."They took inspiration from, of all things,Cap'n Crunch.They went to the nutritional information boxand saw that what works for cereal, works for our food,actually helps people understand what's in their food.God forbid we should use that same standardthat we make Cap'n Crunch live byand bring it to drug companies.So let me just walk through this quickly.It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for,so you can start to personalize your understandingof whether the information is relevant to youor whether the drug is relevant to you.You can understand exactly what the benefits are.It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what,but you get the statistics for how effective it is.And finally, you understand what those choices are.You can start to unpack the choices involvedbecause of the side effects.Every time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect.So it spells those out in very clean terms,and that works.So I love this. I love that drug facts box.And so I was thinking about,what's an opportunity that I could haveto help people understand information?What's another latent body of information that's out therethat people are really not putting to use?And so I came up with this: lab test results.Blood test results are this great source of information.They're packed with information.They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients.They go right to doctors.And God forbid -- I think many doctors, if you really asked them,they don't really understand all this stuff either.This is the worst presented information.You ask Tufte, and he would say,"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible."What we did at Wiredwas we went, and I got our graphic design departmentto re-imagine these lab reports.So that's what I want to walk you through.So this is the general blood work before,and this is the after, this is what we came up with.The after takes what was four pages --that previous slide was actuallythe first of four pages of datathat's just the general blood work.It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know.This is our one-page summary.We use the notion of color.It's an amazing notion that color could be used.So on the top-level you have your overall results,the things that might jump out at you from the fine print.Then you can drill downand understand how actually we put your level in context,and we use color to illustrateexactly where your value falls.In this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetesbecause of their glucose level.Likewise, you can go over your lipidsand, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level isand then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose.But again, always using colorand personalized proximityto that information.All those other values,all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing,we summarize.We tell you that you're okay, you're normal.But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk.And then we do two other very important thingsthat kind of help fill in this feedback loop:we help people understand in a little more detailwhat these values are and what they might indicate.And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do.We give them some insightinto what choices they can make, what actions they can take.So that's our general blood work test.Then we went to CRP test.In this case, it's a sin of omission.They have this huge amount of space,and they don't use it for anything, so we do.Now the CRP test is often donefollowing a cholesterol test,or in conjunction with a cholesterol test.So we take the bold stepof putting the cholesterol information on the same page,which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it.So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well.It's a protein that shows upwhen your blood vessels might be inflamed,which might be a risk for heart disease.What you're actually measuringis spelled out in clean language.Then we use the informationthat's already in the lab report.We use the person's age and their genderto start to fill in the personalized risks.So we start to use the data we haveto run a very simple calculationthat's on all sorts of online calculatorsto get a sense of what the actual risk is.The last one I'll show you is a PSA test.Here's the before, and here's the after.Now a lot of our effort on this one --as many of you probably know,a PSA test is a very controversial test.It's used to test for prostate cancer,but there are all sorts of reasonswhy your prostate might be enlarged.And so we spent a good deal of our timeindicating that.We again personalized the risks.So this patient is in their 50s,so we can actually give them a very precise estimateof what their risk for prostate cancer is.In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that.And then again, the follow-up actions.So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right.That's what Wired magazine spent on this.Why is Wired magazine doing this?(Laughter)Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp,the two largest lab testing companies --last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollarsand over 500 million dollars respectively.Now this is not a problem of resources;this is a problem of incentives.We need to recognize that the target of this informationshould not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company.It should be the patient.It's the person who actually, in the end,is going to be having to change their livesand then start adopting new behaviors.This is information that is incredibly powerful.It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.But we're not using it. It's just sitting there.It's being lost.So I want to just offer four questionsthat every patient should ask,because I don't actually expect peopleto start developing these lab test reports.But you can create your own feedback loop.Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions:Can I have my results?And the only acceptable answer is --(Audience: Yes.) -- yes.What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is.What are my options? What choices are now on the table?And then, what's next?How do I integrate this informationinto the longer course of my life?So I want to wind up by just showingthat people have the capacity to understand this information.This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people.You do not need to have the education level of people in this room.Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information,if we only go to the effort of presenting it to themin a form that they can engage with.And engagement is essential here,because it's not just giving them information;it's giving them an opportunity to act.That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance.It works totally different from the way we talk about behaviorin medicine today.And this information is out there.I've been talking today about latent information,all this information that exists in the systemthat we're not putting to use.But there are all sorts of other bodies of informationthat are coming online,and we need to recognize the capacity of this informationto engage people, to help peopleand to change the course of their lives.Thank you very much.(Applause)

The world is changingwith really remarkable speed.If you look at the chart at the top here,you'll see that in 2025,these Goldman Sachs projectionssuggest that the Chinese economywill be almost the same size as the American economy.And if you look at the chartfor 2050,it's projected that the Chinese economywill be twice the size of the American economy,and the Indian economy will be almost the same sizeas the American economy.And we should bear in mind herethat these projections were drawn upbefore the Western financial crisis.A couple of weeks ago,I was looking at the latest projectionby BNP Paribasfor when Chinawill have a larger economythan the United States.Goldman Sachs projected 2027.The post-crisis projectionis 2020.That's just a decade away.China is going to change the worldin two fundamental respects.First of all,it's a huge developing countrywith a population of 1.3 billion people,which has been growing for over 30 yearsat around 10 percent a year.And within a decade,it will have the largest economy in the world.Never before in the modern erahas the largest economy in the worldbeen that of a developing country,rather than a developed country.Secondly,for the first time in the modern era,the dominant country in the world --which I think is what China will become --will be not from the Westand from very, very different civilizational roots.Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the Westthat as countries modernize,they also westernize.This is an illusion.It's an assumption that modernityis a product simply of competition, markets and technology.It is not. It is also shaped equallyby history and culture.China is not like the West,and it will not become like the West.It will remain in very fundamental respectsvery different.Now the big question here is obviously,how do we make sense of China?How do we try to understand what China is?And the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large,is that the conventional approachis that we understand it really in Western terms,using Western ideas.We can't.Now I want to offer youthree building blocksfor trying to understand what China is like,just as a beginning.The first is this:that China is not really a nation-state.Okay, it's called itself a nation-statefor the last hundred years,but everyone who knows anything about Chinaknows it's a lot older than this.This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynastyin 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period --the birth of modern China.And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China.Or immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty,still 2,000 years ago.And you can see already it occupiesmost of what we now know as Eastern China,which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived thenand live now.Now what is extraordinary about thisis, what gives China its sense of being China,what gives the Chinesethe sense of what it is to be Chinese,comes not from the last hundred years,not from the nation-state period,which is what happened in the West,but from the period, if you like,of the civilization-state.I'm thinking here, for example,of customs like ancestral worship,of a very distinctive notion of the state,likewise, a very distinctive notion of the family,social relationships like guanxi,Confucian values and so on.These are all things that comefrom the period of the civilization-state.In other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world,is shaped by its sense of civilization,its existence as a civilization-state,rather than as a nation-state.And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this:Of course we know China's big, huge,demographically and geographically,with a population of 1.3 billion people.What we often aren't really aware ofis the factthat China is extremely diverseand very pluralistic,and in many ways very decentralized.You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing,even though we think this to be the case.It's never been the case.So this is China, a civilization-state,rather than a nation-state.And what does it mean?Well, I think it has all sorts of profound implications.I'll give you two quick ones.The first is thatthe most important political value for the Chineseis unity,is the maintenanceof Chinese civilization.You know, 2,000 years ago, Europe:breakdown -- the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire.It divided, and it's remained divided ever since.China, over the same time period,went in exactly the opposite direction,very painfully holding this huge civilization,civilization-state, together.The secondis maybe more prosaic,which is Hong Kong.Do you remember the handover of Hong Kongby Britain to China in 1997?You may rememberwhat the Chinese constitutional proposition was.One country, two systems.And I'll lay a wagerthat barely anyone in the West believed them."Window dressing.When China gets its hands on Hong Kong,that won't be the case."Thirteen years on,the political and legal system in Hong Kongis as different now as it was in 1997.We were wrong. Why were we wrong?We were wrong because we thought, naturally enough,in nation-state ways.Think of German unification, 1990.What happened?Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West.One nation, one system.That is the nation-state mentality.But you can't run a country like China,a civilization-state,on the basis of one civilization, one system.It doesn't work.So actually the response of Chinato the question of Hong Kong --as it will be to the question of Taiwan --was a natural response:one civilization, many systems.Let me offer you another building blockto try and understand China --maybe not sort of a comfortable one.The Chinese have a very, very differentconception of raceto most other countries.Do you know,of the 1.3 billion Chinese,over 90 percent of themthink they belong to the same race,the Han?Now, this is completely differentfrom the world's [other] most populous countries.India, the United States,Indonesia, Brazil --all of them are multiracial.The Chinese don't feel like that.China is only multiracialreally at the margins.So the question is, why?Well the reason, I think, essentiallyis, again, back to the civilization-state.A history of at least 2,000 years,a history of conquest, occupation,absorption, assimilation and so on,led to the process by which,over time, this notion of the Han emerged --of course, nurturedby a growing and very powerful senseof cultural identity.Now the great advantage of this historical experiencehas been that, without the Han,China could never have held together.The Han identity has been the cementwhich has held this country together.The great disadvantage of itis that the Han have a very weak conceptionof cultural difference.They really believein their own superiority,and they are disrespectfulof those who are not.Hence their attitude, for example,to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans.Or let me give you my third building block,the Chinese state.Now the relationshipbetween the state and society in Chinais very different from that in the West.Now we in the Westoverwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least --that the authority and legitimacy of the stateis a function of democracy.The problem with this propositionis that the Chinese stateenjoys more legitimacyand more authorityamongst the Chinesethan is truewith any Western state.And the reason for thisis because --well, there are two reasons, I think.And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy,because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.And the reason for this is,firstly, because the state in Chinais given a very special --it enjoys a very special significanceas the representative,the embodiment and the guardianof Chinese civilization,of the civilization-state.This is as close as China getsto a kind of spiritual role.And the second reason is because,whereas in Europeand North America,the state's power is continuously challenged --I mean in the European tradition,historically against the church,against other sectors of the aristocracy,against merchants and so on --for 1,000 years,the power of the Chinese statehas not been challenged.It's had no serious rivals.So you can seethat the way in which power has been constructed in Chinais very different from our experiencein Western history.The result, by the way,is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder,a stranger,certainly an organwhose powers need to be limitedor defined and constrained,the Chinese don't see the state like that at all.The Chinese view the stateas an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually,as a member of the family --not just in fact as a member of the family,but as the head of the family,the patriarch of the family.This is the Chinese view of the state --very, very different to ours.It's embedded in society in a different kind of wayto what is the casein the West.And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here,in the Chinese context,is a new kind of paradigm,which is different from anythingwe've had to think about in the past.Know that China believes in the market and the state.I mean, Adam Smith,already writing in the late 18th century, said,"The Chinese market is larger and more developedand more sophisticatedthan anything in Europe."And, apart from the Mao period,that has remained more or less the case ever since.But this is combinedwith an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.The state is everywhere in China.I mean, it's leading firms --many of them are still publicly owned.Private firms, however large they are, like Lenovo,depend in many ways on state patronage.Targets for the economy and so onare set by the state.And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas --as we are familiar with --with something like the one-child policy.Moreover, this is a very old state tradition,a very old tradition of statecraft.I mean, if you want an illustration of this,the Great Wall is one.But this is another, this is the Grand Canal,which was constructed in the first instancein the fifth century B.C.and was finally completedin the seventh century A.D.It went for 1,114 miles,linking Beijingwith Hangzhou and Shanghai.So there's a long historyof extraordinary state infrastructural projectsin China,which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today,which is something like the Three Gorges Damand many other expressionsof state competencewithin China.So there we have three building blocksfor trying to understand the difference that is China --the civilization-state,the notion of raceand the nature of the stateand its relationship to society.And yet we still insist, by and large,in thinking that we can understand Chinaby simply drawing on Western experience,looking at it through Western eyes,using Western concepts.If you want to know whywe unerringly seem to get China wrong --our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect --this is the reason.Unfortunately, I think,I have to say that I thinkattitude towards Chinais that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.It's kind of arrogant.It's arrogant in the sensethat we think that we are best,and therefore we have the universal measure.And secondly, it's ignorant.We refuse to really addressthe issue of difference.You know, there's a very interesting passagein a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian.And Paul Cohen arguesthat the West thinks of itselfas probably the most cosmopolitanof all cultures.But it's not.In many ways,it's the most parochial,because for 200 years,the West has been so dominant in the worldthat it's not really neededto understand other cultures,other civilizations.Because, at the end of the day,it could, if necessary by force,get its own way.Whereas those cultures --virtually the rest of the world, in fact,which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West --have been thereby forced to understand the West,because of the West's presence in those societies.And therefore, they are, as a result,more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.I mean, take the question of East Asia.East Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. --a third of the world's population lives there.Now the largest economic region in the world.And I'll tell you now,that East Asianers, people from East Asia,are far more knowledgeableabout the Westthan the West is about East Asia.Now this point is very germane, I'm afraid,to the present.Because what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning,the Goldman Sachs chart.What is happeningis that, very rapidly in historical terms,the world is being drivenand shaped,not by the old developed countries,but by the developing world.We've seen thisin terms of the G20usurping very rapidly the position of the G7,or the G8.And there are two consequences of this.First, the Westis rapidly losingits influence in the world.There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago --Copenhagen, climate change conference.Europe was not at the final negotiating table.When did that last happen?I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago.And that is what is going to happen in the future.And the second implicationis that the world will inevitably, as a consequence,become increasingly unfamiliar to us,because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and historiesthat we are not really familiar with,or conversant with.And at last, I'm afraid -- take Europe;America is slightly different --but Europeans by and large, I have to say,are ignorant,are unawareabout the way the world is changing.Some people -- I've got an English friend in China,and he said, "The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion."Well, maybe that's true,maybe that's an exaggeration.But there's another problem which goes along with this --that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world --and that is a sort ofloss of a sense of the future.I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the futurein its confidence.Take the 19th century, for example.But this, alas, is no longer true.If you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future,try China -- there's old Confucius.This is a railway stationthe likes of which you've never seen before.It doesn't even look like a railway station.This is the new [Wuhan] railway stationfor the high-speed trains.China already has a bigger networkthan any other country in the worldand will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.Or take this: now this is an idea,but it's an idea to be tried out shortlyin a suburb of Beijing.Here you have a megabus,on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.It travels on railsdown a suburban road,and the cars travel underneath it.And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour.Now this is the way things are going to move,because China has a very specific problem,which is different from Europeand different from the United States:China has huge numbers of people and no space.So this is a solution to a situationwhere China's going to havemany, many, many citiesover 20 million people.Okay, so how would I like to finish?Well, what should our attitude betowards this worldthat we seevery rapidly developingbefore us?I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it.But I want to argue, above all,a big-picture positive for this world.For 200 years,the world was essentially governedby a fragment of the human population.That's what Europe and North America represented.The arrival of countrieslike China and India --between them 38 percent of the world's population --and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on,represent the most important single actof democratizationin the last 200 years.Civilizations and cultures,which had been ignored, which had no voice,which were not listened to, which were not known about,will have a different sortof representation in this world.As humanists, we must welcome, surely,this transformation,and we will have to learnabout these civilizations.This big ship herewas the one sailed in by Zheng Hein the early 15th centuryon his great voyagesaround the South China Sea, the East China Seaand across the Indian Ocean to East Africa.The little boat in front of itwas the one in which, 80 years later,Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic.(Laughter)Or, look carefullyat this silk scrollmade by ZhuZhouin 1368.I think they're playing golf.Christ, the Chinese even invented golf.Welcome to the future. Thank you.(Applause)

I am honored to be here,and I'm honored to talk about this topic,which I think is of grave importance.We've been talking a lotbut plastic hurts people, too --especially poor people.And both in the production of plastic,are poor people.People got very upsetwhen the BP oil spill happened,for very good reason.People thought, "Oh, my God.People are going to be hurt.This is a terrible thing,What people don't think about is:but there's a place called "Cancer Alley,"and the reason it's called "Cancer Alley"is because the petrochemical industrytakes that oil and turns it into plasticand in the process, kills people.they're a problem when there's not.And what we don't often appreciateis the price that poor people payfor us to have these disposable products.we have something called choice.and not be poor and brokeSo low-income people often are the onesthat their children are using.of this poisonous plastic in using it.And if that weren't bad enough --in places like Cancer Alley,at the point of disposal,Often, we think we're doing a good thing:You think, "I put mine in the blue bin."And we use that as a moral tickle.We feel so good about ourselves.If we -- well, OK, I'm just ... me.Not you, but I feel this way often.(Laughter)on its journey,that bottle is going to be put on a boat,at some expense,I think in our minds, we imagine(Laughter)"You've served so well."(Laughter)He's given a little bottle massage,a little bottle medal.(Laughter)But that's not actually what happens.You know?That bottle winds up getting burned.which releases incredible toxic chemicalsand, once again, kills people.are having their lives shortened.They're all being harmed -- greatly --It's just awful. Those poor people.But what we don't understand is --here we are in Los Angeles.happening here in Los Angeles.But guess what?that we've achieved here in Californiait's coming across the ocean,We're back where we were in the 1970s.And so we're on one planet,The root of this problem, in my view,is the idea of disposability itself.You see, if you understand the linkand what we're doing to poor people,In order to trash the planet,you have to trash people.you can't trash the planet.So now we are at a momentand ecology as an idea,we finally can now seeWe don't have disposable resources.We don't have disposable species.We don't have a throwaway planet,Biomimicry,which is an emerging science,Democracy, by the way,But if we want to make something hard,and drag stuff out of the groundBut I got this hard thing!"(Laughter)"I'm so clever!"But guess what?A clamshell is hard.There's no poison. There's no pollution.how to create many of the things we needThat's called biomimicry,zero pollution production;that we could actually enjoywithout trashing the planet.Well, that idea of biomimicry,respecting the wisdom of all species,would give us a different society.We would have a different economy.We would have a green societythat Dr. King would be proud of.That should be the goal.that the idea of disposabilitybut it even corrupts our own society.We're so proud to live here in California."Well -- not in our state!"(Laughter)(Laughter)Just so proud.And, yeah, I'm proud, too.But ...we also, unfortunately, lead the worldin some of the gulag stuff.of all the 50 states.but sometimes not as passionatefive percent of the world's population,25 percent of the greenhouse gases,So that is consistent with this ideaAnd yet,that has to grow,How can these people be so passionate?somebody in Watts,"How can these people be so passionateabout making sureor an aluminum can has a second chance,he doesn't get a second chance?"and yet accept throwaway livesWhen we take on topics like this,and to become more inclusive and to grow,Most of you are good, softhearted people."Can't love the whole world --And really, they fundamentally told you,"Are you going to hug a tree?Or are you going to hug a child? Pick.Are you going to hug a tree?Or are you going to hug a child? Pick."you realize the whole thing is connected.we can hug both.Thank you very much.(Applause)

I just did something I've never done before.I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.Now I'm not a scientist,but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific teamfrom the University of South Floridawho have been tracking the travels of BP's oilin the Gulf of Mexico.This is the boat we were on, by the way.The scientists I was withwere not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff --the birds, the turtles,the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.They're looking at the really little stuffthat gets eaten by the slightly less little stuffthat eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.And what they're findingis that even trace amounts of oil and dispersantscan be highly toxic to phytoplankton,which is very bad news,because so much life depends on it.So contrary to what we heard a few months backabout how 75 percent of that oilsort of magically disappearedand we didn't have to worry about it,this disaster is still unfolding.It's still working its way up the food chain.Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.Rachel Carson --the godmother of modern environmentalism --warned us about this very thingback in 1962.She pointed out that the "control men" --as she called them --who carpet-bombed towns and fieldswith toxic insecticides like DDT,were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects,not the birds.But they forgot this:the fact that birds dine on grubs,that robins eat lots of wormsnow saturated with DDT.And so, robin eggs failed to hatch,songbirds died en masse,towns fell silent.Thus the title "Silent Spring."I've been trying to pinpointwhat keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico,because I'm Canadian,and I can draw no ancestral ties.And I think what it isis I don't think we have fully come to termswith the meaning of this disaster,with what it meant to witness a holeripped in our world,with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earthgush forth on live TV,24 hours a day,for months.After telling ourselves for so longthat our tools and technology can control nature,suddenly we were face-to-facewith our weakness,with our lack of control,as the oil burst outof every attempt to contain it --"top hats," "top kills"and, most memorably, the "junk shot" --the bright ideaof firing old tires and golf ballsdown that hole in the world.But even more strikingthan the ferocious power emanating from that wellwas the recklessnesswith which that power was unleashed --the carelessness, the lack of planningthat characterized the operationfrom drilling to clean-up.If there is one thingBP's watery improv act made clear,it is that, as a culture,we have become far too willing to gamblewith things that are preciousand irreplaceable,and to do so without a back-up plan,without an exit strategy.And BP was hardlyour first experience of this in recent years.Our leaders barrel into wars,telling themselves happy storiesabout cakewalks and welcome parades.Then, it is years of deadly damage control,Frankensteins of sieges and surgesand counter-insurgencies,and once again, no exit strategy.Our financial wizards routinely fall victimto similar overconfidence,convincing themselves that the latest bubbleis a new kind of market --the kind that never goes down.And when it inevitably does,the best and the brightestreach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot --in this case, throwing massive amountsof much-needed public moneydown a very different kind of hole.As with BP, the hole does get plugged,at least temporarily,but not beforeexacting a tremendous price.We have to figure outwhy we keep letting this happen,because we are in the midstof what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all --deciding what to do, or not to do,about climate change.Now as you know,a great deal of time is spent,in this country and around the world,inside the climate debate,on the question of, "What if the IPC scientistsare all wrong?"Now a far more relevant question --as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it --is, "What if those scientists are right?"Given the stakes, the climate crisisclearly calls for us to actbased on the precautionary principle --the theory that holdsthat when human health and the environmentare significantly at riskand when the potential damage is irreversible,we cannot afford to waitfor perfect scientific certainty.Better to err on the side of caution.More overt, the burden of provingthat a practice is safeshould not be placed on the public that would be harmed,but rather on the industry that stands to profit.But climate policy in the wealthy world --to the extent that such a thing exists --is not based on precaution,but rather on cost-benefit analysis --finding the course of action that economists believewill have the least impacton our GDP.So rather than asking, as precaution would demand,what can we do as quickly as possibleto avoid potential catastrophe,we ask bizarre questions like this:"What is the latest possible moment we can waitbefore we begin seriously lowering emissions?Can we put this off till 2020,2030, 2050?"Or we ask,"How much hotter can we let the planet getand still survive?Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or --where we're currently going --four degrees Celsius?"And by the way,the assumption that we can safely controlthe Earth's awesomely complex climate systemas if it had a thermostat,making the planet not too hot, not too cold,but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style --this is pure fantasy,and it's not coming from the climate scientists.It's coming from the economistsimposing their mechanistic thinkingon the science.The fact is that we simply don't knowwhen the warming that we createwill be utterly overwhelmedby feedback loops.So once again,why do we take these crazy riskswith the precious?A range of explanationsmay be popping into your mind by now,like "greed."This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,because taking big risks, as we all know,pays a lot of money.Another explanation that you often hear for recklessnessis hubris.And greed and hubrisare intimately intertwinedwhen it comes to recklessness.For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old bankertaking home 100 times morethan a brain surgeon,then you need a narrative,you need a storythat makes that disparity okay.And you actually don't have a lot of options.You're either an incredibly good scammer,and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system --or you're some kind of boy genius,the likes of which the world has never seen.Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer --are going to make you vastly overconfidentand therefore more proneto taking even bigger risks in the future.By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,had a plaque on his deskinscribed with this inspirational slogan:"What would you attempt to doif you knew you could not fail?"Now this is actually a popular plaque,and this is a crowd of overachievers,so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.Don't feel ashamed.Putting fear of failure out of your mindcan be a very good thingif you're training for a triathlonor preparing to give a TEDTalk,but personally, I think people with the powerto detonate our economy and ravage our ecologywould do better havinga picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,because -- maybe not that one in particular --but I want them thinking about the possibility of failureall of the time.So we have greed,we've got overconfidence/hubris,but since we're here at TEDWomen,let's consider one other factorthat could be contributing in some small wayto societal recklessness.Now I'm not going to belabor this point,but studies do show that, as investors,women are much less proneto taking reckless risks than men,precisely because, as we've already heard,women tend not to suffer from overconfidencein the same way that men do.So it turns outthat being paid less and praised lesshas its upsides --for society at least.The flipside of thisis that constantly being toldthat you are gifted, chosenand born to rulehas distinct societal downsides.And this problem -- call it the "perils of privilege" --brings us closer, I think,to the root of our collective recklessness.Because none of us -- at least in the global North --neither men nor women,are fully exempt from this message.Here's what I'm talking about.Whether we actively believe themor consciously reject them,our culture remains in the gripsof certain archetypal storiesabout our supremacyover others and over nature --the narrative of the newly discovered frontierand the conquering pioneer,the narrative of manifest destiny,the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.And just when you think these stories are fading into history,and that we've gotten over them,they pop up in the strangest places.For instance, I stumbled across this advertisementoutside the women's washroomin the Kansas City airport.It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone,and yes, it really does say,"Slap Mother Nature in the face."And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola --that's just a bonus.I'm showing it because --they're not a sponsor, are they? --because, in its own way,this is a crass versionof our founding story.We slapped Mother Nature around and won,and we always win,because dominating nature is our destiny.But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.There's another one, equally important,about how that very same Mother Natureis so nurturing and so resilientthat we can never make a dent in her abundance.Let's hear from Tony Hayward again."The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into itis tiny in relation to the total water volume."In other words, the ocean is big;she can take it.It is this underlying assumption of limitlessnessthat makes it possibleto take the reckless risks that we do.Because this is our real master-narrative:however much we mess up,there will always be more --more water, more land,more untapped resources.A new bubble will replace the old one.A new technology will come alongto fix the messes we made with the last one.In a way, that is the storyof the settling of the Americas,the supposedly inexhaustible frontierto which Europeans escaped.And it's also the story of modern capitalism,because it was the wealth from this landthat gave birth to our economic system,one that cannot survive without perpetual growthand an unending supplyof new frontiers.Now the problem isthat the story was always a lie.The Earth always did have limits.They were just beyond our sights.And now we are hitting those limitson multiple fronts.I believe that we know this,yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.Not only do we continue to tell and retellthe same tired stories,but we are now doing sowith a frenzy and a furythat, frankly, verges on camp.How else to explain the cultural spaceoccupied by Sarah Palin?Now on the one hand,exhorting us to "drill, baby, drill,"because God put those resources into the groundin order for us to exploit them,and on the other, glorying in the wildernessof Alaska's untouched beautyon her hit reality TV show.The twin message is as comforting as it is mad.Ignore those creeping fearsthat we have finally hit the wall.There are still no limits.There will always be another frontier.So stop worrying and keep shopping.Now, would that this were just aboutSarah Palin and her reality TV show.In environmental circles,we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,we are continuing with business as usual.This assessment, unfortunately,is far too optimistic.The truth is that we have already exhaustedso much of the easily accessible fossil fuelsthat we have already entereda far riskier business era,the era of extreme energy.So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,including the icy Arctic seas,where a clean-up may simply be impossible.It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gasand massive strip-mining operations for coal,the likes of which we haven't yet seen.And most controversially, it means the tar sands.I'm always surprised by how littlepeople outside of Canadaknow about the Alberta Tar Sands,which this year are projected to becomethe number one source of imported oilto the United States.It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,because I believe it speaks to recklessnessand the path we're onlike little else.So this is where the tar sands live,under one of the last magnificentBoreal forests.The oil is not liquid.You can't just drill a hole and pump it out.Tar sand's oil is solid,mixed in with the soil.So to get at it,you first have to get rid of the trees.Then, you rip off the topsoiland get at that oily sand.The process requires a huge amount of water,which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.That's very bad news for local indigenous peopleliving downstreamwho are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.Now looking at these images,it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,which can already be seen from spaceand could grow to an area the size of England.I find it helps actuallyto look at the dump trucks that move the earth,the largest ever built.That's a person down there by the wheel.My point is thatthis is not oil drilling.It's not even mining.It is terrestrial skinning.Vast, vivid landscapesare being gutted,left monochromatic gray.Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concernedthis would be an abominationif it emitted not one particle of carbon.But the truth is that, on average,turning that gunk into crude oilproduces about three times more greenhouse gas pollutionthan it does to produce conventional oilin Canada.How else to describe this,but as a form of mass insanity?Just when we know we need to be learningto live on the surface of our planet,off the power of sun, wind and waves,we are frantically diggingto get at the dirtiest,highest-emitting stuff imaginable.This is where our story of endless growthhas taken us,to this black hole at the center of my country --a place of such planetary painthat, like the BP gusher,one can only stand to look at it for so long.As Jared Diamond and others have shown us,this is how civilizations commit suicide,by slamming their foot on the acceleratorat the exact momentwhen they should be putting on the brakes.The problem is that our master-narrativehas an answer for that too.At the very last minute, we are going to get savedjust like in every Hollywood movie,just like in the Rapture.But, of course, our secular religion is technology.Now, you may have noticedmore and more headlines like these.The idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called,is that, as the planet heats up,we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particlesinto the stratosphereto reflect some of the sun's raysback to space,thereby cooling the planet.The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up --would put what is essentially a garden hose18-and-a-half miles high into the sky,suspended by balloons,to spew sulfur dioxide.So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.Think of it as the ultimate junk shot.The serious scientists involved in this researchall stress that these techniquesare entirely untested.They don't know if they'll work,and they have no ideawhat kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineeringis being greeted in some circles,particularly media circles,with a relief tinged with euphoria.An escape hatch has been reached.A new frontier has been found.Most importantly,we don't have to change our lifestyles after all.You see, for some people,their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.We badly need some new stories.We need stories that have different kinds of heroeswilling to take different kinds of risks --risks that confront recklessness head on,that put the precautionary principle into practice,even if that means through direct action --like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested,blocking dirty power plantsor fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.We need storiesthat replace that linear narrative of endless growthwith circular narrativesthat remind usthat what goes around comes around.That this is our only home.There is no escape hatch.Call it karma, call it physics,action and reaction, call it precaution --the principle that reminds usthat life is too precious to be riskedfor any profit.Thank you.(Applause)

There are two groups of womenwhen it comes to screening mammography --women in whom mammography works very welland has saved thousands of livesand women in whom it doesn't work well at all.Do you know which group you're in?If you don't, you're not alone.Because the breast has becomea very political organ.The truth has become lostin all the rhetoriccoming from the press, politicians,radiologistsand medical imaging companies.I will do my best this morningto tell you what I think is the truth.But first, my disclosures.I am not a breast cancer survivor.I'm not a radiologist.I don't have any patents,and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company,and I am not seeking your vote.(Laughter)What I amis a doctor of internal medicinewho became passionately interested in this topicabout 10 years agowhen a patient asked me a question.She came to see meafter discovering a breast lump.Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancerin her 40s.She and I were both very pregnant at that time,and my heart just ached for her,imagining how afraid she must be.Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign.But she asked me a question:how confident was Ithat I would find a tumor early on her mammogramif she developed one?So I studied her mammogram,and I reviewed the radiology literature,and I was shocked to discoverthat, in her case,our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogramwere less than the toss of a coin.You may recall a year agowhen a firestorm eruptedafter the United States Preventive Services Task Forcereviewed the world's mammography screening literatureand issued a guidelinerecommending against screening mammogramsin women in their 40s.Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force,even though most of them weren't in anyway familiarwith the mammography studies.It took the Senate just 17 daysto ban the use of the guidelinesin determining insurance coverage.Radiologists were outragedby the guidelines.The pre-eminent mammographer in the United Statesissued the following quoteto the Washington Post.The radiologists were, in turn, criticizedfor protecting their own financial self-interest.But in my view,the radiologists are heroes.There's a shortage of radiologistsqualified to read mammograms,and that's because mammograms are one of the most complexof all radiology studies to interpret,and because radiologistsare sued more oftenover missed breast cancerthan any other cause.But that very fact is telling.Where there is this much legal smoke,there is likely to be some fire.The factor most responsible for that fireis breast density.Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat --pictured here in yellow --versus connective and epithelial tissues --pictured in pink.And that proportionis primarily genetically determined.Two-thirds of women in their 40shave dense breast tissue,which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.And although breast density generally declines with age,up to a third of womenretain dense breast tissuefor years after menopause.So how do you know if your breasts are dense?Well, you need to read the detailsof your mammography report.Radiologists classify breast densityinto four categoriesbased on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.If the breast is less than 25 percent dense,that's called fatty-replaced.The next categoryis scattered fibroglandular densities,followed by heterogeneously denseand extremely dense.And breasts that fall into these two categoriesare considered dense.The problem with breast densityis that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.Both tumors and dense breast tissueappear white on a mammogram,and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.So it's easy to see this tumorin the upper part of this fatty breast.But imagine how difficult it would beto find that tumor in this dense breast.That's why mammograms findover 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts,but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.Now it's bad enough that breast densitymakes it hard to find a cancer,but it turns outthat it's also a powerful predictorof your risk for breast cancer.It's a stronger risk factorthan having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.At the time my patient posed this question to me,breast density was an obscure topicin the radiology literature,and very few women having mammograms,or the physicians ordering them,knew about this.But what else could I offer her?Mammograms have been around since the 1960's,and it's changed very little.There have been surprisingly few innovations,until digital mammography was approvedin 2000.Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,but the imagescan be stored and manipulated digitally,just like we can with a digital camera.The U.S. has investedfour billion dollarsconverting to digital mammography equipment,and what have we gained from that investment?In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,digital mammography was foundto be no better over allthan traditional mammography,and in fact, it was worse in older women.But it was better in one group,and that was women under 50who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,and in those women,digital mammography found twice as many cancers,but it still only found 60 percent.So digital mammographyhas been a giant leap forwardfor manufacturersof digital mammography equipment,but it's been a very small step forward forwomankind.What about ultrasound?Ultrasound generates more biopsiesthat are unnecessary relative to other technologies,so it's not widely used.And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,but it's also very expensive.If we think about disruptive technology,we see an almost ubiquitous patternof the technology getting smaller and less expensive.Think about iPods compared to stereos.But it's the exact opposite in health care.The machines get ever biggerand ever more expensive.Screening the average young woman with an MRIis kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.It's just way too much equipment.One MRI scancosts 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the factthat health care innovationcan't always come at a much higher price.Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorkeron innovation,and he made the case that scientific discoveriesare rarely the product of one individual's genius.Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated,if you can simply gatherpeople with different perspectives in a roomand get them to talk about thingsthat they don't ordinarily talk about.It's like the essence of TED.He quotes one innovator who says,"The only time a physician and a physicist get togetheris when the physicist gets sick."(Laughter)This makes no sense,because physicians have all kinds of problemsthat they don't realize have solutions.And physicists have all kinds of solutions for thingsthat they don't realize are problems.Now, take a look at this cartoonthat accompanied Gladwell's article,and tell me if you see something disturbingabout this depiction of innovative thinkers.(Laughter)So if you will allow me a little creative license,I will tell you the storyof the serendipitous collisionof my patient's problemwith a physicist's solution.Shortly after her visit,I was introduced to a nuclear physicistat Mayonamed Michael O'Conner,who was a specialist in cardiac imaging,something I had nothing to do with.And he happened to tell meabout a conference he'd just returned from in Israel,where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.Now gamma imaging has been around for a long timeto image the heart,and it had even been tried to image the breast.But the problem wasthat the gamma detectorswere these huge, bulky tubes,and they were filled with these scintillating crystals,and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breastto find small tumors.But the potential advantage wasthat gamma rays, unlike X-rays,are not influenced by breast density.But this technologycould not find tumors when they're small,and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.If you can find a tumorwhen it's less than a centimeter,survival exceeds 90 percent,but drops off rapidlyas tumor size increases.But Michael told me abouta new type of gamma detector that he'd seen,and this is it.It's madenot of a bulky tube,but of a thin layer of a semiconductor materialthat serves as the gamma detector.And I started talking to himabout this problem with breast density,and we realized that we might be able to get this detectorclose enough around the breastto actually find small tumors.So after putting togethera grid of these cubes with tape --(Laughter)-- Michael hacked off the X-ray plateof a mammography machinethat was about to be thrown out,and we attached the new detector,and we decided to call this machineMolecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.This is an image from our first patient.And you can see, using the old gamma technology,that it just looked like noise.But using our new detector,we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.So here we were, a nuclear physicist,an internist,soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,and two radiologists,and we were trying to take onthe entrenched world of mammographywith a machine that was held together by duct tape.To say that we facedhigh doses of skepticismin those early yearsis just a huge understatement,but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this workthat we chipped away with incremental modificationsto this system.This is our current detector.And you can see that it looks a lot different.The duct tape is gone,and we added a second detector on top of the breast,which has further improved our tumor detection.So how does this work?The patient receives an injection of a radio tracerthat's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,but not by normal cells,and this is the key difference from mammography.Mammography relies on differencesin the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,and we've seen that those differencescan be obscured in a dense breast.But MBI exploitsthe different molecular behavior of tumors,and therefore, it's impervious to breast density.After the injection,the patient's breast is placed between the detectors.And if you've ever had a mammogram --if you're old enough to have had a mammogram --you know what comes next:pain.You may be surprised to knowthat mammography is the only radiologic studythat's regulated by federal law,and the law requiresthat the equivalent of a 40-pound car batterycome down on your breast during this study.But with MBI,we use just light, pain-free compression.(Applause)And the detectorthen transmits the image to the computer.So here's an example.You can see, on the right, a mammogramshowing a faint tumor,the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,as well as a second tumor,which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors --one is small as three millimeters.Our big break came in 2004.After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,we used these imagesto submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.And we were elated when they took a chanceon a team of completely unknown investigatorsand funded us to study1,000 women with dense breasts,comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.Of the tumors that we found,mammography foundonly 25 percent of those tumors.MBI found 83 percent.Here's an example from that screening study.The digital mammogram was read as normaland shows lots of dense tissue,but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.And in this case,a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,wanted to enroll in our study.And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,but her MBI showed an areaof worrisome uptake,which we can also see on a color image.And this correspondedto a tumor the size of a golf ball.But fortunately it was removedbefore it had spread to her lymph nodes.So now that we knew that this technologycould find three times more tumors in a dense breast,we had to solve one very important problem.We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,and we have spent the last three yearsmaking modifications to every aspect of the imaging systemto allow this.And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiationthat is equivalent to the effective dosefrom one digital mammogram.And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study,and this image from three weeks agoin a 67-year-old womanshows a normal digital mammogram,but an MBI imageshowing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.So this is not just young women that it's benefiting.It's also older women with dense tissue.And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dosethat's used in any other type of gamma technology.MBI generates four images per breast.MRI generates over a thousand.It takes a radiologistyears of specialty trainingto become expert in differentiatingthe normal anatomic detailfrom the worrisome finding.But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the roomcan find the tumor on the MBI image.But this is why MBIis so potentially disruptive --it's as accurate as MRI,it's far less complex to interpret,and it's a fraction of the cost.But you can understand why there may beforces in the breast-imaging worldwho prefer the status quo.After achieving what we felt were remarkable results,our manuscript was rejectedby four journals.After the fourth rejection,we requested reconsideration of the manuscript,because we strongly suspectedthat one of the reviewers who had rejected ithad a financial conflict of interestin a competing technology.Our manuscript was then acceptedand will be published later this monthin the journal Radiology.(Applause)We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,and then our findings will need to be replicatedat other institutions,and this could take five or more years.If this technology is widely adopted,I will not benefit financially in any way,and that is very important to me,because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.But I recognize --(Applause)I recognize that the adoption of this technologywill depend as much on economicand political forcesas it will on the soundness of the science.The MBI unit has now been FDA approved,but it's not yet widely available.So until something is availablefor women with dense breasts,there are things that you should knowto protect yourself.First, know your density.Ninety percent of women don't,and 95 percent of women don't knowthat it increases your breast cancer risk.The State of Connecticut became the first and only stateto mandate that women receive notificationof their breast densityafter a mammogram.I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaginglast week in Chicago,and I was stunned that there was a heated debateas to whether we should be telling womenwhat their breast density is.Of course we should.And if you don't know, please ask your doctoror read the details of your mammography report.Second, if you're pre-menopausal,try to schedule your mammogramin the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,when breast density is relatively lower.Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,insist on additional imaging.And fourth and most important,the mammography debate will rage on,but I do believe that all women 40 and oldershould have an annual mammogram.Mammography isn't perfect,but it's the only test that's been provento reduce mortality from breast cancer.But this mortality banneris the very swordwhich mammography's most ardent advocates useto deter innovation.Some women who develop breast cancerdie from it many years later,and most women, thankfully, survive.So it takes 10 or more yearsfor any screening methodto demonstrate a reductionin mortality from breast cancer.Mammography's the only one that's been around long enoughto have a chance of making that claim.It is time for us to acceptboth the extraordinary successes of mammographyand the limitations.We need to individualize screeningbased on density.For women without dense breasts,mammography is the best choice.But for women with dense breasts;we shouldn't abandon screening altogether,we need to offer them something better.The babies that we were carryingwhen my patient first asked me this questionare now both in middle school,and the answer has been so slow to come.She's given me her blessingto share this story with you.After undergoing biopsiesthat further increased her risk for cancerand losing her sister to cancer,she made the difficult decisionto have a prophylactic mastectomy.We can and must do better,not just in time for her granddaughtersand my daughters,but in time for you.Thank you.(Applause)

My big ideais a very, very small ideathat can unlockbillions of big ideasthat are at the moment dormant inside us.And my little idea that will do thatis sleep.(Laughter)(Applause)This is a room of type-A women.This is a roomof sleep-deprived women.And I learned the hard way,the value of sleep.Two-and-a-half years ago,I fainted from exhaustion.I hit my head on my desk. I broke my cheekbone,I got five stitches on my right eye.And I began the journeyof rediscovering the value of sleep.And in the course of that,I studied,I met with medical doctors, scientists,and I'm here to tell youthat the way to a more productive,more inspired, more joyful lifeis getting enough sleep.(Applause)And we women are going to lead the wayin this new revolution, this new feminist issue.We are literally going to sleep our way to the top, literally.(Laughter)(Applause)Because unfortunatelyfor men,sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol.I was recently having dinner with a guywho bragged that he had only gottenfour hours sleep the night before.And I felt like saying to him -- but I didn't say it --I felt like saying, "You know what?If you had gotten five,this dinner would have been a lot more interesting."(Laughter)There is now a kind of sleep deprivationone-upmanship.Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date,and you say, "How about eight o'clock?"they're likely to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me,but that's okay, I can get a game of tennis inand do a few conference calls and meet you at eight."And they think that meansthat they are so incredibly busy and productive,but the truth is they're not,because we, at the moment,have had brilliant leadersin business, in finance, in politics,making terrible decisions.So a high I.Q.does not mean that you're a good leader,because the essence of leadershipis being able to see the icebergbefore it hits the Titanic.And we've had far too many icebergshitting our Titanics.In fact, I have a feelingthat if Lehman Brotherswas Lehman Brothers and Sisters,they might still be around.(Applause)While all the brothers were busyjust being hyper-connected 24/7,maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg,because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleepand have been able to seethe big picture.So as we are facingall the multiple crisesin our world at the moment,what is good for us on a personal level,what's going to bring more joy, gratitude,effectiveness in our livesand be the best for our own careersis also what is best for the world.So I urge youto shut your eyesand discover the great ideasthat lie inside us,to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.Thank you.(Applause)

So today, I'm going to tell you about some peoplewho didn't move out of their neighborhoods.The first one is happening right here in Chicago.Brenda Palms-Farber was hiredto help ex-convicts reenter societyand keep them from going back into prison.Currently, taxpayers spendabout 60,000 dollars per yearsending a person to jail.We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.I find it interesting that, for every one dollarwe spend, however, on early childhood education,like Head Start,we save 17 dollarson stuff like incarceration in the future.Or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollarsis more than what it coststo send one person to Harvard as well.But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that,took a look at her challengeand came upwith a not-so-obvious solution:create a businessthat produces skin care products from honey.Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.It's the basis of growing a form of social innovationthat has real potential.She hired seemingly unemployable men and womento care for the bees, harvest the honeyand make value-added productsthat they marketed themselves,and that were later sold at Whole Foods.She combined employment experience and trainingwith life skills they needed,like anger-management and teamwork,and also how to talk to future employersabout how their experiencesactually demonstrated the lessons that they had learnedand their eagerness to learn more.Less than four percentof the folks that went through her programactually go back to jail.So these young men and women learned job-readinessand life skills through bee keepingand became productive citizens in the process.Talk about a sweet beginning.Now, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles,and lots of people knowthat L.A. has its issues.But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.They have not enough water on most daysand too much to handle when it rains.Currently, 20 percentof California's energy consumptionis used to pump waterinto mostly Southern California.Their spending loads, loads,to channel that rainwater out into the oceanwhen it rains and floods as well.Now Andy Lipkis is working to helpL.A. cut infrastructure costsassociated with water management and urban heat island --linking trees, people and technologyto create a more livable city.All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,also helps cool our cities.Because, come to think about it,do you really want air-conditioning,or is it a cooler room that you want?How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.So a few years ago,L.A. Countydecided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollarsto repair the city schools.And Andy and his team discoveredthat they were going to spend 200 million of those dollarson asphalt to surround the schools themselves.And by presenting a really strong economic case,they convinced the L.A. governmentthat replacing that asphaltwith trees and other greenery,that the schools themselves would save the system more on energythan they spend on horticultural infrastructure.So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphaltwas replaced or avoided,and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,while employmentfor people to maintain those grounds went up,resulting in a net-savings to the system,but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.Now Judy Bondsis a coal miner's daughter.Her family has eight generationsin a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.And if anyone should be clingingto the former glory of the coal mining history,and of the town,it should be Judy.But the way coal is mined right now is differentfrom the deep mines that her fatherand her father's father would go down intoand that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.Now, two dozen mencan tear down a mountain in several months,and only for about a few years' worth of coal.That kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal."It can make a mountain go from this to thisin a few short months.Just imagine that the air surrounding these places --it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.When we visited, it gave some of the people we were withthis strange little coughafter being only there for just a few hours or so --not just miners, but everybody.And Judy saw her landscape being destroyedand her water poisoned.And the coal companies just move onafter the mountain was emptied,leaving even more unemployment in their wake.But she also saw the difference in potential wind energyon an intact mountain,and one that was reduced in elevationby over 2,000 feet.Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs,or centuries of clean energywith the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiencybased on technical skills,and developing local knowledgeabout how to get the most out of that region's wind.She calculated the up-front costand the payback over time,and it's a net-plus on so many levelsfor the local, national and global economy.It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal,but the wind energy actually pays back forever.Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals,and it gives them a lot of misery.The water is turned into goo.Most people are still unemployed,leading to most of the same kinds of social problemsthat unemployed people in inner cities also experience --drug and alcohol abuse,domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.Now Judy and I -- I have to say --totally related to each other.Not quite an obvious alliance.I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.I mean, they are not --they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop titleor anything like that.But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,says, "Save the endangered hillbillies."So homegirls and hillbillies we got it togetherand totally understand that this is what it's all about.But just a few months ago,Judy was diagnosedwith stage-three lung cancer.Yeah.And it has since moved to her bones and her brain.And I just find it so bizarrethat she's suffering from the same thingthat she tried so hard to protect people from.But her dreamof Coal River Mountain Windis her legacy.And she might notget to see that mountaintop.But rather than writingyet some kind of manifesto or something,she's leaving behinda business plan to make it happen.That's what my homegirl is doing.So I'm so proud of that.(Applause)But these three peopledon't know each other,but they do have an awful lot in common.They're all problem solvers,and they're just some of the many examplesthat I really am privileged to see, meet and learn fromin the examples of the work that I do now.I was really lucky to have them all featuredon my Corporation for Public Radio radio showcalled ThePromisedLand.org.Now they're all very practical visionaries.They take a look at the demands that are out there --beauty products, healthy schools, electricity --and how the money's flowing to meet those demands.And when the cheapest solutionsinvolve reducing the number of jobs,you're left with unemployed people,and those people aren't cheap.In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,and they include generationally impoverished,traumatized vets returning from the Middle East,people coming out of jail.And for the veterans in particular,the V.A. said there's a six-fold increasein mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.I think that number's probably going to go up.They're not the largest number of people,but they are some of the most expensive --and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,poor performance by their kids in schoolsand also poor health as a result of stress.So these three guys all understandhow to productively channel dollarsthrough our local economiesto meet existing market demands,reduce the social problems that we have nowand prevent new problems in the future.And there are plenty of other examples like that.One problem: waste handling and unemployment.Even when we think or talk about recycling,lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfillsand leaving many municipalities, diversion rates --they leave much to be recycled.And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models --there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park,where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another,or you use recycled materialsto make goods that you can actually use and sell.We can create these local markets and incentivesfor recycled materialsto be used as raw materials for manufacturing.And in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx,but our mayor decided what he wanted to seewas a jail on that same spot.Fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs --but after many years,the city wanted to build a jail.They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.Working-class and poor urban Americansare not benefiting economicallyfrom our current food system.It relies too much on transportation,chemical fertilization, big use of waterand also refrigeration.Mega agricultural operationsoften are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,and it produces this incredibly unhealthy productthat costs us billions in healthcareand lost productivity.And so we know "urban ag"is a big buzz topic this time of the year,but it's mostly gardening,which has some value in community building -- lots of it --but it's not in terms of creating jobsor for food production.The numbers just aren't there.Part of my work now is really laying the groundworkto integrate urban ag and rural food systemsto hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile saladby creating a national brand of urban-grown producein every city,that uses regional growing powerand augments it with indoor growing facilities,owned and operated by small growers,where now there are only consumers.This can support seasonal farmers around metro areaswho are losing out because they really can't meetthe year-round demand for produce.It's not a competition with rural farm;it's actually reinforcements.It allies in a really positiveand economically viable food system.The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demandsfor hospitals,senior centers, schools, daycare centers,and produce a network of regional jobs, as well.This is smart infrastructure.And how we manage our built environmentaffects the health and well-being of people every single day.Our municipalities, rural and urban,play the operational course of infrastructure --things like waste disposal, energy demand,as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration ratesand the impacts of various public health costs.Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving waysfor municipalities to handleboth infrastructure and social needs.And we want to shift the systemsthat open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdensto become part of the tax base.And imagine a national business modelthat creates local jobs and smart infrastructureto improve local economic stability.So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.These examples indicate a trend.I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country,and the good news is that it's growing.And we all need to be invested in it.It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.And I call it "hometown security."The recession has us reeling and fearful,and there's something in the air these daysthat is also very empowering.It's a realizationthat we are the keyto our own recovery.Now is the time for us to act in our own communitieswhere we think local and we act local.And when we do that, our neighbors --be they next-door, or in the next state,or in the next country --will be just fine.The sum of the local is the global.Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses,putting people to work,restoring our natural systems.Hometown security means creating wealth here at home,instead of destroying it overseas.Tackling social and environmental problemsat the same time with the same solutionyields great cost savings,wealth generation and national security.Many great and inspiring solutionshave been generated across America.The challenge for us nowis to identify and support countless more.Now, hometown security is about taking care of your own,but it's not like the old saying,"charity begins at home."I recently read a book called "Love Leadership" by John Hope Bryant.And it's about leading in a worldthat really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.And reading that book made me reexamine that theorybecause I need to explain what I mean by that.See, my dadwas a great, great man in many ways.He grew up in the segregated South,escaped lynching and all thatduring some really hard times,and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblingsand a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.But, like all of us, he had some problems.(Laughter)And his was gambling,compulsively.To him that phrase, "Charity begins at home,"meant that my payday -- or someone else's --would just happen to coincide with his lucky day.So you need to help him out.And sometimes I would loan him moneyfrom my after-school or summer jobs,and he always had the great intentionof paying me back with interest,of course, after he hit it big.And he did sometimes, believe it or not,at a racetrack in Los Angeles --one reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s.He made 15,000 dollars cashand bought the house that I grew up in.So I'm not that unhappy about that.But listen, I did feel obligated to him,and I grew up -- then I grew up.And I'm a grown woman now,and I have learned a few things along the way.To me, charityoften is just about giving,because you're supposed to,or because it's what you've always done,or it's about giving until it hurts.I'm about providing the meansto build something that will growand intensify its original investmentand not just require greater giving next year --I'm not trying to feed the habit.I spent some yearswatching how good intentions for community empowerment,that were supposed to be thereto support the community and empower it,actually left peoplein the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.And over the past 20 years,we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollarson social problems,yet educational outcomes,malnutrition, incarceration,obesity, diabetes, income disparity,they've all gone up with some exceptions --in particular, infant mortalityamong people in poverty --but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.And I know a little bit about these issues,because, for many years, I spent a long timein the non-profit industrial complex,and I'm a recovering executive director,two years clean.(Laughter)But during that time, I realized that it was about projectsand developing them on the local levelthat really was going to do the right thing for our communities.But I really did struggle for financial support.The greater our success,the less money came in from foundations.And I tell you, being on the TED stageand winning a MacArthur in the same exact yeargave everyone the impression that I had arrived.And by the time I'd moved on,I was actually covering a thirdof my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.And I think because early on, frankly,my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.But since then,the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talkbecame this little thing.But I did in fact get married in it.Over here.There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.The South Bronx Greenwaywas also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.Since then, we gotabout 50 million dollars in stimulus package moneyto come and get here.And we love this, because I love construction now,because we're watching these things actually happen.So I want everyone to understandthe critical importanceof shifting charity into enterprise.I started my firm to help communities across the countryrealize their own potentialto improve everything about the quality of life for their people.Hometown securityis next on my to-do list.What we need are people who see the valuein investing in these types of local enterprises,who will partner with folks like meto identify the growth trends and climate adaptationas well as understand the growing social costsof business as usual.We need to work togetherto embrace and repair our land,repair our power systemsand repair ourselves.It's time to stop buildingthe shopping malls, the prisons,the stadiumsand other tributes to all of our collective failures.It is time that we start buildingliving monuments to hope and possibility.Thank you very much.(Applause)

rachel_botsman_the_case_for_collaborative_consumption
1071675

So today I'm going to talk to youabout the rise of collaborative consumption.I'm going to explain what it isand try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes --that this isn't a flimsy idea,or a short-term trend,but a powerful cultural and economic forcereinventing not just what we consume,but how we consume.Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example.Hands up -- how many of youhave books, CDs, DVDs, or videoslying around your housethat you probably won't use again,but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away?Can't see all the hands,but it looks like all of you, right?On our shelves at home,we have a box set of the DVD series "24,"season six to be precise.I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.Now my husband, Chris, and Ilove this show.But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice,you don't really want to watch it again,because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.So there it sits on our shelvesobsolete to us,but with immediate latent value to someone else.Now before we go on, I have a confession to make.I lived in New York for 10 years,and I am a big fan of "Sex and the City."Now I'd love to watch the first movie againas sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week.So how easily could I swapour unwanted copy of "24"for a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?"Now you may have noticedthere's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.Now the easiest analogy for swap-tradingis like an online dating servicefor all your unwanted media.What it does is use the Internetto create an infinite marketplaceto match person A's "haves"with person C's "wants,"whatever they may be.The other week, I went on one of these sites,appropriately called Swaptree,and there were over 59,300 itemsthat I could instantly swapfor my copy of "24."Lo and behold,there in Reseda, CA was Rondoronwho wanted swap his or her"like new" copy of "Sex and the City"for my copy of "24."So in other words, what's happening hereis that Swaptreesolves my carrying company's sugar rush problem,a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants,"in approximately 60 seconds.What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,because it knows the way of the item.Now there are layers of technical wonderbehind sites such as Swaptree,but that's not my interest,and nor is swap trading, per se.My passion, and what I've spent the last few yearsdedicated to researching,is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanicsinherent in these systems.When you think about it,it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,that I would swap my stuff with a total strangerwhose real name I didn't knowand without any money changing hands.Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptreehappen successfully,and the one percent that receive a negative rating,it's for relatively minor reasons,like the item didn't arrive on time.So what's happening here?An extremely powerful dynamicthat has huge commercial and cultural implicationsis at play.Namely, that technologyis enablingtrust between strangers.We now live in a global villagewhere we can mimic the tiesthat used to happen face to face,but on a scale and in waysthat have never been possible before.So what's actually happeningis that social networks and real-time technologiesare taking us back.We're bartering, trading,swapping, sharing,but they're being reinventedinto dynamic and appealing forms.What I find fascinatingis that we've actually wired our world to share,whether that's our neighborhood, our school,our office, or our Facebook network,and that's creating an economyof "what's mine is yours."From the mighty eBay,the grandfather of exchange marketplaces,to car-sharing companies such as GoGet,where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,to social lending platforms such as Zopa,that will take anyone in this audiencewith 100 dollars to lend,and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,we're sharing and collaborating againin ways that I believeare more hip than hippie.I call this "groundswell collaborative consumption."Now before I dig into the different systemsof collaborative consumption,I'd like to try and answer the questionthat every author rightfully gets asked,which is, where did this idea come from?Now I'd like to say I woke up one morningand said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,"but actually it was a complicated webof seemingly disconnected ideas.Over the next minute,you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks displayof all the dots that went on in my head.The first thing I began to notice:how many big concepts were emerging --from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs --around how ridiculously easy it isto form groups for a purpose.And linked to this crowd maniawere examples all around the world --from the election of a presidentto the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between --on what the power of numbers could achieve.Now, you know when you learn a new word,and then you start to see that word everywhere?That's what happened to mewhen I noticed that we are movingfrom passive consumersto creators,to highly enabled collaborators.What's happeningis the Internet is removing the middleman,so that anyone from a T-shirt designerto a knittercan make a living selling peer-to-peer.And the ubiquitous forceof this peer-to-peer revolutionmeans that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.I mean, it's amazing to thinkthat, in every single minute of this speech,25 hoursof YouTube video will be loaded.Now what I find fascinating about these examplesis how they're actually tapping intoour primate instincts.I mean, we're monkeys,and we're born and bred to share and cooperate.And we were doing so for thousands of years,whether it's when we hunted in packs,or farmed in cooperatives,before this big system called hyper-consumption came alongand we built these fencesand created out own little fiefdoms.But things are changing,and one of the reasons whyis the digital natives, or Gen-Y.They're growing up sharing --files, video games, knowledge.It's second nature to them.So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial --are like foot soldiers,moving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we."The reason why it's happening so fastis because of mobile collaboration.We now live in a connected agewhere we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time,from a small device in our hands.All of this was going through my headtowards the end of 2008,when, of course, the great financial crash happened.Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists,and he poignantly commentedthat 2008 is when we hit a wall,when Mother Nature and the marketboth said, "No more."Now we rationally knowthat an economy built on hyper-consumptionis a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.So all of this is a lot of twittering, right?Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head,until actually I realized it was happeningbecause of four key drivers.One, a renewed belief in the importance of community,and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.A torrent of peer-to-peer social networksand real-time technologies,fundamentally changing the way we behave.Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.And four, a global recessionthat has fundamentally shockedconsumer behaviors.These four driversare fusing togetherand creating the big shift --away from the 20th century,defined by hyper-consumption,towards the 21st century,defined by collaborative consumption.I generally believe we're at an inflection pointwhere the sharing behaviors --through sites such as Flickr and Twitterthat are becoming second nature online --are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.From morning commutes to the way fashion is designedto the way we grow food,we are consuming and collaborating once again.So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and Ihave actually gathered thousands of examplesfrom all around the world of collaborative consumption.And although they vary enormouslyin scale, maturity and purpose,when we dived into them,we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.The first is redistribution markets.Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree,are when you take a used, or pre-owned, itemand move it from where it's not neededto somewhere, or someone, where it is.They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' --reduce, reuse, recycle, repairand redistribute --because they stretch the life cycle of a productand thereby reduce waste.The second is collaborative lifestyles.This is the sharing of resourcesof things like money, skills and time.I bet, in a couple of years,that phrases like "coworking"and "couchsurfing" and "time banks"are going to become a part of everyday vernacular.One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestylesis called Landshare.It's a scheme in the U.K.that matches Mr. Jones,with some spare space in his back garden,with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.Together they grow their own food.It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,you wonder why it's never been done before.Now, the third systemis product-service systems.This is where you pay for the benefit of the product --what it does for you --without needing to own the product outright.This idea is particularly powerfulfor things that havehigh-idling capacity.And that can be anything from baby goodsto fashions to --how many of you have a power drill,own a power drill? Right.That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutesin its entire lifetime.(Laughter)It's kind of ridiculous, right?Because what you need is the hole, not the drill.(Laughter)(Applause)So why don't you rent the drill,or, even better, rent out your own drill to other peopleand make some money from it?These three systems are coming together,allowing people to share resourceswithout sacrificing their lifestyles,or their cherished personal freedoms.I'm not asking peopleto share nicely in the sandpit.So I want to just give you an exampleof how powerful collaborative consumption can beto change behaviors.The average carcosts 8,000 dollars a year to run.Yet, that car sits idlefor 23 hours a day.So when you consider these two facts,it starts to make a little less sensethat we have to own one outright.So this is where car-sharing companiessuch as Zipcar and GoGet come in.In 2009,Zipcar took 250 participantsfrom across 13 cities --and they're all self-confessed car addictsand car-sharing rookies --and got them to surrender their keys for a month.Instead, these people had to walk,bike, take the train,or other forms of public transport.They could only use their Zipcar membershipwhen absolutely necessary.The results of this challenge after just one monthwas staggering.It's amazing that 413 lbs were lostjust from the extra exercise.But my favorite statisticis that 100out of the 250 participantsdid not want their keys back.In other words, the car addictshad lost their urge to own.Now products-service systems have been around for years.Just think of libraries and laundrettes.But I think they're entering a new age,because technology makes sharingfrictionless and fun.There's a great quote that was written in the New York Timesthat said, "Sharing is to ownershipwhat the iPod is to the 8-track,what solar power is to the coal mine."I believe also, our generation,our relationship to satisfying what we wantis far less tangiblethan any other previous generation.I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.I don't want a clunky answering machine;I want the message it saves.I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.In other words, I don't want stuff;I want the needs or experiences it fulfills.This is fueling a massive shiftfrom where usage trumps possessions --or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,"where access is better than ownership."Now as our possessionsdematerialize into the cloud,a blurry line is appearingbetween what's mine, what's yours,and what's ours.I want to give you one examplethat shows how fast this evolution is happening.This represents an eight-year time span.We've gone from traditional car-ownershipto car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,to ride-sharing platforms that match ridesto the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,where you can actually make moneyout of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a dayto your neighbor.Now all of these systemsrequire a degree of trust,and the cornerstone to this workingis reputation.Now in the old consumer system,our reputation didn't matter so much,because our credit history was far more importantthat any kind of peer-to-peer review.But now with the Web, we leave a trail.With every spammer we flag,with every idea we post, comment we share,we're actually signaling how well we collaborate,and whether we can or can't be trusted.Let's go back to my first example,Swaptree.I can see that Rondoronhas completed 553 tradeswith a 100 percent success rate.In other words, I can trust him or her.Now mark my words,it's only a matter of timebefore we're going to be able to perform a Google-like searchand see a cumulative pictureof our reputation capital.And this reputation capitalwill determine our access to collaborative consumption.It's a new social currency, so to speak,that could become as powerful as our credit rating.Now as a closing thought,I believe we're actually in a periodwhere we're waking upfrom this humongous hangoverof emptiness and waste,and we're taking a leapto create a more sustainable systembuilt to serve our innate needsfor community and individual identity.I believe it will be referred toas a revolution, so to speak --when society, faced with great challenges,made a seismic shiftfrom individual getting and spendingtowards a rediscovery of collective good.I'm on a mission to make sharing cool.I'm on a mission to make sharing hip.Because I really believeit can disrupt outdated modes of business,help us leapfrogover wasteful forms of hyper-consumptionand teach us when enough really is enough.Thank you very much.(Applause)

It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland,because until a couple of years ago,people knew hardly anything about us,and I could basically come out hereand say only good things about us.But in the last couple of yearswe've become infamous for a couple of things.First, of course, the economic meltdown.It actually got so badthat somebody put our country up for sale on eBay.(Laughter)Ninety-nine pence was the starting priceand no reserve.Then there was the volcanothat interrupted the travel plansof almost all of you and many of your friends,including President Obama.By the way, the pronunciationis "Eyjafjallajokull."None of your media got it right.(Laughter)But I'm not here to share these storiesabout these two things exactly.I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital,which is a financial firm founded by meand Kristin -- who you see in the picture --in the spring of 2007,just over a year before the economic collapse hit.Why would two womenwho were enjoying successful careers in investment bankingin the corporate sectorleave to found a financial services firm?Well let it suffice to saythat we felt a bit overwhelmedwith testosterone.And I'm not here to saythat men are to blame for the crisisand what happened in my country.But I can surely tell you that in my country,much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere,men were at the helmof the game of the financial sector,and that kind of lack of diversityand samenessleads to disastrous problems.(Applause)So we decided, a bit fed-up with this worldand also with the strong feeling in our stomachthat this wasn't sustainable,to found a financial services firmbased on our values,and we decided to incorporate feminine valuesinto the world of finance.Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland.We weren't knownas the typical "women" womenin Iceland up until then.So it was almost like coming out of the closetto actually talk about the fact that we were womenand that we believed that we had a set of valuesand a way of doing businessthat would be more sustainablethan what we had experienced until then.And we got a great group of people to join us --principled people with great skills,and investors with a visionand values to match ours.And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Icelandwithout taking any direct losses to our equityor to the funds of our clients.And although I want to thankthe talented people of our companyforemost for that --and also there's a factor of luck and timing --we are absolutely convincedthat we did this because of our values.So let me share with you our values.We believe in risk awareness.What does that mean?We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking,and we will not investin things we don't understand.Not a complicated thing.But in 2007,at the height of the sub-primeand all the complicated financial structures,it was quite oppositeto the reckless risk-taking behaviorsthat we saw on the market.We also believe in straight-talking,telling it as it is,using simple language that people understand,telling people about the downsidesas well as the potential upsides,and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter,like our lack of belief in the sustainabilityof the Icelandic financial sectorthat already we hadmonths before the collapse hit us.And, although we do work in the financial sector,where Excel is king,we believe in emotional capital.And we believethat doing emotional due diligenceis just as importantas doing financial due diligence.It is actually peoplethat make money and lose money,not Excel spreadsheets.(Applause)Last, but not least,we believe in profit with principles.We care how we make our profit.So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers,we are willing to do it with a long-term view,and we like to have a wider definition of profitsthan just the economic profit in the next quarter.So we like to see profits,plus positive socialand environmental benefits, when we invest.But it wasn't just about the values,although we are convinced that they matter.It was also about a business opportunity.It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend,that are going to createsome of the most interesting investment opportunitiesin the years to come.The whole thing about the female trendis not about women being better than men;it is actually aboutwomen being different from men,bringing different values and different ways to the table.So what do you get? You get better decision-making,and you get less herd behavior,and both of those things hit your bottom linewith very positive results.But one has to wonder,now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland --and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now,and many would say that you in Americaare heading for some more trouble as well.Now that we've had all that happen,and we have all this data out theretelling us that it's much better to have diversityaround the decision-making tables,will we see business and finance change?Will government change?Well I'll give you my straight talk about this.I have days that I believe,but I have days that I'm full of doubt.Have you seen the incredible urge out thereto rebuild the very things that failed us?(Applause)Einstein saidthat this was the definition of insanity --to do the same thingsover and over again,hoping for a different outcome.So I guess the world is insane,because I see entirely too muchof doing the same things over and over again,hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us.I want to see more revolutionary thinking,and I remain hopeful.Like TED, I believe in people.And I know that consumersare becoming more conscious,and they are going to start voting with their wallets,and they are going to change the faceof business and finance from the outside,if they don't do it from the inside.But I'm more of the revolutionary,and I should be; I'm from Iceland.We have a long historyof strong, courageous, independent women,ever since the Viking age.And I want to tell you whenI first realized that women matter to the economyand to the society,I was seven -- it happened to be my mother's birthday --October 24, 1975.Women in Iceland took the day off.From work or from home, they took the day off,and nothing worked in Iceland.(Laughter)They marched into the center of Reykjavik,and they put women's issues onto the agenda.And some say this was the start of a global movement.For me it was the start of a long journey,but I decided that day to matter.Five years later,Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president --first female to become head of state,single mom,a breast cancer survivorwho had had one of her breasts removed.And at one of the campaign sessions,she had one of her male contendersallude to the fact that she couldn't become president --she was a woman, and even half a woman.That night she won the election,because she came back --not just because of his crappy behavior --but she came back and said,"Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation;I'm going to lead it."(Applause)So I've had incredibly manywomen role modelsthat have influenced who I am and where I am today.But in spite of that,I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my careermostly in denial of being a woman.Started in corporate America,and I was absolutely convincedthat it was just about the individual,that women and men would have just the same opportunities.But I've come to conclude latelythat it isn't like that.We are not the same,and it's great. Because of our differences,we create and sustain life.So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge.The final thought I want to leave with youis that I'm fed up with this tyrannyof either/or choices in life --either it's men or it's women.We need to start embracing the beauty of balance.So let's move awayfrom thinking about business here and philanthropy there,and let's start thinking aboutdoing good business.That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.Thank you.(Applause)

Restaurants and the food industry in generalare pretty much the most wasteful industryin the world.For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today,10 calories are taken to produce it.That's a lot.I want to take something rather humbleto discuss.I found this in the farmers' market today,and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.The humble potato --and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.And it pretty much goes througheight different forms in its lifetime.First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.It grows and is nurtured.It's then harvested.It's then distributed,and distribution is a massive issue.It's then sold and bought,and it's then delivered to me.I basically take it, prepare it,and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it.The last stage is basically waste,and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it.There are different types of waste.There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy;and there's a waste of waste.And every business I've been working onover the past five years,I'm trying to lower each one of these elements.Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like.Basically a restaurant just like any other.This is the restaurant, Acorn House.Front and back.So let me run you through a few ideas.Floor: sustainable, recyclable.Chairs: recycled and recyclable.Tables: Forestry Commission.This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood.This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom --she didn't like sitting on it,so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale --reusing, a job that was pretty good.I hate waste, especially walls.If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did,and that shows all the customers my products.The whole business is run on sustainable energy.This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs.Paint is all low-volume chemical,which is very important when you're working in the room all the time.I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it --but there's a work surface there.And that's a plastic polymer.And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,experiment with polymers.Will they outlive me? They probably might.Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.Now reusing is vital.And we filter our own water.We put them in bottles, refrigerate them,and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.Here's a great little example.If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,which has been turned inside out and sewn up.It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.This is the kitchen, which is in the same room.I basically created a menu that allowed peopleto choose the amount and volume of foodthat they wanted to consume.Rather than me putting a dish down,they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.It serves 220 people a day.We generate quite a lot of waste.This is the waste room.You can't get rid of waste.But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.In here, I have produce and boxesthat are unavoidable.I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator --turns food into an inner material,which I can store and then compost later.I compost it in this garden.All of the soil you can see there is basically my food,which is generated by the restaurant,and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled treesand wine casks and all kinds of things.Three compost bins --go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week --really good, makes fantastic compost.A couple of wormeries in there too.And actually one of the wormerieswas a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.And I tried taking the dried food waste,putting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner."It was like vegetable jerky,and killed all of them.I don't know how many worms [were] in there,but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.(Laughter)What you're seeing here is a water filtration system.This takes the water out of the restaurant,runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there --and I sort of water the garden with it.And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,maybe wash hands with it, I don't know.So, water is a very important aspect.I started meditating on thatand created a restaurant called Waterhouse.If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurantthat is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.I managed to do it.This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House --same chairs, same tables.They're all English and a little bit more sustainable.But this is an electrical restaurant.The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.And it's run on hydroelectricity,so I've gone from air to water.Now it's important to understandthat this roomis cooled by water, heated by water,filters its own water,and it's powered by water.It literally is Waterhouse.The air handling system inside it --I got rid of air-conditioningbecause I thought there was too much consumption going on there.This is basically air-handling.I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.And this is an English willow air diffuser,and that's softly movingthat air current through the room.Very advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it.In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,there is hundreds of meters of coil piping.This takes the temperature of the canaland turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.(Laughter)And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurantlives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.There's no accident in names of these restaurants.Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be makingfive restaurants basedon the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.I've got metal and earth to come.So you've got to watch your space for that.Okay. So this is my next project.Five weeks old,it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.The People's Supermarket.So basically, the restaurants only really hitpeople who believed in what I was doing anyway.What I needed to do was get food outto a broader spectrum of people.So people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class --or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.This is a social enterprise,not-for-profit cooperative supermarket.It really is about the social disconnectbetween food, communitiesin urban settingsand their relationship to rural growers --connecting communities in London to rural growers.Really important.So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff.I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make thisthe most sustainable supermarket in the world.That's zero food waste.And no one's doing that just yet.In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,let's have a go. Try it on.I'm going to get there before you.So nature doesn't create wastedoesn't create waste as such.Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cyclewith waste being the end of the beginning,and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,and it's an important statement to understand.If we don't stand upand make a differenceand think about sustainable food,think about the sustainable nature of it,then we may fail.But, I wanted to get up and show youthat we can do it if we're more responsible.Environmentally conscious businesses are doable.They're here. You can see I've done three so far;I've got a few more to go.The idea is embryonic.I think it's important.I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuseand recycle -- right at the end there --recycling is the last point I want to make;but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's --then I think we're going to be on our way.So these three are not perfect -- they're ideas.I think that there are many problems to come,but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.And I hope you all take part.Thank you very much. (Applause)



birke_baehr_what_s_wrong_with_our_food_system
2041054

Hello. My name is Birke Baehr,and I'm 11 years old.I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system.First of all, I would like to saythat I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believeall the marketing and advertisingon TV, at public schoolsand pretty much everywhere else you look.It seems to me like corporationsare always trying to get kids, like me,to get their parents to buy stuffthat really isn't good for us or the planet.Little kids, especially,are attracted by colorful packagingand plastic toys.I must admit, I used to be one of them.I also used to think that all of our foodcame from these happy, little farmswhere pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.What I discovered was this is not true.I began to look into this stuffon the Internet, in books and in documentary films,in my travels with my family.I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system.First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratoryto do something not intended by nature --like taking the DNA of a fishand putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck.Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes,but this is just creepy.(Laughter)The seeds are then planted, then grown.The food they produce have been provento cause cancer and other problems in lab animals,and people have been eating food produced this waysince the 1990s.And most folks don't even know they exist.Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered cornhad developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity?These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.Yet almost all the corn we eathas been altered genetically in some way.And let me tell you,corn is in everything.And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operationscalled CAFOS.(Laughter)Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizersmade from fossil fuelsthat they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrientsfrom growing the same crop over and over again.Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables,like pesticides and herbicides,to kill weeds and bugs.When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground,or run off into our waterways,poisoning our water too.Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer,so it can travel thousands of milesfrom where it's grown to the supermarkets.So I ask myself,how can I change? How can I change these things?This is what I found out.I discovered that there's a movement for a better way.Now a while back,I wanted to be an NFL football player.I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead.(Applause)Thank you.And that way I can have a greater impact on the world.This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmerbecause he grows against the system.Since I'm home-schooled,I went to go hear him speak one day.This man, this "lunatic farmer,"doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides,or genetically modified seeds.And so for that, he's called crazy by the system.I want you to know that we can all make a differenceby making different choices,by buying our food directly from local farmers,or our neighbors who we know in real life.Some people say organic or local food is more expensive,but is it really?With all these things I've been learning about the food system,it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer,or we can pay the hospital.(Applause)Now I know definitely which one I would choose.I want you to know that there are farms out there --like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee --whose cows do eat grassand whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought.Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer,so I can see up close and personalwhere the meat I eat comes from.I want you to know that I believekids will eat fresh vegetables and good foodif they know more about it and where it really comes from.I want you to know that there are farmers' marketsin every community popping up.I want you to know that me, my brother and sisteractually like eating baked kale chips.I try to share this everywhere I go.Not too long ago,my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal.He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O'sor the sugarcoated flakes --you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.My little cousin told his dadthat he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cerealbecause Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal.And that, my friends, is how we can make a differenceone kid at a time.So next time you're at the grocery store, think local,choose organic, know your farmer and know your food.Thank you.(Applause)

So I'm going to talk about work;which is a problem we all kind of have.But let's sort of start at the beginning.to do great work --I would hope, at least.hopefully great work.And so these companies,they build offices.or they lease some space,and they fill this space with stuff.They fill it with tables, or desks,chairs, computer equipment,software, Internet access,maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,However, if you actually talk to peopleIf you ask people the question:Another one is a moving object,and a third is a time.So here are some examples.the basement,the coffee shop, the library.a plane, a car -- so, the commute.And then you'll hear people say,yet people don't do work in the office.What is that about?(Laughter)Why is that? Why is that happening?And what you find out is,this is what happens:People go to work,and before you know it, it's 5 p.m.,and you look back on the day,We've all been through this.You look back on your day,I used the software they told me to use.But I didn't actually do anything.I just did tasks.to get something done.and really think about a problem.You might have a quick idea,How about seven hours?Six? Five? Four?Two hours? One, maybe?Very, very few people actually haveor they might go to the office,or late at night when no one's around,or go in on the weekends,because there are no distractions.and that is sleep.That's not really what I mean.or stage-based, events.you don't just pick up where you left off.If you're interrupted and woken up,you have to start again.but I didn't really sleep."People say you go "to" sleep,You've got to go through phases and stuff,if they're interrupted all night?I don't think anyone would say yes.Why do we expect people to work wellbecause of these distractions.They'll sometimes also say,But oftentimes they'll cite distractions:"I can't let someone work at home.They'll watch TV, or do this other thing."Because those are voluntary distractions.when you want to turn something on,At the office,most of the interruptions and distractionsSo let's go through a couple of those.that the real distractions at workare things like Facebook and Twitterand YouTube and other websites,because they're on Facebook and Twitter?Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,or Twitter or YouTube here and there?the Managers and the Meetings.it's because of the M&amp;Ms.Now what's interesting is,you don't find managers and meetings.but you do find at the office.which is an interruption.Show me what's up." This sort of thing.they tend to interrupt you.That's kind of bad.which is call meetings.And meetings are just toxic,terrible, poisonous thingsduring the day at work.(Laughter)We all know this to be true,It doesn't work that way.The manager calls the meetingso the employees can all come together,to say, "Hey look,I don't care what you're doing,Because meetings aren't work.you're supposed to be doing later.But meetings also procreate.which leads to another meeting.And so we tend to fill these times upwhen things should go really quickly.especially at offices.What can managers do --enlightened managers, hopefully --so that people start to say,Because the offices are well-equipped;I don't know if people still do that.But how about "No-talk Thursdays?"(Laughter)Pick one Thursday once a month,So just the afternoon, one Thursday.Just silence, that's it.And what you'll findwhen no one talks to each other.It's better than a computer,or whatever people typically use.is going to be incredibly valuable.So maybe it's every other week,or every week, once a week,afternoons no one can talk to each other.Another thing you can try,saying hi to them, having meetings,You can quit I.M.;you can't hide your manager.You can put these things away,So you'll be going up, doing some work,and then you'll come down from that work,So if you're a manager,and other things that someone can put awayAnd the last suggestion I have is that,if you do have a meeting coming up,if you have the power, just cancel it.Just cancel that next meeting.(Laughter)Just don't have it.I don't mean move it;at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,you don't actually have to do.to think about laying off a little bit,I think it'll all pay off in the end.So, thanks for listening.(Applause)

artisanal workshopslike this in China,because the active ingredientcomes from pigs' intestines.Your diamond -- you've all heard, probably seen the movie "Blood Diamond."This is a mine in Zimbabweright now.Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggestexporter of cotton on Earth.Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest,the government shuts down the schools,puts the kids in buses, buses them to the cotton fieldsto spend three weeks harvesting the cotton.It's forced child laboron an institutional scale.And all of those products probably end their livesin a dump like this one in Manila.These places, these origins,represent governance gaps.That's the politest descriptionI have for them.These are the dark poolswhere global supply chains begin --the global supply chains,which bring us our favorite brand name products.Some of these governance gapsare run by rogue states.Some of them are not states anymore at all.They're failed states.Some of themare just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulationis the best way to attract investment,promote trade.Either way, they present uswith a huge moral and ethical dilemma.I know that none of us want to be accessoriesafter the factof a human rights abusein a global supply chain.But right now,most of the companies involved in these supply chainsdon't have any wayof assuring usthat nobody had to mortgage their future,nobody had to sacrifice their rightsto bring us our favoritebrand name product.Now, I didn't come here to depress youabout the state of the global supply chain.We need a reality check.We need to recognize just how seriousa deficit of rights we have.This is an independent republic,probably a failed state.It's definitely not a democratic state.And right now,that independent republic of the supply chainis not being governedin a way that would satisfy us,that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption.Now, that's not a new story.You've seen the documentariesof sweatshops making garmentsall over the world, even in developed countries.You want to see the classic sweatshop,meet me at Madison Square Garden,I'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop.But take the example of heparin.It's a pharmaceutical product.You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital,probably squeaky clean.The problem is that the active ingredient in there --as I mentioned earlier --comes from pigs.The main American manufacturerof that active ingredientdecided a few years ago to relocate to Chinabecause it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs.And their factory in China --which probably is pretty clean --is getting all of the ingredientsfrom backyard abattoirs,where families slaughter pigsand extract the ingredient.So a couple of years ago, we had a scandalwhich killed about 80 people around the world,because of contaminantsthat crept into the heparin supply chain.Worse, some of the suppliersrealized that they could substitute a productwhich mimicked heparin in tests.This substitute cost nine dollars a pound,whereas real heparin, the real ingredient,cost 900 dollars a pound.A no-brainer.The problem was that it killed more people.And so you're asking yourself,"How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationallowed this to happen?How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugsallow this to happen?"And the answer is quite simple:the Chinese define these facilitiesas chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities,so they don't audit them.And the USFDAhas a jurisdictional problem.This is offshore.They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas --about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year.There are 500of these facilitiesproducing active ingredients in China alone.In fact, about 80 percentof the active ingredients in medicines nowcome from offshore,particularly China and India,and we don't have a governance system.We don't have a regulatory systemable to ensurethat that production is safe.We don't have a system to ensurethat human rights, basic dignity,are ensured.So at a national level --and we work in about 60 different countries --at a national levelwe've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governmentsto regulate productionon their own soil.And the real problem with the global supply chainis that it's supranational.So governments who are failing,who are dropping the ballat a national level,have even less ability to get their arms around the problemat an international level.And you can just look at the headlines.Take Copenhagen last year --complete failure of governmentsto do the right thingin the face of an international challenge.Take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago --stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago.You can take any oneof the major global challenges we've discussed this weekand ask yourself, where is the leadership from governmentsto step up and come up with solutions,responses,to those international problems?And the simple answer is they can't. They're national.Their voters are local.They have parochial interests.They can't subordinate those intereststo the greater global public good.So, if we're going to ensure the deliveryof the key public goodsat an international level --in this case, in the global supply chain --we have to come up with a different mechanism.We need a different machine.Fortunately, we have some examples.In the 1990s,there were a whole series of scandalsconcerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. --child labor, forced labor,serious health and safety abuses.And eventually President Clinton, in 1996,convened a meeting at the White House,invited industry, human rights NGOs,trade unions, the Department of Labor,got them all in a roomand said, "Look,I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom.I don't know how to prevent that,but I'm at least going to use my good officesto get you folks togetherto come up with a response."So they formed a White House task force,and they spent about three years arguingabout who takes how much responsibilityin the global supply chain.Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility.They don't own those facilities.They don't employ those workers.They're not legally liable.Everybody else at the tablesaid, "Folks, that doesn't cut it.You have a custodial duty, a duty of care,to make sure that that productgets from wherever to the storein a way that allows us to consume it,without fear of our safety,or without having to sacrifice our conscienceto consume that product."So they agreed, "Okay, what we'll dois we agree on a common set of standards,code of conduct.We'll apply that throughoutour global supply chainregardless of ownership or control.We'll make it part of the contract."And that was a stroke of absolute genius,because what they didwas they harnessed the power of the contract,private power,to deliver public goods.And let's face it,the contract from a major multinational brandto a supplier in India or Chinahas much more persuasive valuethan the local labor law,the local environmental regulations,the local human rights standards.Those factories will probably never see an inspector.If the inspector did come along,it would be amazing if they were ableto resist the bribe.Even if they did their jobs,and they cited those facilities for their violations,the fine would be derisory.But you lose that contractfor a major brand name,that's the differencebetween staying in business or going bankrupt.That makes a difference.So what we've been able to dois we've been able to harnessthe power and the influenceof the only truly transnational institutionin the global supply chain,that of the multinational company,and get them to do the right thing,get them to use that power for good,to deliver the key public goods.Now of course, this doesn't come naturallyto multinational companies.They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money.But they are extremely efficient organizations.They have resources,and if we can add the will, the commitment,they know how to deliver that product.Now, getting there is not easy.Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier,they're not there.You need a safe space.You need a place where people can come together,sit down without fear of judgment,without recrimination,to actually face the problem,agree on the problem and come up with solutions.We can do it. The technical solutions are there.The problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence,the lack of partnershipbetween NGOs, campaign groups,civil society organizationsand multinational companies.If we can put those two together in a safe space,get them to work together,we can deliver public goods right now,or in extremely short supply.This is a radical proposition,and it's crazy to thinkthat if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girlleaving your rural villageto go and work in a factory in Dhaka --22, 23, 24 dollars a month --your best chance of enjoying rights at workis if that factory is producingfor a brand name companywhich has got a code of conductand made that code of conduct part of the contract.It's crazy.Multinationals are protecting human rights.I know there's going to be disbelief.You'll say, "How can we trust them?"Well, we don't.It's the old arms control phrase:"Trust, but verify."So we audit.We take their supply chain, we take all the factory names,we do a random sample,we send inspectors on an unannounced basisto inspect those facilities,and then we publish the results.Transparency is absolutely critical to this.You can call yourself responsible,but responsibility without accountabilityoften doesn't work.So what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals,we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good --respect for human rights --and we're checking.You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me.Go to the website. Look at the audit results.Ask yourself, is this company behavingin a socially responsible way?Can I buy that productwithout compromising my ethics?That's the way the system works.I hate the ideathat governments are not protecting human rights around the world.I hate the ideathat governments have dropped this balland I can't get used to the ideathat somehow we can't get them to do their jobs.I've been at this for 30 years,and in that time I've seenthe ability, the commitment, the will of governmentto do this decline,and I don't see them making a comeback right now.So we started out thinkingthis was a stopgap measure.We're now thinking that, in fact,this is probably the startof a new way of regulating and addressinginternational challenges.Call it network governance. Call it what you will.The private actors,companies and NGOs,are going to have to get togetherto face the major challenges we are going to face.Just look at pandemics --swine flu, bird flu, H1N1.Look at the health systems in so many countries.Do they have the resourcesto face up to a serious pandemic?No.Could the private sector and NGOsget together and marshal a response?Absolutely.What they lack is that safe spaceto come together, agreeand move to action.That's what we're trying to provide.I know as wellthat this often seemslike an overwhelming level of responsibilityfor people to assume."You want me to deliver human rightsthroughout my global supply chain.There are thousands of suppliers in there."It seems too daunting, too dangerous,for any company to take on.But there are companies.We have 4,000 companies who are members.Some of them are very, very large companies.The sporting goods industry, in particular,stepped up to the plate and have done it.The example, the role model, is there.And whenever we discussone of these problems that we have to address --child labor in cottonseed farms in India --this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India.It seems overwhelming.The numbers just make you want to zone out.But we break it down to some basic realities.And human rightscomes down to a very simple proposition:can I give this person their dignity back?Poor people,people whose human rights have been violated --the crux of thatis the loss of dignity,the lack of dignity.It starts with just giving people back their dignity.I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaonjust next to Delhi,one of the flashiest, brightest new citiespopping up in India right now,and I was talking to workerswho worked in garment sweatshops down the road,and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands.They didn't say money.They said, "The people who employ ustreat us like we are less than human,like we don't exist.Please ask them to treat us like human beings."That's my simple understanding of human rights.That's my simple proposition to you,my simple plea to every decision-makerin this room, everybody out there.We can all make a decisionto come togetherand pick up the balls and run with the ballsthat governments have dropped.If we don't do it,we're abandoning hope,we're abandoning our essential humanity,and I know that's not a place we want to be,and we don't have to be there.So I appeal to you.Join us, come into that safe space,and let's start to make this happen.Thank you very much.(Applause)

The big residualis always value for money.All the time we are trying to get value for money.What we don't look foris value for many,while we are generating value for money.Do we care about those four billion peoplewhose income levels are less than two dollars a day,the so-called bottom of the pyramid?What are the challenges in getting value for moneyas well as value for many?We have described herein terms of the performanceand the price.If you have money, of course, you can get the value.You can get a Mercedesfor a very high price,very high performance.But if you don't have money, what happens?Well, you are to ride a bicycle,carrying your own weight and also some other weight,so that you can earn the bread for the day.Well, poor do not remain poor;they become lower-middle-class.And if they do so,then, of course, the conditions improve,and they start riding on scooters.But the challenge is, again, they don't get much value,because they can't afford anything more than the scooter.The issue is, at that price,can you give them some extra value?A super value,in terms of their ability to ride in a car,to get that dignity, to get that safety,looks practically impossible, isn't it.Now, this is somethingthat we see on Indian streetsall the time.But many people see the same thingand think things differently,and one of them is here, Ratan Tata.The great thing about our leadersis that, should they not only have passion in their belly,which practically all of them have,they're also very innovative.An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done.They believe that things can be done.But great leaders like Ratanhave compassion.And what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true:it's not just Ratan Tata,it's the house of Tatas over time.Let me confirm what she said.Yes, I went barefootuntil I was 12.I struggled to [unclear] daywas a huge issue.And when I finished my SSC, the eleventh standard,I stood eleventh among 125,000 students.But I was about to leave the school,because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling.And it was [unclear] Tata Trust, which gave me six rupees per month,almost a dollar per month for six years.That's how I'm standing before you.So that is the House of Tata.(Applause)Innovation, compassion and passion.They combine all that.And it was that compassion which bothered them,because when he saw -- in fact, he told me about eight or nine years agohow he was driving his own car --he drives his own car by the way --and he saw in the rain,a family like the one that I showed to yougetting drenched with an infant.And then he said, "Well, I must give them a car that they can afford,one lakh car, $2,000 car."Of course, as soon as you say something like thispeople say it is impossible,and that's what was said by Suzuki.He said, oh, probably he is going to build a three-wheelerwith stepney.And you can see the cartoon here.Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano.And mind you, I'm six feet half an inch,Ratan is taller than me,and we have ample space in the frontand ample space in the back in this particular car.And incredible car.And of course, nothing succeeds like success;the cynics then turned around,and one after the otherthey also started saying, "Yes, we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment.We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment."How did this great story unfold,the making of Nano?Let me tell you a bit about it.For example, how we started:Ratan just began with a five-engineer team,young people in their mid-twenties.And he said,"Well, I won't define the vehicle for you,but I will define the cost for you.It is one lakh, 100,000 rupees,and you are to make it within that."And he told them,"Question the unquestionable.Stretch the envelope."And at a point in time,he got so engrossed in the whole challenge,that he himself became a member of the team.Can you believe it?I still am told about this storyof that single wiper design in which he participated.Until midnight, he'd be thinking.Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions.But who was the team leader?The team leader was Girish Wagh,a 34 year-old boy in [unclear].And the Nano team average agewas just 27 years.And they did innovation in design and beyond.Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time.For example, that a two-cylinder gas enginewas used in a car with a single balancer shaft.Adhesives were replacing the rivets.There was a co-creation, a huge co-creation,with vendors and suppliers.All ideas on board were welcome.100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant,and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed.Imagine that a fellowwho sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano.I mean, it was incredible innovation.Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors.It was an open innovation,ideas from all over were welcome.The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way,as well as a dashboardthat was inspired by two-wheelers.The fuel lines and lampswere as in two-wheelers.And the crux of the matter was, however,getting more from less.All the time, you have been given an envelope.You can't cross that envelope,which is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars.And therefore, each componenthad to have a dual functionality.And the seat riser, for example,serving as a mounting for the seatas well as a structural partof the functional rigidity.Half the number of partsare contained in Nanoin comparison to a typical passenger car.The length is smaller by eight percent by the way.But the current entry-level carsin comparison to that is eight percent less,but 21 percent more inside space.And what happenedwas that -- more from less --you can see how much more for how much less.When the Model T was launched --and this is, by the way, all the figuresthat are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices --Model T was 19,700 by Ford.Volkswagon was 11,333.And British Motor was around 11,000.And Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars.This is whyyou startedactually a new paradigm shift,where the same peoplewho could not dream of sitting in a car,who were carrying their entire family in a scooter,started dreaming of being in a car.And those dreams are getting fulfilled.This is a photographof a house and a driver and a carnear my own home.The driver's name is Naran.He has bought his own Nano.And you can see, there is a physical spacethat has been created for him,parking that car, along with the owner's car,but more importantly, they've createda space in their mind that"Yes, my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it."And that's why I call it a transformational innovation.It is not just technological,it is social innovation that we talk about.And that is where, ladies and gentlemen,this famous themeof getting more from less for morebecomes important.I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia,about one and a half years ago,when their academy honored me with a fellowship.And unbelievably, in 40 years,I was the first Indian to be honored.And the title of my talkwas therefore "Indian innovationfrom Gandhi to Gandhian engineering."And I titled this more from less for more and more peopleas Gandhian engineering.And Gandhian engineering, in my judgment,is the one which is going to take the world forward,is going to make a difference,not just for a few, but for everyone.Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobilityfor those unfortunateswho have lost their legs.Here is an American citizen and his sonhaving an artificial foot.What is its price? 20,000 dollars.And of course, these feet are so designedthat they can walk only onsuch perfect pavement or roads.Unfortunately, that's not the case in India.You can see him walk barefooton an awkward land, sometimes in a marshy land,and so on and so forth.More importantly,they not only walk far to work,and not only do they cycle to work,but they cycle for work, as you can see here.And they climb up for their work.You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions.A challenge, of course.Four billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day.And if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe,you're talking about 10,000 days of income.You just don't have it.And therefore, you ought to look at alternatives.And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India.It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system,a quick molding and modular components,enabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments.You could feel it actually in an hour, by the way,whereas the equivalent other feettook something like a day, as so on.Outer socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes,rather than using heated sheets.And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks,[unclear] and functions.And I like to show how it looksand how it works.(Music)See, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have.(Text: ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this.... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ..."Did it hurt?""No ... not at all."... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ...)One kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds.(Applause)So that's what it is all about.And therefore Time took noticeof this 28-dollar foot, basically.(Applause)An incredible story.Let's move on to something else.I've been talking about getting more from less for more.Let's move to health.We've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health.What's happening in the area of health?You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs.And if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now,what has happened?10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion.Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars.Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace,after all the human and animal testing,was 10 years, now it is 15 years.Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money?No, I'm sorry.We used to have 40, now they have come down to 30.So actually we are getting less from morefor less and less people.Why less and less people? Because it is so expensive,so very few will be able to basically afford that.Let us just take an example.Psoriasis is very dreadfuldisease of the skin.The cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars.1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way,and 20 of them.Time for development -- it took around 10 yearsand 700 million dollars.Let's start in the spiritof more from less and more for moreand start putting some targets.For example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it.Can we do it [for] 100 dollars?Time for development, not 10 years.We are in a hurry. Five years.Cost of development -- 300 million dollars.Sorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars.Looks absolutely audacious.Looks absolutely ridiculous.You know something? This has been achieved in India.These targets have been achieved in India.And how they have been achieved ...Sir Francis Bacon once said,"When you wish to achieve resultsthat have not been achieved before,it is an unwise fancy to thinkthat they can be achieved by using methodsthat have been used before."And therefore, the standard process,where you develop a molecule, put it into mice, into men,are not yielding those results --the billions of dollars that have been spent.The Indian clevernesswas using its traditional knowledge,however, scientifically validating itand making that journey from men to mice to men,not molecule to mice to men, you know.And that is how this difference has come.And you can see this blendingof traditional medicine, modern medicine, modern science.I launched a big program[unclear] CSIR about nine years ago.He is giving us not just for Psoriasis,for cancer and a whole range of things, changing the whole paradigm.And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthroughobtained by this reverse form of [unclear]by doing things differently.You can see before treatment and after treatment.This is really getting more from less for more and more people,because these are all affordable treatments now.Let me just remind youof what Mahatma Gandhi had said.He had said, "Earth provides enoughto satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed."So the message he was giving uswas you must get more from less and less and lessso that you can share it for more and more people,not only the current generation,but the future generations.And he also said, "I would prize every invention of sciencemade for the benefit for all."So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people,not just a few people.And therefore, ladies and gentlemen,this is the theme, getting morefrom less for more.And mind you,it is not getting just a little more for just a little less.It's not about low cost.It's about ultra-low cost.You cannot say it's a mere treatment 10,000 dollars,but because you are poor I'll give it for 9,000.Sorry, it doesn't work. You have to give it for 100 dollars, 200 dollars.Is it possible? It has been made possible, by the way,for certain other different reasons.So you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost.You are not talking about affordability,you are talking about extreme affordability.Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day.You're not talking exclusive innovation.You're talking about inclusive innovation.And therefore, you're not talking about incremental innovation,you're talking about disruptive innovation.The ideas have to be suchthat you think in completely different terms.And I would also add,it is not only getting more from less for moreby more and more people, the whole world working for it.I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day.You know, incubators for infants, for example.They're not available in Africa.They're not available in Indian villages.And infants die.And incubator costs 2,000 dollars.And there's a 25-dollar incubatorgiving that performance that had been created.And by whom?By young students from Standford Universityon an extreme affordability project that they had, basically.Their heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata.It's not just innovation, compassion and passion --compassion in the heart and passion in the belly.That's the new world that we want to create.And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering.Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end before time.I was also afraid of those 18 minutes.I've still one and a half to go.The message, the final message, is this:India gave a great gift to the world.What was that?[In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world.The 21st century gift,which is very, very important for the whole world,whether it is global economic meltdown,whether it is climate change --any problem that you talk aboutis gaining more from less for more and more --not only the current generations,for the future generations.And that can come only from Gandhian engineering.So ladies and gentlemen, I'm very happy to announce,this gift of the 21st centuryto the world from India,Gandhian engineering.(Applause)Lakshmi Pratury: Thank you, Dr. Mashelkar. (R.A. Mashelkar: Thank you very much.)LP: A quick question for you.Now, when you were a young boy in this school,what were your thoughts, like what did you think you could become?What do you think that drove you?Was there a vision you had? What is it that drove you?RAM: I'll tell you a story that drove me, that transformed my life.I remember, I went to a poor school,because my mother could not gather the 21 rupees,that half a dollar that was requiredwithin the stipulated time.It was [unclear] high school.But it was a poor school with rich teachers, honestly.And one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics.One day he took us out into the sunand tried to show us how to findthe focal length of a convex lens.The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down.And there was a bright spot up there.And then he said, "This is the focal length."But then he held it for a little while, Lakshmi.And then the paper burned.When the paper burned, for some reason he turned to me,and he said, "Mashelkar, like this,if you do not diffuse your energies,if you focus your energies,you can achieve anything in the world."That gave me a great message: focus and you can achieve.I said, "Whoa, science is so wonderful,I have to become a scientist."But more importantly, focus and you can achieve.And that message, very frankly,is valuable for society today.What does that focal length do?It has parallel lines, which are sun rays.And the property of parallel linesis that they never meet.What does that convex lens do?It makes them meet.This is convex lens leadership.You know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length.They divide them farther.So I learned the lessonof convex lens leadership from that.And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory [unclear].When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research --40 laboratories -- when two laboratories were not talking to each other,I would [unclear].And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance,60,000 scientists in nine counties, right from India to the U.S.I'm trying to build a global team,which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing.That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment.LP: Thank you very much. (RAM: Thank you.)(Applause)

The stories we tell about each othermatter very much.The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.And most of all,I think the way that we participate in each other's storiesis of deep importance.I was six years oldwhen I first heard stories about the poor.Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,I heard them from my Sunday school teacherand Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.I remember learning that people who were poorneeded something material --food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.And I also was taught, coupled with that,that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children --it was our job, apparently, to help.This is what Jesus asked of us.And then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me."Now I was pretty psyched.I was very eager to be useful in the world --I think we all have that feeling.And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.That was news to me,and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.But I also learned very soon thereafterthat Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,the poor would always be with us.This frustrated and confused me;I felt like I had been just given a homework assignmentthat I had to do, and I was excited to do,but no matter what I would do, I would fail.So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,like maybe I'd misunderstood something here.And I felt overwhelmed.And for the first time,I began to fear this group of peopleand to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individualsthat were never going away, that would always be with us.They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,which I was excited to do,but I didn't know how it was going to work.And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,especially if the problem was never going away.In the years following,the other stories I heard about the poor growing upwere no more positive.For example, I saw pictures and imagesfrequently of sadness and suffering.I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.I heard about disease, I heard about war --they always seemed to be kind of related.And in general,I got this sort of ideathat the poor in the world lived livesthat were wrought with suffering and sadness,devastation, hopelessness.And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,is this predictable response,where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.And so naturally,I started to distance myself.I stopped listening to their storiesquite as closely as I had before.And I stopped expecting things to really change.Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.I gave of my time and my money,I gave when solutions were on sale.The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.I mean who can argue with that?I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoidand I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enoughthat I gave to relieve my own suffering,not someone else's.The truth be told, I was giving out of that place,not out of a genuine place of hopeand excitement to help and of generosity.It became a transaction for me,became sort of a trade.I was purchasing something --I was buying my right to go on with my dayand not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.And I think the way that we go through that sometimescan, first of all,disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.And it can also turn into a commodity,which is a very scary thing.So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,we kind of buy our distance,we kind of buy our right to go on with our day.I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.It can get in the way of our desireto really be meaningful and useful in another person's lifeand, in short to love.Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for mebecause I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,but to give the shorthand versionfor any who have not heard him speak,Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years agofor his work pioneering modern microfinance.When I heard him speak, it was three years before that.But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well --think of that as financial services for the poor.Think of all the things you get at your bankand imagine those products and servicestailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.Dr. Yunus shared his story,explaining what that was,and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.He also talked about, in particular, microlending,which is a tiny loanthat could help someone start or grow a business.Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the worldthat, for once, showed me, maybe,a way to interact with someoneand to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weirdand didn't make me feel bad --that was exciting.But more importantly, he told stories about the poorthat were different than any stories I had heard before.In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.He was talking about strong, smart,hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every dayand were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it betterwas a little bit of capital.It was an amazing sort of insight for me.And I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this --it's hard to express now how much that affected me --but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,and I moved to East Africato try to see for myself what this was about.For the first time, actually, in a long timeI wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,and see for myself what their lives were actually about.So I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzaniainterviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollarsto start or grow a business.And in fact, through those interactions,for the first time, I was starting to get to be friendswith some of those people in that big amorphous group out therethat was supposed to be far away.I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.And over and over again,as I interviewed them and spent my days with them,I did hear stories of life changeand amazing little details of change.So I would hear from goat herderswho had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.Their business trajectory would change.They would make a little bit more money;their standard of livingwould shift and would get better.And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,like they would start to send their children to school.They might be able to buy mosquito nets.Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their teaand offer that to me when I came as their guestand that made them feel proud.But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,and some days that's what happened --these beautiful details of life changethat were meaningful to them.That was another thing that really touched me.It was really humbling to see for the first time,to really understandthat even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,I probably would have gotten a lot wrong.Because the best way for people to change their livesis for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.So I saw that and it was very humbling.Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.I never once was asked for a donation,which had kind of been my mode, right.There's poverty, you give money to help --no one asked me for a donation.In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing alreadyand to build on their own capabilities.So what I did hear, once in a while,was that people wanted a loan --I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.I just got this impression that the money would work.And my introduction to businesswas in these $100 little infuses of capital.And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.So this ideathat these new stories of business and hopemight be shared with my friends and family,and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they neededto be able to continue their businesses as loans,that's this little idea that turned into Kiva.A few months later, I went back to Ugandawith a digital camera and a basic websitethat my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,and took pictures of seven of my new friends,posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,spammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,but do you say, do you want to help participate in this,provide the money that they need?"The money came in basically overnight.We sent it over to Uganda.And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;the entrepreneurs received the money,they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,and they were able to support themselvesand change the trajectory of their lives.In October of '05,after those first seven loans were paid,Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.We said, "Our little experiment has been a success.Let's start for real." That was our official launch.And then that first year, October '05 through '06,Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.The second year, it was a total of 15 million.The third year, the total was up to around 40.The fourth year, we were just short of 100.And today, less than five years in,Kiva's facilitatedmore than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,from lenders and entrepreneurs --more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.And while those numbers and those statisticsare really fun to talk about and they're interesting,to me, Kiva's really about stories.It's about retellingthe story of the poor,and it's about giving ourselvesan opportunity to engagethat validates their dignity,validates a partnership relationship,not a relationship that's basedon the traditional sort of donor beneficiaryweirdness that can happen.But instead a relationship that can promote respectand hopeand this optimismthat together we can move forward.So what I hope is that,not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva --that's a very positive and meaningful thing --but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,between the traditional rich and poor categoriesthat we're taught to see in the world,this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.Because as that happens,I think we can feel free to interactin a way that's more open, more just and more creative,to engage with each other and to help each other.Imagine how you feelwhen you see somebody on street who is beggingand you're about to approach them.Imagine how you feel;and then imagine the difference when you might see somebodywho has a story of entrepreneurship and hard workwho wants to tell you about their business.Maybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.Imagine if you're speaking with somebodywho's growing things and making them flourish,somebody who's using their talentsto do something productive,somebody who's built their own business from scratch,someone who is surrounded by abundance,not scarcity,who's in fact creating abundance,somebody with full hands with something to offer,not empty handsasking for you to give them something.Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expectof somebody who wakes up every dayand works very, very hard to make their life better.These stories can really change the way that we think about each other.And if we can catalyzea supportive community to come around these individualsand to participate in their storyby lending a little bit of money,I think that can change the way we believe in each otherand each other's potential.Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning.And as I look forward to what is next,it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,have taught me what entrepreneurship is.And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.You see an opportunityand you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than todayand going after that.Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.So they're not a donation.Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.But in fact, when you give something to someoneand they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go,that's one thing.When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.This continued attention -- this ongoing attention --is a really big dealto build different kinds of relationships among us.And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,when all else is equal,given the option to have just money to do what you need to do,or money plus the support and encouragementof a global community,people choose the community plus the money.That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.So with that in mind, this particular incidenthas led to the things that I'm working on now.I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.And one thing that I've seenis there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.With social networks,it's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around usin our own supportive communities, rapidly.And so, as I have been thinking about this,I've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communitiesto catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideasand to catalyze all of usto make tomorrow better than today?As I've researched what's going on in the United States,a few interesting little insights have come up.So one is that, of course, as we all might expect,many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the worldstill need money to grow and to do more of what they want to door they might need money during a hard month.But there's always a need for resources close by.Another thing is, it turns out,those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect --banks, venture capitalists,other organizations and support structures --they come from friends and family.Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businessescomes from friends and family.That's around 130 billion dollars a year --it's a lot.And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,it's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,how to ask, what to promise in return,even though they have the best of intentionsand want to thank those people that are supporting them.So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new wayand to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselvesexactly what that financial exchange should look like,exactly what fits them and the people around them,this week actually,we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they needthrough investments from their friends and family.And it's investments, not donations, not loans,but investments that have a dynamic return.So the mapping of participating in the story,it actually flows with the up and down.So in short, it's a do-it-yourself toolfor small businesses to raise these funds.And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,create investment terms in a really easy way.We make it really, really simple for meas well as anyone else who wants to use the site.And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.They can raise up to a million dollarsfrom an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors --everyday people, heaven forbid --and they can share those returns over time --again, whatever terms they set.As investors choose to become involvedbased on those terms,they can either take their rewards back as cash,or they can decide in advanceto give those returns away to a non-profit.So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an ideaa path to go do what they want to do in the worldand to gather the people around them that they already have,the people that know them bestand that love them and want to support them,to gather them to make this happen.So that's what I'm working on now.And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,just like they've cared enough to use Kivato make those connections.But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care --I'm not even going to try.I don't think, even though we often hear,you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,the religious reasons,"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier."I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know;in fact, I think we know so much,and it's such a realitythat we care so deeply,that in fact, what usually stops usis that we're afraid to try and to mess up,because we care so very much about helping each otherand being meaningful in each other's lives.So what I think I can do today,that best thing I can give you --I've given you my story, which is the best I can do.And I think I can remind us that we do care.I think we all already know that.And I think we know that love is resilient enoughfor us to get out there and try.Just a sec.(Applause)Thanks.(Applause)Thanks.(Applause)For me, the best way to be inspired to tryis to stop and to listento someone else's story.And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED.And I'm grateful that whenever I do that,guaranteed, I am inspired --I am inspired by the person I am listening to.And I believe more and more every time I listenin that that person's potential to do great things in the worldand in my own potential to maybe help.And that --forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources --that stuff's easy.Believing in each other,really being sure when push comes to shovethat each one of us can do amazing things in the world,that is what can make our stories into love storiesand our collective storyinto one that continually perpetuates hopeand good things for all of us.So that, this belief in each other,knowing that without a doubtand practicing that every day in whatever you do,that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.Thank you.(Applause)

I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype.My wife sent me a message,"Whoa, earthquake,"and then disappeared for 25 minutes.It was 25 minutes of absolute terrorthat thousands of people across the U.S. felt.I was afraid of a tsunami;what I didn't realizewas there was a greater terror in Haiti,and that was building collapse.We've all seen the photosof the collapsed buildings in Haiti.These are shots my wife tooka couple days after the quake,while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country.This is the national palace --the equivalent of the White House.This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbeanat peak shopping time.This is a nurses' college --there are 300 nurses studying.The general hospital right next dooremerged largely unscathed.This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.We have all heardabout the tremendous human lossin the earthquake in Haiti,but we haven't heard enoughabout why all those lives were lost.We haven't heard aboutwhy the buildings failed.After all, it was the buildings,not the earthquake,that killed 220,000 people,that injured 330,000,that displaced 1.3 million people,that cut off foodand water and suppliesfor an entire nation.This is the largest metropolitan-area disasterin decades,and it was not a natural disaster --it was a disaster of engineering.AIDG has worked in Haitisince 2007,providing engineering and business supportto small businesses.And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineersto figure out why the buildings collapsed,to examine what was safe and what wasn't.Working with MINUSTAH,which is the U.N. mission in Haiti,with the Ministry of Public Works,with different NGOs,we inspected over 1,500 buildings.We inspected schoolsand private residencies.We inspected medical centersand food warehouses.We inspected government buildings.This is the Ministry of Justice.Behind that dooris the National Judicial Archives.The fellow in the door, Andre Filitrault --who's the directorof the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Researchat the University of Buffalo --was examining it to see if it was safeto recover the archives.Andre told me,after seeing these buildings failagain and again in the same way,that there is no new research here.There is nothing here that we don't know.The failure points were the same:walls and slabs not tied properly into columns --that's a roof slab hanging off the building --cantilevered structures,or structures that were asymmetric,that shook violently and came down,poor building materials,not enough concrete,not enough compression in the blocks,rebar that was smooth,rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.Now there's a solutionto all these problems.And we know how to build properly.The proof of this came in Chile,almost a month later,when 8.8 magnitude earthquakehit Chile.That is 500 timesthe power of the 7.0that hit Port-au-Prince --500 times the power,yet only under a thousand casualties.Adjusted for population density,that is less than one percentof the impact of the Haitian quake.What was the differencebetween Chile and Haiti?Seismic standardsand confined masonry,where the building acts as a whole --walls and columnsand roofs and slabstied together to support each other --instead of breaking off into separate members and failing.If you look at this building in Chile,it's ripped in half,but it's not a pile of rubble.Chileans have been building with confined masonryfor decades.Right now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers,Architecture for Humanity,to bring more confined masonry traininginto Haiti.This is Xantus Daniel;he's a mason,just a general construction worker, not a foreman,who took one of our trainings.On his last job he was working with his boss,and they started pouring the columns wrong.He took his boss aside,and he showed him the materials on confined masonry.He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong.It won't cost us any moreto do it the right way."And they redid that building.They tied the rebar right,they poured the columns right,and that building will be safe.And every buildingthat they build going forwardwill be safe.To make sure these buildings are safe,it's not going to take policy --it's going to take reaching outto the masons on the groundand helping them learn the proper techniques.Now there are many groups doing this.And the fellow in the vest there,Craig Toten,he has pushed forwardto get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this.Through Haiti Rewired,through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity,AIDG,there is the possibilityto reach outto 30,000 -- 40,000 masonsacross the countryand create a movement of proper building.If you reach out to the people on the groundin this collaborative wayit's extremely affordable.For the billions spent on reconstruction,you can train masonsfor dollars on every housethat they end up building over their lifetime.Ultimately, there are two waysthat you can rebuild Haiti;the way at the topis the way that Haiti's been building for decades.The way at the topis a poorly constructed buildingthat will fail.The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building,where the walls are tied together,the building is symmetric,and it will stand up to an earthquake.For all the disaster,there is an opportunity hereto build better housesfor the next generation,so that when the next earthquake hits,it is a disaster --but not a tragedy.(Applause)

One of my favorite partsof my job at the Gates Foundationis that I get to travel to the developing world,and I do that quite regularly.And when I meet the mothersin so many of these remote places,I'm really struck by the thingsthat we have in common.They want what we want for our childrenand that is for their children to grow up successful,to be healthy, and to have a successful life.But I also see lots of poverty,and it's quite jarring,both in the scale and the scope of it.My first trip in India, I was in a person's homewhere they had dirt floors, no running water,no electricity,and that's really what I see all over the world.So in short, I'm startled by all the thingsthat they don't have.But I am surprised by one thing that they do have:Coca-Cola.Coke is everywhere.In fact, when I travel to the developing world,Coke feels ubiquitous.And so when I come back from these trips,and I'm thinking about development,and I'm flying home and I'm thinking,"We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations,"you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder:how is it that they can get Coketo these far-flung places?If they can do that,why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?And I'm not the first person to ask this question.But I think, as a community,we still have a lot to learn.It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.They sell 1.5 billion servingsevery single day.That's like every man, woman and child on the planethaving a serving of Coke every week.So why does this matter?Well, if we're going to speed up the progressand go even fasteron the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world,we need to learn from the innovators,and those innovatorscome from every single sector.I feel that, if we can understandwhat makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous,we can apply those lessons then for the public good.Coke's success is relevant,because if we can analyze it, learn from it,then we can save lives.So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.And I think there are really three thingswe can take away from Coca-Cola.They take real-time dataand immediately feed it back into the product.They tap into local entrepreneurial talent,and they do incredible marketing.So let's start with the data.Now Coke has a very clear bottom line --they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.So they take the data,and they use it to measure progress.They have this very continuous feedback loop.They learn something, they put it back into the product,they put it back into the market.They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."It's a lot like other consumer companies.So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola,and you have a 107 constituencies,you know where every can versus bottleof Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold,whether it was a corner store,a supermarket or a pushcart.So if sales start to drop,then the person can identify the problemand address the issue.Let's contrast that for a minute to development.In development, the evaluation comesat the very end of the project.I've sat in a lot of those meetings,and by then,it is way too late to use the data.I had somebody from an NGOonce describe it to me as bowling in the dark.They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on,and then you an see your impact."Real-time dataturns on the lights.So what's the second thing that Coke's good at?They're good at tapping intothat local entrepreneurial talent.Coke's been in Africa since 1928,but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets,because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world,which was a large truck rolling down the street.And in Africa, the remote places,it's hard to find a good road.But Coke noticed something --they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulkand then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.And they decided in 1990that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs,giving them small loans.They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers,and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people,who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrowsto sell the product.There are now some 3,000 of these centersemploying about 15,000 people in Africa.In Tanzania and Uganda,they represent 90 percentof Coke's sales.Let's look at the development side.What is it that governments and NGOscan learn from Coke?Governments and NGOsneed to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well,because the locals know how to reachthe very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors,and they know what motivates them to make change.I think a great example of thisis Ethiopia's new health extension program.The government noticed in Ethiopiathat many of the people were so far away from a health clinic,they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby --forget it, to get to the health care center.They decided that wasn't good enough,so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Keralathat also had a system like this,and they adapted it for Ethiopia.And in 2003, the government of Ethiopiastarted this new system in their own country.They trained 35,000 health extension workersto deliver care directly to the people.In just five years,their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 peopleto one worker for every 2,500 people.Now, think abouthow this can change people's lives.Health extension workers can help with so many things,whether it's family planning, prenatal care,immunizations for the children,or advising the woman to get to the facility on timefor an on-time delivery.That is having real impactin a country like Ethiopia,and it's why you see their child mortality numberscoming down 25 percentfrom 2000 to 2008.In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children livingbecause of this health extension worker program.So what's the next step for Ethiopia?Well, they're already starting talk about this.They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workersgenerate their own ideas?How do you incent them based on the impact that they're gettingout in those remote villages?"That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talentand you unlock people's potential.The third component of Coke's successis marketing.Ultimately, Coke's successdepends on one crucial factand that is that people wanta Coca-Cola.Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurscan sell or make a profitis they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.So, they rely on Coca-Colain terms of its marketing,and what's the secret to their marketing?Well, it's aspirational.It is associated that productwith a kind of life that people want to live.So even though it's a global company,they take a very local approach.Coke's global campaign sloganis "Open Happiness."But they localize it.And they don't just guess what makes people happy;they go to places like Latin Americaand they realize that happiness thereis associated with family life.And in South Africa,they associate happinesswith seriti or community respect.Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it,"Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.(Video) K'Naan: ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♫♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫♫Give you freedom, give you fire♫♫ Give you reason, take you higher ♫♫ See the champions take the field now ♫♫ You define us, make us feel proud ♫♫ In the streets our heads are lifted ♫♫ As we lose our inhibition ♫♫ Celebration, it's around us ♫♫ Every nation, all around us ♫Melinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?Well, they didn't stop there --they localized it into 18 different languages.And it went number one on the pop chartin 17 countries.It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood,"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,"that also went number one on the pop charts.Both songs have something in common:that same appealof celebration and unity.So how does health and development market?Well, it's based on avoidance,not aspirations.I'm sure you've heard some of these messages."Use a condom, don't get AIDS.""Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea."It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me.And I think we make a fundamental mistake --we make an assumption,that we think that, if people need something,we don't have to make them want that.And I think that's a mistake.And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.One example is sanitation.We know that a million and a half childrendie a year from diarrheaand a lot of it is because of open defecation.But there's a solution: you build a toilet.But what we're finding around the world, over and over again,is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there,it doesn't get used.People reuse it for a slab for their home.They sometimes store grain in it.I've even seen it used for a chicken coop.(Laughter)But what does marketing really entailthat would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?Well, you work with the community.You start to talk to them about why open defecationis something that shouldn't be done in the village,and they agree to that.But then you take the toilet and you position itas a modern, trendy convenience.One state in Northern India has gone so faras to link toilets to courtship.And it works -- look at these headlines.(Laughter)I'm not kidding.Women are refusing to marry men without toilets.No loo, no "I do."(Laughter)Now, it's not just a funny headline --it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign.But more importantly,it saves lives.Take a look at this --this is a room full of young menand my husband, Bill.And can you guess what the young men are waiting for?They're waiting to be circumcised.Can you you believe that?We know that circumcision reduces HIV infectionby 60 percent in men.And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation,I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bitand we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"But it turns out the men do,because they're hearing from their girlfriendsthat they prefer it,and the men also believe it improves their sex life.So if we can start to understandwhat people really wantin health and development,we can change communitiesand we can change whole nations.Well, why is all of this so important?So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together,when you tie the three things together.And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.So if you look back to 1988,there are about 350,000 cases of polioon the planet that year.In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.Well how did that happen?Let's look at a country like India.They have over a billion people in this country,but they have 35,000 local doctorswho report paralysis,and clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.They have two and a half million vaccinators.But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.Let me tell you the story of Shriram,an 18 month boy in Bihar,a northern state in India.This year on August 8th, he felt paralysisand on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample,and by the 25th of August,it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.By August 30th, a genetic test was done,and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.Now it could have come from one of two places.It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border,or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.Luckily, the genetic testing provedthat, in fact, this strand came north,because, had it come from the south,it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.So many more people would have been affected.So what's the endgame?Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign,which is what you do in polio.They went out and where Shriram lives,they vaccinated two million people.So in less than a month,we went from one case of paralysisto a targeted vaccination program.And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.That's how you keepa huge outbreak from spreading,and it shows what can happenwhen local people have the data in their hands;they can save lives.Now one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing,but it might not be what you think.It's not the marketing on the ground.It's not telling the parents,"If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctoror get your child vaccinated."We have a problem with marketing in the donor community.The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polioover the last 20 years,but we're starting to have something called polio fatigueand that is that the donor nationsaren't willing to fund polio any longer.So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.So we are 99 percentof the way there on this goaland we're about to run short of money.And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational,if we could focus as a communityon how far we've comeand how amazing it would beto eradicate this disease,we could put polio fatigueand polio behind us.And if we could do that,we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide,in all of our countries for polio.And it would only be the second disease everwiped off the face of the planet.And we are so close.And this victory is so possible.So if Coke's marketers came to meand asked me to define happiness,I'd say my vision of happinessis a mother holding healthy babyin her arms.To me, that is deep happiness.And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector,then in the future we make together,that happinesscan be just as ubiquitousas Coca-Cola.Thank you.(Applause)

Hello. I would like to start my talkwith actually two questions, and the first one is:How many people here actually eat pig meat?Please raise your hand --oh, that's a lot.And how many people have actually seena live pig producing this meat?In the last year?In the Netherlands -- where I come from --you actually never see a pig, which is really strange,because, on a population of 16 million people,we have 12 million pigs.And well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs.They eat about one-third, and the rest is exportedto all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world.A lot goes to the U.K., Germany.And what I was curious about --because historically, the whole pig would be used up until the last bitso nothing would be wasted --and I was curious to find outif this was actually still the case.And I spent about three years researching.And I followed this one pigwith number "05049,"all the way up until the endand to what products it's made of.And in these years, I met all kinds peoplelike, for instance, farmers and butchers, which seems logical.But I also met aluminum mold makers,ammunition producersand all kinds of people.And what was striking to meis that the farmers actually had no cluewhat was made of their pigs,but the consumers -- as in us --had also no ideaof the pigs being in all these products.So what I did is,I took all this researchand I made it into a -- well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig,and it carries a duplicate of his ear tagon the back.And it consists of seven chapters --the chapters are skin, bones, meat, internal organs,blood, fat and miscellaneous.(Laughter)In total,they weigh 103.7 kilograms.And to show you how often you actuallymeet part of this pig in a regular day,I want to show you some images of the book.You probably start the day with a shower.So, in soap, fatty acidsmade from boiling pork bone fatare used as a hardening agent,but also for giving it a pearl-like effect.Then if you look around you in the bathroom,you see lots more productslike shampoo, conditioner,anti-wrinkle cream, body lotion,but also toothpaste.Then, so, before breakfast,you've already met the pig so many times.Then, at breakfast, the pig that I followed,the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pigwere used as an improver of dough.(Laughter)Well, that's what the producer says: it's "improving the dough,of course."In low-fat butter, or actually in many low-fat products,when you take the fat out, you actually take the taste and the texture out.So what they do is they put gelatin back in,in order to retain the texture.Well, when you're off to work, under the road or under the buildings that you see,there might very well be cellular concrete,which is a very light kind of concretethat's actually got proteins from bones insideand it's also fully reusable.In the train brakes -- at least in the German train brakes --there's this part of the brakethat's made of bone ash.And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts,like chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding,everything that's cooled in the supermarket,there's gelatin to make it look good.Fine bone china -- this is a real classic.Of course, the bone in fine-bone chinagives it its translucencyand also its strength,in order to make these really fine shapes,like this deer.In interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there.It's used in paint for the texture,but also for the glossiness.In sandpaper, bone glueis actually the glue between the sand and the paper.And then in paintbrushes,hairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushesbecause of their hard-wearing nature.I was not planning on showing you any meatbecause, of course, half the book's meatand you probably all know what meats they are.But I didn't want you to miss out on this one,because this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts."And this is actually soldin the frozen area of the supermarket.And what it is -- it's actually steak.So, this is sold as cow,but what happens when you slaughter a cow --at least in industrial factory farming --they have all these little bits of steak leftthat they can't actually sell as steak,so what they do is they glue them all togetherwith fibrin from pig bloodinto this really large sausage,then freeze the sausage, cut it in little slicesand sell those as steak again.And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops.So, with the steak, you might drink a beer.In the brewing process, there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer,so to get rid of these cloudy elements,what some companies dois they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sievein order to get rid of that cloudiness.This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice.There's actually a company in Greecethat produces these cigarettesthat actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter.And according to them,this creates an artificial lung in the filter.(Laughter)So, this is actually a healthier cigarette.(Laughter)Injectable collagen -- or, since the '70s, collagen from pigs --has been used for injecting into wrinkles.And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings,so the collagen is as well.Well, this must be the strangest thing I found.This is a bullet coming froma very large ammunition company in the United States.And while I was making the book,I contacted all the producers of productsbecause I wanted them to send me the real samplesand the real specimens.So I sent this company an emailsaying, "Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research.And can you send me a bullet?"(Laughter)And well, I didn't expect them to even answer my email.But they answeredand they said, "Why, thank you for your email. What an interesting story.Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government?"I thought that was really weird,as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone.(Laughter)So, the most beautiful thing I found --at least what I think is the most beautiful -- in the book, is this heart valve.It's actually a very low-techand very high-tech product at the same time.The low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valvemounted in the high-tech bit,which is a memory metal casing.And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heartwithout open heart surgery.And once it's in the right spot,they remove the outer shell,and the heart valve, well, it gets this shapeand at that moment it starts beating, instantly.It's really a sort of magical moment.So this is actually a Dutch company,so I called them up, and I asked,"Can I borrow a heart valve from you?"And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic.So they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin,and you can borrow it."Great -- and then I didn't hear from them for weeks,so I called,and I asked, "What's going on with the heart valve?"And they said, "Well the director of the companydecided not to let you borrow this heart valve,because want his productto be associated with pigs."(Laughter)Well, the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy --actually, to show that my first question,if pigs are still used up until the last bit, was still true.Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything elseis made into a fuelthat can be used as renewable energy source.In total, I found 185 products.And what they showed meis that, well, firstly,it's at least to say oddthat we don't treat these pigsas absolute kings and queens.And the second, is that we actually don't have a clueof what all these products that surround us are made of.And you might think I'm very fond of pigs,but actually -- well, I am a little bit --but I'm more fondof raw materials in general.And I think that, in order to take better careof what's behind our products --so, the livestock, the crops, the plants,the non-renewable materials,but also the people that produce these products --the first step would actually be to know that they are there.Thank you very much.(Applause)

If nothing else, at least I've discoveredwhat it is we put our speakers through:sweaty palms, sleepless nights,a wholly unnatural fear of clocks.I mean, it's quite brutal.And I'm also a little nervous about this.There are nine billion humans coming our way.Now, the most optimistic dreamscan get dented by the prospectof people plundering the planet.But recently, I've become intriguedby a different way of thinking of large human crowds,because there are circumstanceswhere they can do something really cool.It's a phenomenon that I thinkany organization or individual can tap into.It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future,and perhaps the world's future overall.So, let's explore.The story starts with just a single person,a child, behaving a little strangely.This kid is known online as Lil Demon.He's doing tricks here, dance tricks,that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before.How did he learn them?And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practicethis must have taken?Here's a clue.(Video) Lil Demon: ♫ Step your game up. Oh. Oh. ♫♫ Step your game up. Oh. Oh. ♫Chris Anderson: So, that was sent to me by this man,a filmmaker, Jonathan Chu,who told me that was the moment he realizedthe Internet was causing dance to evolve.This is what he said at TED in February.In essence,dancers were challenging each other online to get better;incredible new dance skills were being invented;even the six-year-olds were joining in.It felt like a revolution.And so Jon had a brilliant idea:He went out to recruit the best of the best dancersoff of YouTubeto create this dance troupe --The League of Extraordinary Dancers, the LXD.I mean, these kids were web-taught,but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year.And at TED here in February,their passion and brilliance just took our breath away.So, this storyof the evolution of danceseems strangely familiar.You know, a while after TEDTalks started taking off,we noticed that speakerswere starting to spend a lot more time in preparation.It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two.... Months of preparationcrammed into 18 minutes,raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers,with the effects that we've seen this week.It's not as if J.J. and Jillactually ended their talks saying, "Step your game up,"but they might as well have.So, in both of these cases,you've got these cycles of improvement,apparently drivenby people watching web video.What is going on here?Well, I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call"crowd-accelerated innovation."And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear.You can think of themas three dials on a giant wheel.You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn.And the first thing you need is ... a crowd,a group of people who share a common interest.The bigger the crowd,the more potential innovators there are.That's important, but actually most people in the crowdoccupy these other roles.They're creating the ecosystemfrom which innovation emerges.The second thing you need is light.You need clear, open visibilityof what the best people in that crowd are capable of,because that is how you will learnhow you will be empowered to participate.And third, you need desire.You know, innovation's hard work.It's based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice.Absent desire, not going to happen.Now, here's an example -- pre-Internet --of this machine in action.Dancers at a street corner --it's a crowd, a small one,but they can all obviously see what each other can do.And the desire part comes, I guess,from social status, right?Best dancer walks tall, gets the best date.There's probably going to be some innovation happening here.But on the web,all three dials are ratcheted right up.The dance community is now global.There's millions connected.And amazingly,you can still see what the best can do,because the crowd itself shines a light on them,either directly, through comments, ratings,email, Facebook, Twitter,or indirectly,through numbers of views,through links that point Google there.So, it's easy to find the good stuff,and when you've found it, you can watch it in close-up repeatedlyand read what hundreds of people have written about it.That's a lot of light.But the desire elementis really dialed way up.I mean, you might just be a kid with a webcam,but if you can do something that goes viral,you get to be seen by the equivalentof sports stadiums crammed with people.You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you.And even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not --it can still really make your day.So, this possibilityof a new type of global recognition,I think, is driving huge amounts of effort.And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting:because you can see the best, everyone can learn.Also, the system is self-fueling.It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire,but the light and desire are a lethal one-two combinationthat attract new people to the crowd.So, this is a modelthat pretty much any organization could useto try and nurture its own cycleof crowd-accelerated innovation.Invite the crowd, let in the light,dial up the desire.And the hardest part about that is probably the light,because it means you have to open up,you have to show your stuff to the world.It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secretthat maybe millions of peopleare empowered to help improve it.And, very happily, there's one class of peoplewho really can't make use of this tool.The dark side of the webis allergic to the light.I don't think we're going to see terrorists, for example,publishing their plans online and saying to the world,"Please, could you help us to actuallymake them work this time?"But you can publish your stuff online.And if you can get that wheel to turn,look out.So, at TED,we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness.In fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it "radical openness,"because it works for us each time.We opened up our talks to the world,and suddenly there are millions of people out therehelping spread our speakers' ideas,and thereby making it easier for usto recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers.By opening up our translation program,thousands of heroic volunteers --some of them watching online right now, and thank you! --have translated our talksinto more than 70 languages,thereby tripling our viewership in non-English-speaking countries.By giving away our TEDx brand,we suddenly have a thousand-pluslive experiments in the art of spreading ideas.And these organizers,they're seeing each other, they're learning from each other.We are learning from them.We're getting great talks back from them.The wheel is turning.Okay, step back a minute.I mean, it's really not news for me to tell youthat innovation emerges out of groups.You know, we've heard that this week --this romantic notion of the lone geniuswith the "eureka!" moment that changes the worldis misleading.Even he said that, and he would know.We're a social species.We spark off each other.It's also not newsto say that the Internet has accelerated innovation.For the past 15 years,powerful communities have been connecting online,sparking off each other.If you take programmers,you know, the whole open-source movementis a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation.But what's key here is,the reason these groups have been able to connectis because their work output is of the typethat can be easily shared digitally --a picture, a music file,software.And that's why what I'm excited about,and what I think is under-reported,is the significance of the riseof online video.This is the technologythat's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally,thereby launching a whole new cycleof crowd-accelerated innovation.The first few years of the webwere pretty much video-free,for this reason: video files are huge; the web couldn't handle them.But in the last 10 years,bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold.Suddenly, here we are.Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day.Cisco actually estimates that, within four years,more than 90 percent of the web's data will be video.If it's all puppies, porn and piracy,we're doomed.I don't think it will be.Video is high-bandwidth for a reason.It packs a huge amount of data,and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it.Here, let me introduce you to Sam Haber.He's a unicyclist.Before YouTube,there was no way for him to discoverhis sport's true potential,because you can't communicate this stuff in words, right?But looking at video clips posted by strangers,a world of possibility opens up for him.Suddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate.And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online,inspire each other to greatness.And there are thousands of other examples of this happening --of video-driven evolution of skills,ranging from the physical to the artful.And I have to tell you,as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines,I find this strangely beautiful.I mean, there's a lot of passion right here on this screen.But if Rube Goldberg machinesand video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea,how about this.Jove is a websitethat was founded to encourage scientiststo publish their peer-reviewed researchon video.There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper.It can take months for a scientist in another labto figure out how to replicate the experimentsthat are described in print.Here's one such frustrated scientist,Moshe Pritsker, the founder of Jove.He told me that the world is wastingbillions of dollars on this.But look at this video.I mean, look: if you can showinstead of just describing,that problem goes away.So it's not far-fetched to saythat, at some point,online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance.Here's another examplethat's close to our hearts at TED,where video is sometimes more powerful than print --the sharing of an idea.Why do people like watching TEDTalks?All those ideas are already out there in print.It's actually faster to read than to view.Why would someone bother?Well, so, there's some showing as well as telling.But even leaving the screen out of it,there's still a lot more being transferred than just words.And in that non-verbal portion, there's some serious magic.Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures,the vocal cadence, the facial expressions,the eye contact,the passion,the kind of awkward, British body language,the sense of how the audience are reacting,there are hundreds of subconscious cluesthat go to how well you will understand,and whether you're inspired --light, if you like,and desire.Incredibly, all of this can be communicatedon just a few square inches of a screen.Reading and writing are actuallyrelatively recent inventions.Face-to-face communication has been fine-tunedby millions of years of evolution.That's what's made it into this mysterious, powerful thing it is.Someone speaks,there's resonance in all these receiving brains,the whole group acts together.I mean, this is the connective tissueof the human superorganism in action.It's probably driven our culture for millennia.500 years ago, it ran intoa competitor with a lethal advantage.It's right here.Print scaled.The world's ambitious innovators and influencersnow could get their ideas to spread far and wide,and so the art of the spoken wordpretty much withered on the vine.But now, in the blink of an eye,the game has changed again.It's not too much to saythat what Gutenberg did for writing,online video can now do for face-to-face communication.So, that primal medium,which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...that just went global.Now, this is big.We may have to reinvent an ancient art form.I mean, today, one person speakingcan be seen by millions,shedding bright light on potent ideas,creating intense desirefor learning and to respond --and in his case, intense desire to laugh.For the first time in human history,talented studentsdon't have to have their potential and their dreamswritten out of history by lousy teachers.They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest.Now, TED is just a small part of this.I mean, the world's universities are opening up their curricula.Thousands of individuals and organizationsare sharing their knowledge and data online.Thousands of people are figuring out new waysto learn and, crucially,to respond, completing the cycle.And so, as we've thought about this,you know, it's become clear to uswhat the next stage of TED's evolution has to be.TEDTalks can't be a one-way process, one-to-many.Our future is many-to-many.So, we're dreaming of waysto make it easier for you, the global TED community,to respond to speakers,to contribute your own ideas,maybe even your own TEDTalks,and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there.Because, if we can bubble up the very bestfrom a vastly larger pool,this wheel turns.Now, is it possible to imaginea similar process to this,happening to global education overall?I mean, does it have to be this painful,top-down process?Why not a self-fueling cyclein which we all can participate?It's the participation age, right?Schools can't be silos.We can't stop learning at age 21.What if, in the coming crowd of nine billion ...what if that crowd could learn enoughto be net contributors,instead of net plunderers?That changes everything, right?I mean, that would take more teachers than we've ever had.But the good news is they are out there.They're in the crowd,and the crowd is switching on lights,and we can see them for the first time,not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers,but as individuals we can learn from.Who's the teacher?You're the teacher.You're part of the crowdthat may be about to launchthe biggest learning cycle in human history,a cycle capable of carrying all of usto a smarter, wiser, more beautiful place.Here's a group of kids in a village in Pakistannear where I grew up.Within five years, each of these kids is going to have accessto a cellphone capable of full-on web videoand capable of uploading video to the web.I mean, is it crazy to think that this girl,in the back, at the right, in 15 years,might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautifulfor your grandchildren?It's not crazy; it's actually happening right now.I want to introduce you to a good friend of TEDwho just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown.(Video) Christopher Makau: Hi. My name is Christopher Makau.I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera.There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera.There's a self-help group.They turned a trash place into a garden.The same spot, it was a crime spotwhere people were being robbed.They used the same trashto form green manure.The same trash siteis feeding more than 30 families.We have our own film school.They are using Flip camerasto record, edit,and reporting to their own channel,Kibera TV.Because of a scarcity of land,we are using the sacks to grow vegetables,and also [we're] able to save on the cost of living.Change happens when we see things in a different way.Today, I see Kibera in a different way.My message to TEDGlobaland the entire world is:Kibera is a hotbedof innovation and ideas.(Applause)CA: You know what?I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy.What's new -- and it's huge --is that, for the first time, we get to see him,and he can see us.Right now, Chris and Kevinand Dennis and Dickson and their friendsare watching us, in Nairobi, right now.Guys,we've learned from you today.Thank you.And thank you.(Applause)

pretty much any organization could useto try and nurture its own cycleof crowd-accelerated innovation.Invite the crowd, let in the light,dial up the desire.And the hardest part about that is probably the light,because it means you have to open up,you have to show your stuff to the world.It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secretthat maybe millions of peopleare empowered to help improve it.And, very happily, there's one class of peoplewho really can't make use of this tool.The dark side of the webis allergic to the light.I don't think we're going to see terrorists, for example,publishing their plans online and saying to the world,"Please, could you help us to actuallymake them work this time?"But you can publish your stuff online.And if you can get that wheel to turn,look out.So, at TED,we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness.In fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it "radical openness,"because it works for us each time.We opened up our talks to the world,and suddenly there are millions of people out therehelping spread our speakers' ideas,and thereby making it easier for usto recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers.By opening up our translation program,thousands of heroic volunteers --some of them watching online right now, and thank you! --have translated our talksinto more than 70 languages,thereby tripling our viewership in non-English-speaking countries.By giving away our TEDx brand,we suddenly have a thousand-pluslive experiments in the art of spreading ideas.And these organizers,they're seeing each other, they're learning from each other.We are learning from them.We're getting great talks back from them.The wheel is turning.Okay, step back a minute.I mean, it's really not news for me to tell youthat innovation emerges out of groups.You know, we've heard that this week --this romantic notion of the lone geniuswith the "eureka!" moment that changes the worldis misleading.Even he said that, and he would know.We're a social species.We spark off each other.It's also not newsto say that the Internet has accelerated innovation.For the past 15 years,powerful communities have been connecting online,sparking off each other.If you take programmers,you know, the whole open-source movementis a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation.But what's key here is,the reason these groups have been able to connectis because their work output is of the typethat can be easily shared digitally --a picture, a music file,software.And that's why what I'm excited about,and what I think is under-reported,is the significance of the riseof online video.This is the technologythat's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally,thereby launching a whole new cycleof crowd-accelerated innovation.The first few years of the webwere pretty much video-free,for this reason: video files are huge; the web couldn't handle them.But in the last 10 years,bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold.Suddenly, here we are.Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day.Cisco actually estimates that, within four years,more than 90 percent of the web's data will be video.If it's all puppies, porn and piracy,we're doomed.I don't think it will be.Video is high-bandwidth for a reason.It packs a huge amount of data,and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it.Here, let me introduce you to Sam Haber.He's a unicyclist.Before YouTube,there was no way for him to discoverhis sport's true potential,because you can't communicate this stuff in words, right?But looking at video clips posted by strangers,a world of possibility opens up for him.Suddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate.And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online,inspire each other to greatness.And there are thousands of other examples of this happening --of video-driven evolution of skills,ranging from the physical to the artful.And I have to tell you,as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines,I find this strangely beautiful.I mean, there's a lot of passion right here on this screen.But if Rube Goldberg machinesand video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea,how about this.Jove is a websitethat was founded to encourage scientiststo publish their peer-reviewed researchon video.There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper.It can take months for a scientist in another labto figure out how to replicate the experimentsthat are described in print.Here's one such frustrated scientist,Moshe Pritsker, the founder of Jove.He told me that the world is wastingbillions of dollars on this.But look at this video.I mean, look: if you can showinstead of just describing,that problem goes away.So it's not far-fetched to saythat, at some point,online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance.Here's another examplethat's close to our hearts at TED,where video is sometimes more powerful than print --the sharing of an idea.Why do people like watching TEDTalks?All those ideas are already out there in print.It's actually faster to read than to view.Why would someone bother?Well, so, there's some showing as well as telling.But even leaving the screen out of it,there's still a lot more being transferred than just words.And in that non-verbal portion, there's some serious magic.Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures,the vocal cadence, the facial expressions,the eye contact,the passion,the kind of awkward, British body language,the sense of how the audience are reacting,there are hundreds of subconscious cluesthat go to how well you will understand,and whether you're inspired --light, if you like,and desire.Incredibly, all of this can be communicatedon just a few square inches of a screen.Reading and writing are actuallyrelatively recent inventions.Face-to-face communication has been fine-tunedby millions of years of evolution.That's what's made it into this mysterious, powerful thing it is.Someone speaks,there's resonance in all these receiving brains,the whole group acts together.I mean, this is the connective tissueof the human superorganism in action.It's probably driven our culture for millennia.500 years ago, it ran intoa competitor with a lethal advantage.It's right here.Print scaled.The world's ambitious innovators and influencersnow could get their ideas to spread far and wide,and so the art of the spoken wordpretty much withered on the vine.But now, in the blink of an eye,the game has changed again.It's not too much to saythat what Gutenberg did for writing,online video can now do for face-to-face communication.So, that primal medium,which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...that just went global.Now, this is big.We may have to reinvent an ancient art form.I mean, today, one person speakingcan be seen by millions,shedding bright light on potent ideas,creating intense desirefor learning and to respond --and in his case, intense desire to laugh.For the first time in human history,talented studentsdon't have to have their potential and their dreamswritten out of history by lousy teachers.They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest.Now, TED is just a small part of this.I mean, the world's universities are opening up their curricula.Thousands of individuals and organizationsare sharing their knowledge and data online.Thousands of people are figuring out new waysto learn and, crucially,to respond, completing the cycle.And so, as we've thought about this,you know, it's become clear to uswhat the next stage of TED's evolution has to be.TEDTalks can't be a one-way process, one-to-many.Our future is many-to-many.So, we're dreaming of waysto make it easier for you, the global TED community,to respond to speakers,to contribute your own ideas,maybe even your own TEDTalks,and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there.Because, if we can bubble up the very bestfrom a vastly larger pool,this wheel turns.Now, is it possible to imaginea similar process to this,happening to global education overall?I mean, does it have to be this painful,top-down process?Why not a self-fueling cyclein which we all can participate?It's the participation age, right?Schools can't be silos.We can't stop learning at age 21.What if, in the coming crowd of nine billion ...what if that crowd could learn enoughto be net contributors,instead of net plunderers?That changes everything, right?I mean, that would take more teachers than we've ever had.But the good news is they are out there.They're in the crowd,and the crowd is switching on lights,and we can see them for the first time,not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers,but as individuals we can learn from.Who's the teacher?You're the teacher.You're part of the crowdthat may be about to launchthe biggest learning cycle in human history,a cycle capable of carrying all of usto a smarter, wiser, more beautiful place.Here's a group of kids in a village in Pakistannear where I grew up.Within five years, each of these kids is going to have accessto a cellphone capable of full-on web videoand capable of uploading video to the web.I mean, is it crazy to think that this girl,in the back, at the right, in 15 years,might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautifulfor your grandchildren?It's not crazy; it's actually happening right now.I want to introduce you to a good friend of TEDwho just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown.(Video) Christopher Makau: Hi. My name is Christopher Makau.I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera.There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera.There's a self-help group.They turned a trash place into a garden.The same spot, it was a crime spotwhere people were being robbed.They used the same trashto form green manure.The same trash siteis feeding more than 30 families.We have our own film school.They are using Flip camerasto record, edit,and reporting to their own channel,Kibera TV.Because of a scarcity of land,we are using the sacks to grow vegetables,and also [we're] able to save on the cost of living.Change happens when we see things in a different way.Today, I see Kibera in a different way.My message to TEDGlobaland the entire world is:Kibera is a hotbedof innovation and ideas.(Applause)CA: You know what?I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy.What's new -- and it's huge --is that, for the first time, we get to see him,and he can see us.Right now, Chris and Kevinand Dennis and Dickson and their friendsare watching us, in Nairobi, right now.Guys,we've learned from you today.Thank you.And thank you.(Applause)



dan_cobley_what_physics_taught_me_about_marketing
1305240

So I work in marketing, which I love,but my first passion was physics,a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher,when I had a little less gray hair.So he taught methat physics is coolbecause it teaches us so much about the world around us.And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince youthat physics can teach us something about marketing.So quick show of hands --who studied some marketing in university?Who studied some physics in university?Pretty good. And at school?Okay, lots of you.So, hopefully this will bring back some happy,or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.So, physics and marketing.We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law:"The force equals mass times acceleration."This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlinesshould have studied a bit more carefullybefore they ran this campaign.(Laughter)But if we rearrange this formula quickly,we can get to acceleration equals force over mass,which meansthat for a larger particle -- a larger mass --it requires more force to change its direction.It's the same with brands:the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has,the more force is needed to change its positioning.And that's one of the reasons whyArthur Andersen chose to launch Accenturerather than try to persuade the worldthat Andersen's could stand for somethingother than accountancy.It explains why Hooverfound it very difficult to persuade the worldthat it was more than vacuum cleaners,and why companies like Unilever and P&amp;Gkeep brands separate,like Ariel and Pringles and Doverather than having one giant parent brand.So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an objectthe more force is neededto change its direction.The marketing is, the bigger a brand,the more difficult it is to reposition it.So think about a portfolio of brandsor maybe new brands for new ventures.Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?Getting a little more technical now.So this says thatit's impossible, by definition,to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position --and the momentum of a particle,because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particleand you shine a light on it,then the photon of light has momentum,which knocks the particle,so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.By measuring it,the act of measurement changes it.The act of observation changes it.It's the same in marketing.So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.Think about the group of momswho are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group,and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets,who stuff their trolleysfull of fresh green vegetables and fruit,but don't shop like that any other day.And if you think about the number of peoplewho claim in surveysto regularly look for porn on the Web,it's very few.Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.So luckily, the science --no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking,more digital media consumption,you can measure more what consumers actually do,rather than what they say they do.So the physics isyou can never accurately and exactlymeasure a particle,because the observation changes it.The marketing is -- the message for marketing is --that try to measure what consumers actually do,rather than what they say they'll door anticipate they'll do.So next, the scientific method --an axiom of physics, of all science --says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation,you can only disprove it.What this means is you can gather more and more dataaround a hypothesis or a positioning,and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.And only one contrary data pointcan blow your theory out of the water.So if we take an example --Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theorythat the planets would rotate around the Earth.It only took one robust observation from Copernicusto blow that idea out of the water.And there are parallels for marketing --you can invest for a long time in a brand,but a single contrary observation of that positioningwill destroy consumers' belief.Take BP --they spent millions of pounds over many yearsbuilding up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand,but then one little accident.Think about Toyota.It was, for a long time, reveredas the most reliable of cars,and then they had the big recall incident.And Tiger Woods, for a long time,the perfect brand ambassador.Well, you know the story.(Laughter)So the physics isthat you cannot prove a hypothesis,but it's easy to disprove it --any hypothesis is shaky.And the marketing isthat not matter how much you've invested in your brand,one bad week can undermine decades of good work.So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-upsthat can undermine your brand.And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy --the second law of thermodynamics.This says that entropy,which is a measure of the disorder of a system,will always increase.The same is true of marketing.If we go back 20 years,the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing managercould pretty much define a brand.But where we are today, things have changed.You can get a strong brand imageor a messageand put it out there like the Conservative Party didearlier this year with their election poster.But then you lose control of it.With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution toolsthat are available now to every consumer,it's impossible to control where it goes.Your brand starts being dispersed,(Laughter)it gets more chaotic.(Laughter)It's out of your control.(Laughter)I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.But while this may be unsettling for marketers,it's actually a good thing.This distribution of brand energygets your brand closer to the people,more in with the people.It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force,which is ultimately good for your brand.So, the lesson from physics isthat entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.You can't fight it, so embrace itand find a way to work with it.So to close,my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told methat physics is cool,and hopefully, I've convinced youthat physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.Thank you.(Applause)



seth_priebatsch_the_game_layer_on_top_of_the_world

I'm a proud Princeton dropout.where I actually grew up.(Applause) Yeah, Boston.a game layer on top of the world.but that's not quite true,And it looks like this right now.It's not very good. It's cluttered.coupon cards and all these loyalty schemesthey just suck.They're not very well-designed.(Laughter)So that's unfortunate.are game dynamics themselves.four really important game dynamics,you can use to influence behavior,both for good, for bad, for in-between.Hopefully for good.Why is this important?I'm making this claimhas been this framework for connections,There's still a lot to explore,but the framework itself is done,and it's called Facebook.I like it quite a lot.and they own all of our connections.They own half a billion people.And if you're happy with that, fantastic.And that's a real thing.and makes it productive down the road.The game layer is all about influence.and connecting you to other peopleeverywhere you are and everywhere you go,how you do it.That's really, really powerful.while it's just getting constructed,that we think about it very consciously,and can be leveraged for good.because construction has just begun,is not with glass and steel and cement.that we have.The resources are mindshare,Back at SCVNGR, we like to jokeToday, I'm going to show you four,(Laughter)It's called the appointment dynamic.It's a dynamic in which to succeed,generally at a predefined place.that will manipulate how I interact:what I do, where I do it, when I do it."can be frightening.so you can rationalize it a bit;I think everything is a game,or on a computer screen;and one of how it can be used for good,is something called, "Happy Hour."get your drinks half off.This game dynamic is so powerful,That's a really scary thought,If you haven't, I recommend playing it.It's incredibly powerful,to water your fake crops, or they wilt.when they say your crops wiltthey could make it a 30-minute cycle,and no one could do anything else, right?(Laughter)That's a little scary.But this could also be used for good.This local company called VitalityThat's an appointment.You should get points for doing it on timeand lose points for not doing it on time.and leverage the games.We're going to jump onto the next one.Influence and status.It's used in your wallets, right now.And you see someone at CVS or --not CVS -- like, Christian Dior --(Laughter)(Laughter)and I need that."And this is used in games as well.because they've got that cool red badge,And that's very powerful to me.Status is really good motivator.and can be used more consciously there.(Laughter)(Applause)So school is a game,But let's use it consciously.That sucks. Why not level-up?and you level up from B to an A.And it's very powerful.It can be used in interesting ways.in a very granular fashion.where I am an unwhole individual.I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn,and that bothers me.And this is so deep-seated in our psycheWe will find a way to move that blue lineI mean, this is a Paladin level 10,and that's a Paladin level 20.against the Ra's Al Ghul,I would.And so people work very hard to level-up.One of the things we work on at SCVNGR is:And here, we have a game that people play.engaging with the business,and unlock rewards.creates loyalty, creates engagement,is this concept of communal discovery,Communal discovery is powerfulto solve problems.which I'm sure you've all heard of.Digg is a communal dynamicAnd they made this into a game, initially.you would get points.recommending people's stories.So we have to use this one carefully.This is the DARPA balloon challenge,and the winner will get $40,000."The winner was a group out of MIT,all across the country.Really powerful dynamic.And so, I've got about 20 seconds left,last decade was the decade of social.This next decade is the decade of games.We can influence behavior.It's very powerful. It's very exciting.(Applause)



jason_clay_how_big_brands_can_save_biodiversity

I grew up on a small farm in Missouri.We lived on less than a dollar a dayfor about 15 years.I got a scholarship, went to university,studied international agriculture, studied anthropology,and decided I was going to give back.I was going to work with small farmers.I was going to help alleviate poverty.I was going to work on international development,and then I took a turnand ended up here.Now, if you get a Ph.D., and you decide not to teach,you don't always end up in a place like this.It's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab.You could be in New York.What I found was,I started working with refugees and famine victims --small farmers, all, or nearly all --who had been dispossessed and displaced.Now, what I'd been trained to dowas methodological research on such people.So I did it: I found out how many womenhad been raped en route to these camps.I found out how many people had been put in jail,how many family members had been killed.I assessed how long they were going to stayand how much it would take to feed them.And I got really good at predictinghow many body bags you would needfor the people who were going to die in these camps.Now this is God's work, but it's not my work.It's not the work I set out to do.So I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforestsin 1988.I met a guy -- the guy on the left.His name was Ben.He said, "What can I do to save the rainforests?"I said, "Well, Ben, what do you do?""I make ice cream."So I said, "Well, you've got to makea rainforest ice cream.And you've got to use nuts from the rainforeststo show that forests are worth more as foreststhan they are as pasture."He said, "Okay."Within a year,Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves.It was a great success.We did our first million-dollars-worth of tradeby buying on 30 days and selling on 21.That gets your adrenaline going.Then we had a four and a half million-dollar line of creditbecause we were credit-worthy at that point.We had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percentof the global Brazil-nut market.We paid two to three times more than anybody else.Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nutsbecause we would buy it otherwise.A great success.50 companies signed up, 200 products came out,generated 100 million in sales.It failed.Why did it fail?Because the people who were gathering Brazil nutsweren't the same people who were cutting the forests.And the people who made money from Brazil nutswere not the people who made money from cutting the forests.We were attacking the wrong driver.We needed to be working on beef.We needed to be working on lumber.We needed to be working on soy --things that we were not focused on.So let's go back to Sudan.I often talk to refugees:"Why was it that the West didn't realizethat famines are caused by policies and politics,not by weather?"And this farmer said to me, one day,something that was very profound.He said, "You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep."(Laughter)Okay. Fast forward.We live on a planet.There's just one of them.We've got to wake up to the factthat we don't have any moreand that this is a finite planet.We know the limits of the resources we have.We may be able to use them differently.We may have some innovative, new ideas.But in general, this is what we've got.There's no more of it.There's a basic equation that we can't get away from.Population times consumptionhas got to have some kind of relationship to the planet,and right now, it's a simple "not equal."Our work shows that we're livingat about 1.3 planets.Since 1990,we crossed the lineof being in a sustainable relationship to the planet.Now we're at 1.3.If we were farmers, we'd be eating our seed.For bankers, we'd be living off the principal, not the interest.This is where we stand today.A lot of people like to pointto some place else as the cause of the problem.It's always population growth.Population growth's important,but it's also about how much each person consumes.So when the average Americanconsumes 43 times as muchas the average African,we've got to think that consumption is an issue.It's not just about population,and it's not just about them; it's about us.But it's not just about people;it's about lifestyles.There's very good evidence --again, we don't necessarily havea peer-reviewed methodologythat's bulletproof yet --but there's very good evidencethat the average cat in Europehas a larger environmental footprint in its lifetimethan the average African.You think that's not an issue going forward?You think that's not a questionas to how we should be using the Earth's resources?Let's go back and visit our equation.In 2000, we had six billion people on the planet.They were consuming what they were consuming --let's say one unit of consumption each.We have six billion units of consumption.By 2050,we're going to have nine billion people -- all the scientists agree.They're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do --scientists, again, agree --because income is going to grow in developing countriesfive times what it is today --on global average, about [2.9].So we're going to have 18 billion units of consumption.Who have you heard talking latelythat's said we have to triple productionof goods and services?But that's what the math says.We're not going to be able to do that.We can get productivity up.We can get efficiency up.But we've also got to get consumption down.We need to use lessto make more.And then we need to use less again.And then we need to consume less.All of those things are part of that equation.But it basically raises a fundamental question:should consumers have a choiceabout sustainability, about sustainable products?Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainablesitting next to one that isn't,or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable?If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet,how do you make that happen?The average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S.Okay, so let's be generous.Let's say it's 3.5 seconds in Europe.How do you evaluate all the scientific dataaround a product,the data that's changing on a weekly, if not a daily, basis?How do you get informed?You don't.Here's a little question.From a greenhouse gas perspective,is lamb produced in the U.K.better than lamb produced in New Zealand,frozen and shipped to the U.K.?Is a bad feeder lot operation for beefbetter or worse thana bad grazing operation for beef?Do organic potatoesactually have fewer toxic chemicalsused to produce themthan conventional potatoes?In every single case,the answer is "it depends."It depends on who produced it and how,in every single instance.And there are many others.How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield?They're not.They may have a lot of opinions about it,but they're not going to be terribly informed.Sustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue.It's got to be something we all care about.And we need collusion.We need groups to work together that never have.We need Cargill to work with Bunge.We need Coke to work with Pepsi.We need Oxford to work with Cambridge.We need Greenpeace to work with WWF.Everybody's got to work together --China and the U.S.We need to begin to manage this planetas if our life depended on it,because it does,it fundamentally does.But we can't do everything.Even if we get everybody working on it,we've got to be strategic.We need to focus on the where,the what and the who.So, the where:We've identified 35 places globally that we need to work.These are the places that are the richest in biodiversityand the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view.We have to work in these places.We have to save these places if we want a chance in hellof preserving biodiversity as we know it.We looked at the threats to these places.These are the 15 commoditiesthat fundamentally pose the biggest threatsto these placesbecause of deforestation,soil loss, water use, pesticide use,over-fishing, etc.So we've got 35 places,we've got 15 priority commodities,who do we work withto change the way those commodities are produced?Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers?Let's see, that's about 7,000 languages,350 major languages --a lot of work there.I don't see anybody actually being ableto do that very effectively.Are we going to work with 1.5 billion producers?Again, a daunting task.There must be a better way.300 to 500 companiescontrol 70 percent or moreof the trade of each of the 15 commoditiesthat we've identified as the most significant.If we work with those, if we change those companiesand the way they do business,then the rest will happen automatically.So, we went through our 15 commodities.This is nine of them.We lined them up side-by-side,and we put the names of the companies that workon each of those.And if you go through the first 25 or 30 namesof each of the commodities,what you begin to see is,gosh, there's Cargill here, there's Cargill there,there's Cargill everywhere.In fact, these names start coming up over and over again.So we did the analysis again a slightly different way.We said: if we take the top hundred companies,what percentageof all 15 commoditiesdo they touch, buy or sell?And what we found is it's 25 percent.So 100 companiescontrol 25 percent of the tradeof all 15 of the most significantcommodities on the planet.We can get our arms around a hundred companies.A hundred companies, we can work with.Why is 25 percent important?Because if these companies demand sustainable products,they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production.Companies can push producersfaster than consumers can.By companies asking for this,we can leverage production so much fasterthan by waiting for consumers to do it.After 40 years, the global organic movementhas achieved 0.7 of one percentof global food.We can't wait that long.We don't have that kind of time.We need changethat's going to accelerate.Even working with individual companiesis not probably going to get us there.We need to begin to work with industries.So we've started roundtableswhere we bring together the entire value chain,from producersall the way to the retailers and brands.We bring in civil society, we bring in NGOs,we bring in researchers and scientiststo have an informed discussion --sometimes a battle royale --to figure out what are the key impactsof these products,what is a global benchmark,what's an acceptable impact,and design standards around that.It's not all fun and games.In salmon aquaculture,we kicked off a roundtablealmost six years ago.Eight entities came to the table.We eventually got, I think, 60 percentof global production at the tableand 25 percent of demand at the table.Three of the original eight entities were suing each other.And yet, next week, we launchglobally verified, vetted and certifiedstandards for salmon aquaculture.It can happen.(Applause)So what bringsthe different entities to the table?It's risk and demand.For the big companies, it's reputational risk,but more importantly,they don't care what the price of commodities is.If they don't have commodities, they don't have a business.They care about availability,so the big risk for them is not having product at all.For the producers,if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way,that's what brings them to the table.So it's the demand that brings them to the table.The good news iswe identified a hundred companies two years ago.In the last 18 months, we've signed agreementswith 40 of those hundred companiesto begin to work with them on their supply chain.And in the next 18 months,we will have signed up to work with another 40,and we think we'll get those signed as well.Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOsof these 80 companies togetherto help twist the arms of the final 20,to bring them to the table,because they don't like NGOs, they've never worked with NGOs,they're concerned about this, they're concerned about that,but we all need to be in this together.So we're pulling out all the stops.We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table.One company we're working with that's begun --in baby steps, perhaps --but has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill.They've funded research that showsthat we can double global palm oil productionwithout cutting a single tree in the next 20 years,and do it all in Borneo aloneby planting on land that's already degraded.The study shows that the highest net present valuefor palm oilis on land that's been degraded.They're also undertaking a study to look atall of their supplies of palm oilto see if they could be certifiedand what they would need to change in order to become third-party certifiedunder a credible certification program.Why is Cargill important?Because Cargill has 20 to 25 percentof global palm oil.If Cargill makes a decision,the entire palm oil industry moves,or at least 40 or 50 percent of it.That's not insignificant.More importantly, Cargill and one other companyship 50 percent of the palm oilthat goes to China.We don't have to change the waya single Chinese company worksif we get Cargill to only sendsustainable palm oil to China.It's a pre-competitive issue.All the palm oil going there is good.Buy it.Mars is also on a similar journey.Now most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company,but Mars has made sustainability pledgesto buy only certified product for all of its seafood.It turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmartbecause of pet food.But they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate,and it all comes from the factthat Mars wants to be in business in the future.And what they see is that they need toimprove chocolate production.On any given plantation,20 percent of the trees produce 80 percent of the crop,so Mars is looking at the genome,they're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant.They're doing it with IBM and the USDA,and they're putting it in the public domainbecause they want everybody to have access to this data,because they want everybody to help themmake cocoa more productive and more sustainable.What they've realizedis that if they can identify the traitson productivity and drought tolerance,they can produce 320 percent as much cocoaon 40 percent of the land.The rest of the land can be used for something else.It's more with less and less again.That's what the future has got to be,and putting it in the public domain is smart.They don't want to be an I.P. company; they want to be a chocolate company,but they want to be a chocolate company forever.Now, the price of food, many people complain about,but in fact, the price of food is going down,and that's odd because in fact,consumers are not paying for the true cost of food.If you take a look just at water,what we see is that,with four very common products,you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products,and then you look at how much water input was put into them,and then you look at what the farmer was paid.If you divide the amount of waterinto what the farmer was paid,the farmer didn't receive enough moneyto pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities.That is an externality by definition.This is the subsidy from nature.Coca-Cola, they've worked a lot on water,but right now, they're entering into 17-year contractswith growers in Turkeyto sell juice into Europe,and they're doing that because they want to have a productthat's closer to the European market.But they're not just buying the juice;they're also buying the carbon in the treesto offset the shipment costs associated with carbonto get the product into Europe.There's carbon that's being bought with sugar,with coffee, with beef.This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalitiesback into the price of the commodity.We need to take what we've learned in private, voluntary standardsof what the best producers in the world are doingand use that to inform government regulation,so we can shift the entire performance curve.We can't just focus on identifying the best;we've got to move the rest.The issue isn't what to think, it's how to think.These companies have begun to think differently.They're on a journey; there's no turning back.We're all on that same journey with them.We have to really begin to changethe way we think about everything.Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billionis not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine.Thank you.(Applause)

I want to start my talk today with two observationsabout the human species.The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious,and that's that our species, Homo sapiens,is actually really, really smart --like, ridiculously smart --like you're all doing thingsthat no other species on the planet does right now.And this is, of course,not the first time you've probably recognized this.Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sagefrom Shakespeare to Stephen Colbertto point out things like the fact thatwe're noble in reason and infinite in facultiesand just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planetwhen it comes to all things cerebral.But of course, there's a second observation about the human speciesthat I want to focus on a little bit more,and that's the fact thateven though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart,we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumbwhen it comes to some aspects of our decision making.Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular outon any aspects of your own mistakes.But of course, just in the last two yearswe see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.And we've watched as the tools we uniquely maketo pull the resources out of our environmentkind of just blow up in our face.We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create --these markets that were supposed to be foolproof --we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.But both of these two embarrassing examples, I think,don't highlight what I think is most embarrassingabout the mistakes that humans make,which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we makeare really just the result of a couple bad applesor a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learningis that most of us, when put in certain contexts,will actually make very specific mistakes.The errors we make are actually predictable.We make them again and again.And they're actually immune to lots of evidence.When we get negative feedback,we still, the next time we're face with a certain context,tend to make the same errors.And so this has been a real puzzle to meas a sort of scholar of human nature.What I'm most curious about is,how is a species that's as smart as we arecapable of such badand such consistent errors all the time?You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.Because we're a smart species,we can actually create all kinds of environmentsthat are super, super complicated,sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand,even though we've actually created them.We create financial markets that are super complex.We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.And of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it,in some sense makes sense that we actuallymight mess certain things up.If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solutionto the problem of human error.We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure outthe kinds of technologies we can't deal with,the kinds of environments that are bad --get rid of those, design things better,and we should be the noble speciesthat we expect ourselves to be.But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying,which is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.This is a hint that I've gottenfrom watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.And what we see is that people tend to keep making errorsexactly the same way, over and over again.It feels like we might almost just be builtto make errors in certain ways.This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about,because, if it's us that's messed up,it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.We might just have to accept the fact that we're error proneand try to design things around it.So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?What we need is a populationthat's basically smart, can make lots of decisions,but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have,any of the things that might mess us up --no human technology, human culture,maybe even not human language.And so this is why we turned to these guys here.These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.These guys are New World primates,which means they broke off from the human branchabout 35 million years ago.This means that your great, great, great great, great, great --with about five million "greats" in there --grandmother was probably the same great, great, great, greatgrandmother with five million "greats" in thereas Holly up here.You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant,but albeit evolutionary, relative.The good news about Holly though is thatshe doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.You know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well,but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.So she's the perfect test case.What if we put Holly into the same context as humans?Does she make the same mistakes as us?Does she not learn from them? And so on.And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly,see if she messes these things up.First problem is just, well, where should we start?Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.You know, where are we actually going to start with this?And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse,around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news,we said, hhmm, maybe we shouldactually start in the financial domain.Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisionsand try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.Of course, that's when we hit a sort second problem --a little bit more methodological --which is that, maybe you guys don't know,but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind youat the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.How are we actually going to ask monkeys about moneyif they don't actually use it?So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it upand teach monkeys how to use money.So that's just what we did.What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know ofof non-human currency.We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies,so we just called it a token.But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yaleto actually use with humans,to actually buy different pieces of food.It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much.Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know,once you get home, it's actually pretty useless.It was useless to the monkeys at firstbefore they realized what they could do with it.When we first gave it to them in their enclosures,they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.They were these kind of weird things.But very quickly, the monkeys realizedthat they could actually hand these tokens overto different humans in the lab for some food.And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bitcurious about these things -- doesn't know.There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter,and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.Hands it over, and then gets some food.It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get goodat trading tokens with human salesman.So here's just a quick video of what this looks like.Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some foodand waiting happily and getting her food.Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.So the monkeys get really good at this.They're surprisingly good at this with very little training.We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.The question is: is this anything like human money?Is this a market at all,or did we just do a weird psychologist's trickby getting monkeys to do something,looking smart, but not really being smart.And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously doif this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?Well, you might actually imagine themto do all the kinds of smart thingsthat humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.You might have them start paying attention to price,paying attention to how much they buy --sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.Do the monkeys do anything like this?And so our monkey marketplace was born.The way this works is thatour monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.When they get a hankering for some treats,we actually allowed them a way outinto a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.Upon entering the market --it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human marketsbecause, as the monkeys entered the door of the market,a human would give them a big wallet full of tokensso they could actually trade the tokenswith one of these two guys here --two different possible human salesmenthat they could actually buy stuff from.The salesmen were students from my lab.They dressed differently; they were different people.And over time, they did basically the same thingso the monkeys could learn, you know,who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.And you can see that each of the experimentersis actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.and that's what the monkey can for a single token.So everything costs one token,but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others,sometimes more grapes than others.So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.But here's Honey.She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.You can see Honey, very good market economist,goes with the guy who gives more.She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.So not just Honey,most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.They really cared about their monkey token dollar.The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economiststo actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools,they basically matched, not just qualitatively,but quantitatively with what we sawhumans doing in a real market.So much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers,you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.And what we'd really thought we'd doneis like we'd actually introduced somethingthat, at least for the monkeys and us,works like a real financial currency.Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplacewas any evidence of saving --you know, just like our own species.The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budgetand then went back to everyone else.The other thing we also spontaneously saw,embarrassingly enough,is spontaneous evidence of larceny.The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity --from each other, often from us --you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing,but things we spontaneously saw.So we said, this looks bad.Can we actually see if the monkeysare doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?One possibility is just kind of letthe monkey financial system play out,you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.We were a little impatient so we wantedto sort of speed things up a bit.So we said, let's actually give the monkeysthe same kinds of problemsthat humans tend to get wrongin certain kinds of economic challenges,or certain kinds of economic experiments.And so, since the best way to see how people go wrongis to actually do it yourself,I'm going to give you guys a quick experimentto sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.So imagine that right nowI handed each and every one of youa thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.Take these, put it in your walletand spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.Donate it, take it, and so on.Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.And here's your choice: you can either be risky,in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.If it comes up tails, you get nothing.So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.I'm just going to give you 500 bucks.You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.So see what your intuition is here.Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.You might say, eh, that's not really irrational.People are a little risk-averse. So what?Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinkingabout the same problemset up just a little bit differently.So now imagine that I give each and every one of you2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.And now imagine that I have you make another choiceBut this time, it's a little bit worse.Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money,but you're going to get the same choice.You can either take a risky loss --so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing --or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your walletand give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.So maybe you're having the same intuitionsas the subjects that were actually tested in this,which is when presented with these options,people don't choose to play it safe.They actually tend to go a little risky.The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situationsthe same choice.It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000,or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.But people's intuitions about how much risk to takevaries depending on where they started with.So what's going on?Well, it turns out that this seems to be the resultof at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.You really have to do work to figure out,well, one option's a thousand, 2,000;one is 1,500.Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative termsas options change from one time to another.So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."This is all well and good, except thatchanges in different directionsactually effect whether or not we thinkoptions are good or not.And this leads to the second bias,which economists have called loss aversion.The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.And this means that sometimes we'll actuallyswitch our preferences to avoid this.What you saw in that last scenario is thatsubjects get riskybecause they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.That means when we're in a risk mindset --excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset,we actually become more risky,which can actually be really worrying.These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer --because they're evaluating them in relative terms.They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house --because they don't want to sell at a loss.The question we were interested inis whether the monkeys show the same biases.If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market,would they do the same thing as people?And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choicesbetween guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time --or guys who were risky --they did things differently half the time.And then we gave them options that were bonuses --like you guys did in the first scenario --so they actually have a chance more,or pieces where they were experiencing losses --they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.And so this is what this looks like.We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape,so it looks pretty good.But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.The guy on the left is a safe bonus.All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero.Sometimes the monkeys get two extra.For a big bonus, now they get three.But this is the same choice you guys just faced.Do the monkeys actually want to play it safeand then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial,or do they want to be riskyand try to get a risky, but big, bonus,but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.People here played it safe.Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.Qualitatively and quantitatively,they choose exactly the same way as people,when tested in the same thing.You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.Maybe we should see how they do with losses.And so we ran a second version of this.Now, the monkeys meet two guyswho aren't giving them bonuses;they're actually giving them less than they expect.So they look like they're starting out with a big amount.These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.They guy on the left is a safe loss.Every single time, he's going to take one of these awayand give the monkeys just two.the guy on the right is the risky loss.Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched,but sometimes he actually gives a big loss,taking away two to give the monkeys only one.And so what do the monkeys do?Again, same choice; they can play it safefor always getting two grapes every single time,or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice,they do the same irrational thing that people do.They actually become more riskydepending on how the experimenters started.This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys tooare evaluating things in relative termsand actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.So what does all of this mean?Well, what we've shown is that, first of all,we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency,and they do very similar things with it.They do some of the smart things we do,some of the kind of not so nice things we do,like steal it and so on.But they also do some of the irrational things we do.They systematically get things wrongand in the same ways that we do.This is the first take-home message of the Talk,which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought,oh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.They're way cuter than the one at ... you know --Don't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumbas the human one you already have.So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.A little bad for monkey investors.But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.Because we've answered the question we started out with.We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.And we started with the hope that maybe we cansort of tweak our financial institutions,tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.In fact, they might be due to the very natureof our evolutionary history.You know, maybe it's not just humansat the right side of this chain that's duncey.Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results,means that these duncey strategiesmight be 35 million years old.That's a long time for a strategyto potentially get changed around -- really, really old.What do we know about other old strategies like this?Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.You know, think of our evolutionary predilectionfor eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.You can't just shut that off.You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."We're just built differently.We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.My guess is that the same thing is going to be truewhen humans are perceivingdifferent financial decisions.When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red,when you're watching your house price go down,you're not going to be able to see thatin anything but old evolutionary terms.This means that the biasesthat lead investors to do badly,that lead to the foreclosure crisisare going to be really hard to overcome.So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.Well, the good news, I think,is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk,which is that humans are not only smart;we're really inspirationally smartto the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations --you know, I flew over here in an airplane.I didn't have to try to flap my wings.I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.We actually have all of these caseswhere we overcome our biological limitationsthrough technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.But we have to recognize that we have those limitations.And here's the rub.It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only specieswho refuses to be what he really is."But the irony is thatit might only be in recognizing our limitationsthat we can really actually overcome them.The hope is that you all will think about your limitations,not necessarily as unovercomable,but to recognize them, accept themand then use the world of design to actually figure them out.That might be the only way that we will really be ableto achieve our own human potentialand really be the noble species we hope to all be.Thank you.(Applause)

I want to start my talk today with two observationsabout the human species.The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious,and that's that our species, Homo sapiens,is actually really, really smart --like, ridiculously smart --like you're all doing thingsthat no other species on the planet does right now.And this is, of course,not the first time you've probably recognized this.Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sagefrom Shakespeare to Stephen Colbertto point out things like the fact thatwe're noble in reason and infinite in facultiesand just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planetwhen it comes to all things cerebral.But of course, there's a second observation about the human speciesthat I want to focus on a little bit more,and that's the fact thateven though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart,we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumbwhen it comes to some aspects of our decision making.Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular outon any aspects of your own mistakes.But of course, just in the last two yearswe see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.And we've watched as the tools we uniquely maketo pull the resources out of our environmentkind of just blow up in our face.We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create --these markets that were supposed to be foolproof --we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.But both of these two embarrassing examples, I think,don't highlight what I think is most embarrassingabout the mistakes that humans make,which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we makeare really just the result of a couple bad applesor a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learningis that most of us, when put in certain contexts,will actually make very specific mistakes.The errors we make are actually predictable.We make them again and again.And they're actually immune to lots of evidence.When we get negative feedback,we still, the next time we're face with a certain context,tend to make the same errors.And so this has been a real puzzle to meas a sort of scholar of human nature.What I'm most curious about is,how is a species that's as smart as we arecapable of such badand such consistent errors all the time?You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.Because we're a smart species,we can actually create all kinds of environmentsthat are super, super complicated,sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand,even though we've actually created them.We create financial markets that are super complex.We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.And of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it,in some sense makes sense that we actuallymight mess certain things up.If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solutionto the problem of human error.We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure outthe kinds of technologies we can't deal with,the kinds of environments that are bad --get rid of those, design things better,and we should be the noble speciesthat we expect ourselves to be.But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying,which is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.This is a hint that I've gottenfrom watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.And what we see is that people tend to keep making errorsexactly the same way, over and over again.It feels like we might almost just be builtto make errors in certain ways.This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about,because, if it's us that's messed up,it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.We might just have to accept the fact that we're error proneand try to design things around it.So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?What we need is a populationthat's basically smart, can make lots of decisions,but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have,any of the things that might mess us up --no human technology, human culture,maybe even not human language.And so this is why we turned to these guys here.These are one of the guys I work with.

And so on.And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly,see if she messes these things up.First problem is just, well, where should we start?Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.You know, where are we actually going to start with this?And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse,around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news,we said, hhmm, maybe we shouldactually start in the financial domain.Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisionsand try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.Of course, that's when we hit a sort second problem --a little bit more methodological --which is that, maybe you guys don't know,but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind youat the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.How are we actually going to ask monkeys about moneyif they don't actually use it?So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it upand teach monkeys how to use money.So that's just what we did.What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know ofof non-human currency.We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies,so we just called it a token.But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yaleto actually use with humans,to actually buy different pieces of food.It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much.Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know,once you get home, it's actually pretty useless.It was useless to the monkeys at firstbefore they realized what they could do with it.When we first gave it to them in their enclosures,they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.They were these kind of weird things.But very quickly, the monkeys realizedthat they could actually hand these tokens overto different humans in the lab for some food.And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bitcurious about these things -- doesn't know.There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter,and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.Hands it over, and then gets some food.It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get goodat trading tokens with human salesman.So here's just a quick video of what this looks like.Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some foodand waiting happily and getting her food.Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.So the monkeys get really good at this.They're surprisingly good at this with very little training.We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.The question is: is this anything like human money?Is this a market at all,or did we just do a weird psychologist's trickby getting monkeys to do something,looking smart, but not really being smart.And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously doif this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?Well, you might actually imagine themto do all the kinds of smart thingsthat humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.You might have them start paying attention to price,paying attention to how much they buy --sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.Do the monkeys do anything like this?And so our monkey marketplace was born.The way this works is thatour monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.When they get a hankering for some treats,we actually allowed them a way outinto a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.Upon entering the market --it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human marketsbecause, as the monkeys entered the door of the market,a human would give them a big wallet full of tokensso they could actually trade the tokenswith one of these two guys here --two different possible human salesmenthat they could actually buy stuff from.The salesmen were students from my lab.They dressed differently; they were different people.And over time, they did basically the same thingso the monkeys could learn, you know,who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.And you can see that each of the experimentersis actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.and that's what the monkey can for a single token.So everything costs one token,but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others,sometimes more grapes than others.So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.But here's Honey.She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.You can see Honey, very good market economist,goes with the guy who gives more.She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.So not just Honey,most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.They really cared about their monkey token dollar.The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economiststo actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools,they basically matched, not just qualitatively,but quantitatively with what we sawhumans doing in a real market.So much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers,you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.And what we'd really thought we'd doneis like we'd actually introduced somethingthat, at least for the monkeys and us,works like a real financial currency.Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplacewas any evidence of saving --you know, just like our own species.The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budgetand then went back to everyone else.The other thing we also spontaneously saw,embarrassingly enough,is spontaneous evidence of larceny.The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity --from each other, often from us --you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing,but things we spontaneously saw.So we said, this looks bad.Can we actually see if the monkeysare doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?One possibility is just kind of letthe monkey financial system play out,you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.We were a little impatient so we wantedto sort of speed things up a bit.So we said, let's actually give the monkeysthe same kinds of problemsthat humans tend to get wrongin certain kinds of economic challenges,or certain kinds of economic experiments.And so, since the best way to see how people go wrongis to actually do it yourself,I'm going to give you guys a quick experimentto sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.So imagine that right nowI handed each and every one of youa thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.Take these, put it in your walletand spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.Donate it, take it, and so on.Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.And here's your choice: you can either be risky,in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.If it comes up tails, you get nothing.So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.I'm just going to give you 500 bucks.You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.So see what your intuition is here.Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.You might say, eh, that's not really irrational.People are a little risk-averse. So what?Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinkingabout the same problemset up just a little bit differently.So now imagine that I give each and every one of you2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.And now imagine that I have you make another choiceBut this time, it's a little bit worse.Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money,but you're going to get the same choice.You can either take a risky loss --so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing --or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your walletand give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.So maybe you're having the same intuitionsas the subjects that were actually tested in this,which is when presented with these options,people don't choose to play it safe.They actually tend to go a little risky.The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situationsthe same choice.It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000,or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.But people's intuitions about how much risk to takevaries depending on where they started with.So what's going on?Well, it turns out that this seems to be the resultof at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.You really have to do work to figure out,well, one option's a thousand, 2,000;one is 1,500.Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative termsas options change from one time to another.So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."This is all well and good, except thatchanges in different directionsactually effect whether or not we thinkoptions are good or not.And this leads to the second bias,which economists have called loss aversion.The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.And this means that sometimes we'll actuallyswitch our preferences to avoid this.What you saw in that last scenario is thatsubjects get riskybecause they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.That means when we're in a risk mindset --excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset,we actually become more risky,which can actually be really worrying.These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer --because they're evaluating them in relative terms.They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house --because they don't want to sell at a loss.The question we were interested inis whether the monkeys show the same biases.If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market,would they do the same thing as people?And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choicesbetween guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time --or guys who were risky --they did things differently half the time.And then we gave them options that were bonuses --like you guys did in the first scenario --so they actually have a chance more,or pieces where they were experiencing losses --they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.And so this is what this looks like.We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape,so it looks pretty good.But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.The guy on the left is a safe bonus.All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero.Sometimes the monkeys get two extra.For a big bonus, now they get three.But this is the same choice you guys just faced.Do the monkeys actually want to play it safeand then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial,or do they want to be riskyand try to get a risky, but big, bonus,but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.People here played it safe.Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.Qualitatively and quantitatively,they choose exactly the same way as people,when tested in the same thing.You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.Maybe we should see how they do with losses.And so we ran a second version of this.Now, the monkeys meet two guyswho aren't giving them bonuses;they're actually giving them less than they expect.So they look like they're starting out with a big amount.These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.They guy on the left is a safe loss.Every single time, he's going to take one of these awayand give the monkeys just two.the guy on the right is the risky loss.Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched,but sometimes he actually gives a big loss,taking away two to give the monkeys only one.And so what do the monkeys do?Again, same choice; they can play it safefor always getting two grapes every single time,or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice,they do the same irrational thing that people do.They actually become more riskydepending on how the experimenters started.This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys tooare evaluating things in relative termsand actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.So what does all of this mean?Well, what we've shown is that, first of all,we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency,and they do very similar things with it.They do some of the smart things we do,some of the kind of not so nice things we do,like steal it and so on.But they also do some of the irrational things we do.They systematically get things wrongand in the same ways that we do.This is the first take-home message of the Talk,which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought,oh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.They're way cuter than the one at ... you know --Don't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumbas the human one you already have.So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.A little bad for monkey investors.But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.Because we've answered the question we started out with.We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.And we started with the hope that maybe we cansort of tweak our financial institutions,tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.In fact, they might be due to the very natureof our evolutionary history.You know, maybe it's not just humansat the right side of this chain that's duncey.Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results,means that these duncey strategiesmight be 35 million years old.That's a long time for a strategyto potentially get changed around -- really, really old.What do we know about other old strategies like this?Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.You know, think of our evolutionary predilectionfor eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.You can't just shut that off.You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."We're just built differently.We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.My guess is that the same thing is going to be truewhen humans are perceivingdifferent financial decisions.When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red,when you're watching your house price go down,you're not going to be able to see thatin anything but old evolutionary terms.This means that the biasesthat lead investors to do badly,that lead to the foreclosure crisisare going to be really hard to overcome.So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.Well, the good news, I think,is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk,which is that humans are not only smart;we're really inspirationally smartto the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations --you know, I flew over here in an airplane.I didn't have to try to flap my wings.I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.We actually have all of these caseswhere we overcome our biological limitationsthrough technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.But we have to recognize that we have those limitations.And here's the rub.It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only specieswho refuses to be what he really is."But the irony is thatit might only be in recognizing our limitationsthat we can really actually overcome them.The hope is that you all will think about your limitations,not necessarily as unovercomable,but to recognize them, accept themand then use the world of design to actually figure them out.That might be the only way that we will really be ableto achieve our own human potentialand really be the noble species we hope to all be.Thank you.(Applause)

I am a marine toxicologist,and I've been very, very concerned about the Gulf,particularly about the massive applicationsof the toxic dispersants,the Corexits.I've been working on ocean pollutionfor quite a long time --the impacts on marine life and particularly the impactson marine mammals.As it turns out, marine mammalsare at the top of this food chainthat we're pouring millions of tonsof toxic substances intoevery year.And they are showing the signs of this.I'm sorry to have a sad slide like this,but not everything is all that happy,especially in my work.They are loadedwith toxic chemicals in their body,hundreds of compounds,all kinds of compounds -- it's staggering.And they're dying off rather regularly,tens of thousands around the world.It's predicted they may go extinct --about a third of them --within about 30 years.So my project is along the Northwest Atlantic.It's called Seals as Sentinels.We're tracking pollutionat the top of the food web, in marine mammals and fish.It's a region-wide,eco-toxicological investigation.We're looking at a lot of compounds,but recently been quite interested inthe flame retardants, the brominated flame retardantsthat are in many, many thingsthat we use in our everyday life,from the cushions in the chairswe're all sitting onto the plastic casings of our computers,our television sets and so on.So we are trackinghow do these things get fromthe products into the ocean,which is the final sink for them.And there's quite a complicated pathway for thatbecause, as these products age,they get concentrated in dust,and then they also get thrown out, so they go to the landfills.They wind up in waste water treatment plants.As you all know, we throw out billionsof computers and TVs every year.And those go to e-waste dumps.And all that gets into surface waters,eventually reaching the ocean, the final sink.So, in our study,we did find quite high levels, as we expected,of these flame retardants in the harbor seals' bodies.And we reported this.It led to a ban of this neuro-toxic flame retardantcalled Deca in Maine, where I am based,and also then a phase-out,U.S.-wide, at the end of last year.But we said, well, on the bright side,our harbor seals at least will not bebursting into flame anytime soon.So then I got really curious,myself, as a toxicologist,and I donated some blood to my laband said, "Okay, let's do it."Well, we detected 113 different compoundsin my blood.And I must say, if any of you would have this done,you'd probably find a similar profile,or cocktail, as they call it.But I was the recipientof a lot of flame retardant material for some reason.And just to point out the levels --Americans have 10 to 40 times higherlevels of these compounds in our bodiesthan the Europeans.Why? Because we are flame-retarding everything,and we have weak regulationsfor toxic chemicals.But lo and behold, I'm one of the high-end individuals.Lucky me.But then I thought,well, in case of a fire, I might be the last one to ignite.(Laughter)So anyway, here's the problem --and it is a problem that we're looking at in the Gulf today --we're not regulating chemicals in this country properly.We're hardly regulating them at all.And we're letting industry run the show.And Jackie Savitz spoke this morningabout Big Oiland the propagandaand how we're all brainwashedwith their, you know, lies and so forth.Well, Big Chemicalis what we're dealing with here.And they're allowed to keep trade secrets,so they don't even give the ingredients out.Plus they don't give health and safety data,so, consequently, they cannot be regulatedbefore they go to market.So it's a case of innocent until proven guilty.The burden of proof is not on the producer.So I then was invited to goto the Gulf in May.I went down there ona preliminary investigationto look into dispersantsand how they're going into the water column and so forth.And I was told that I wasthe only toxicologist to datewho was dumb enough to get into the water,but I did.And we dove in the slickwithout even HazMat gear.And I did get sick.I got a ferocious sore throat two days later.I felt like my throat was on fire.But it did pass.And what I did see in the water as we went down,what really shocked me -- and it's haunted me ever since --because I could see the droplets of oil dispersing.And as you go down, they're catching all kinds of plankton,bumping into,you know, little wisps of lifethat are the food for the planktivores,the herring kind of fish.And you could just see the web of deathas you go down in the water column.Well, you know, we got into thisin the beginningas a trade-off, they say,between the wetlands versus the ocean depth.And I didn't agree with thatdecision at the time; I still don't.The decision was to protect the marshes.When the oil gets into the marshes, you can't get it out.And as you know, there's been a very weak response,up until recently,to actually collect the oil.It's gotten much more aggressive.This is an Exxon slide showing what happens,the scenario and the trade-off.So this shows oil on the surface.You can see it getting up into the mangrove,but it is not harming the coralsor the sea grass, right.So here we have the other scenario.If you disperse, the sea grass and the coralsare getting hit pretty hard,but you're saving the mangrove.So this, to me, is like going to the eye doctor, okay?Is it better with one or two?(Laughter)The problem is that we havereleased so darn much of this stuff,we're climbing up to two million gallonsvery quickly.And then there's the problem of the plumes.What plumes?It turns out there are plumes.Independent researchers found that.And then there's the looming,messy problem of human health,reported human health effects.And actually, one of our federal officialssaid that it was probably heat stress. So ...Having been in that waterjust for the short time I was there,I can tell you, it is not heat stress.There are volumes of volatilepetroleum fumes coming off that water,plus the Corexit,which has solvent in it.So it is not at all rational.So what do we have? The BP show is going on.Our officials complained about Corexit,which is the most toxicline of dispersants.But heck, they're still using it,and they used the most toxic one, the 9527,until they ran out of supplies.Now they're on 9500.9527 had 2-butoxyethanol in itthat causes internal bleeding.We know that from the Exxon Valdez spill, by the way.So what we're doing, we're putting compoundswith petroleum solvents onto a petroleum spill.Does this make sense?So this is the way it works.And I want to show you this cute little thing that happens here.It's a micelle.Micelles form around the oil.And what happens firstis the solvents break into the oil,the lipid membrane,they let the surfactants in there.The surfactants -- which are like thingswe use on fast food wrappers --they grab around the droplets of oil,and they make little, tiny dropletswith nice, littlesurfactant edges to them.The thing to remember about the micelles --these little floatingglobules of toxin --is they are there to deliver.They're like the FedEx guys.And if you're a fish,and you haven't gotten your glob in the morning,you're going to get it in the afternoon,because they've got your number.So from a toxicology perspective,this is really awfulbecause Corexit and the dispersed oilare much more toxic togetherthan either alone.And usually the exposureis a combined exposure.The dispersants -- as I was saying --their job is to break downthe lipid membrane.The solvents in them do that very efficiently.So they break downlipid membranes in our body,starting with cells of the skin,the cells of organs.So it actually hastensoil getting into the bodyeasily and readily.Oil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compoundsand other compoundsthat are toxic to every organ in the body.And so with the dispersants combined,you have this very synergisticcombined toxicity.Corexit also contains petroleum solventsand many other toxic compounds.And I'm part of a chat group,which is a national groupof toxicologists and chemiststhat are, you know, basicallyturning cartwheels trying to figure out what's in this stuff,and what is it doing and what are the interactionsof these chemicals, most of which we don't know,and what are their byproducts,which are usually more toxic than the parent compound.So we did find that Corexit 9500contains heavy metals, arsenic and chromium --arsenic at high enough levelsto have cancer-causing effects.So this is what we have to look at,these, you know, ridiculous safety data sheets,which have nothing on them much.And now they were forced to release the ultimate listof everything that's in Corexit.And guess what,tons of stuff is missing.Derivatives, derivatives, these are whole big groupsof many, many compounds, these sorbitans.And then you get down to the petroleum distillates,which are the solvents,hundreds of them.They are not identified. And why?Trade secrets again.BP's running the show,and the Nalco company, this is all they have to do.So far these ingredients have not been released,and toxicologists are actually going nutsbecause we cannot predict with certaintywhat the interactionsand toxic results are going to be.But we do have quite a lot at riskdown there, as we all know,the 33 wildlife refuges,so much wildlifeand fish and diversity.So we know from previous spills.And then part of this is justpart of my bad dreams.And I appreciate being ableto vent some of myanguish upon you.What we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard.And this is a study that was doneon the Australian coast,the coast of Tasmania.Corals are, you know, the home toabout a quarter of all marine species.And with the Corexitand the oil,there's zero percent fertilization.With oil alone, there's 98 percent fertilization.So they're a very sensitive speciesto this combo.Here's another group.I could see myself easily in the water column.The plankton and the plankton eaters,you know, these are the little herring fishthat go through the water column with their mouths open,feeding indiscriminatelyand just lapping upthis brown pudding of toxic stuff.And we do know from other studiesthat this is a highly toxic mixture.See the oil and Corexit is causing deathat a much, much lower dosethan oil alone.That's probably as far as what we do knowabout toxic effects.But my bad dreams go like this.The piscivorous fish,the cobia, grouper, amberjacks, those big fish,also the tuna and sharks,are going to hit by this.And the gills are quite sensitive.The respiratory system is very sensitive.Think about it withthe Corexit hitting the membranes,and it will clog up the gills,and then these animals are going to begetting something like what you callchemical pneumonia,trying to aspirate the compounds.It also will cause internal bleedingupon ingestion.I'm very worried about the air-breathing mammals because I study them,but also, the way their going to be exposedis every time they come to the surface to take a breath,they're going to inhale these volatile fumes.And what does happen with that eventuallyis pneumonia sets inand liver, kidney, brain damage.The Corexitis transporting the oilinto every membraneand every system of the body.And you're havinga lot of different unpleasant effects,but burns to the eyes and mouth,skin ulcers, lesions.And I think, personally,that we have not begun to seethe impacts of this spillon the wildlife of the Gulf.We started hypothesizing:what do we know?what do with think would be a trophic cascade?which means that somebody gets wiped out,and then everything abovethat's eating those guys will crash.So our thought was --this is a simple thinking process, but ...obviously the plankton, the planktivores,and that's about as far as we got.And then it turns out we're not very good at figuring this stuff out.This is what the Exxon Valdez scientists thought would happen,this trophic cascadewhere you lose the kelp and the herringand other fishes and going up.They thought that eventually the killer whalewould be at the top of this cascade.And then here's what really happened,much more complicated, much more specific.Actually the kelpand the barnacles that attach to the rockwere decimated by the combinationof Corexit and the oil.They were replaced by invasive species,which had less holding power to the rock.Storms came along.They ripped out of the rock.And this was the entire food web for the sea ducks.And as you know, we lost about 300,000 sea ducksfrom the Exxon Valdez spill,and they haven't come back.So we are launchingan independent study.And by independent, I do not mean alone;I mean independent in the senseof not tied tothe kind of crime-scene secrecythat's going on in the Gulf now.But we are actually going to be assessing toxic impacts,but we need lots and lots of partnersto do this intelligently.We have some of the partners lined up.And Dave Gallo signed on.Sylvia's in here.And we hope that some of you will help us.My question to you is: why shouldn't we know?Don't we have the right to know?Surely we have the right to learnwhat loss we are going through in the Gulf.And my wish would be --for the gulf prize -- would bethat we have the truth.Whatever it is, please let us have the truth.And to get there,we need to do the assessment.So I appreciate being here. Thank you.(Applause)

Today, I'm going to take youaround the world in 18 minutes.My base of operations is in the U.S.,but let's start at the other end of the map,in Kyoto, Japan,where I was living with a Japanese familywhile I was doing part of my dissertational research15 years ago.I knew even then that I would encountercultural differences and misunderstandings,but they popped up when I least expected it.On my first day,I went to a restaurant,and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar.After a pause, the waiter said,"One does not put sugar in green tea.""I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.But I really like my tea sweet."In response, he gave me an even more courteous versionof the same explanation."One does not put sugarin green tea.""I understand," I said,"that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea,but I'd like to put some sugarin my green tea."(Laughter)Surprised by my insistence,the waiter took up the issue with the manager.Pretty soon,a lengthy discussion ensued,and finally the manager came over to me and said,"I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."(Laughter)Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it,I ordered a cup of coffee,which the waiter brought over promptly.Resting on the saucerwere two packets of sugar.My failure to procure myselfa cup of sweet, green teawas not due to a simple misunderstanding.This was due to a fundamental differencein our ideas about choice.From my American perspective,when a paying customer makes a reasonable requestbased on her preferences,she has every right to have that request met.The American way, to quote Burger King,is to "have it your way,"because, as Starbucks says,"happiness is in your choices."(Laughter)But from the Japanese perspective,it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better --(Laughter)in this case, the ignorant gaijin --from making the wrong choice.Let's face it: the way I wanted my teawas inappropriate according to cultural standards,and they were doing their best to help me save face.Americans tend to believethat they've reached some sort of pinnaclein the way they practice choice.They think that choice, as seen through the American lensbest fulfills an innate and universaldesire for choice in all humans.Unfortunately,these beliefs are based on assumptionsthat don't always hold truein many countries, in many cultures.At times they don't even hold trueat America's own borders.I'd like to discuss some of these assumptionsand the problems associated with them.As I do so, I hope you'll start thinkingabout some of your own assumptionsand how they were shaped by your backgrounds.First assumption:if a choice affects you,then you should be the one to make it.This is the only way to ensurethat your preferences and interestswill be most fully accounted for.It is essential for success.In America, the primary locus of choiceis the individual.People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns,regardless of what other people want or recommend.It's called "being true to yourself."But do all individuals benefitfrom taking such an approach to choice?Mark Lepper and I did a series of studiesin which we sought the answer to this very question.In one study,which we ran in Japantown, San Francisco,we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American childreninto the laboratory,and we divided them up into three groups.The first group came in,and they were greeted by Miss Smith,who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do,and they even got to choose which markerthey would write their answers with.When the second group of children came in,they were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams,but this time Miss Smith told themwhich anagrams to doand which markers to write their answers with.Now when the third group came in,they were told that their anagrams and their markershad been chosen by their mothers.(Laughter)In reality,the kids who were told what to do,whether by Miss Smith or their mothers,were actually given the very same activity,which their counterparts in the first grouphad freely chosen.With this procedure, we were able to ensurethat the kids across the three groupsall did the same activity,making it easier for us to compare performance.Such small differences in the way we administered the activityyielded striking differencesin how well they performed.Anglo-Americans,they did two and a half times more anagramswhen they got to choose them,as compared to when it waschosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.It didn't matter who did the choosing,if the task was dictated by another,their performance suffered.In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassedwhen they were told that their mothers had been consulted.(Laughter)One girl named Mary said,"You asked my mother?"(Laughter)In contrast,Asian-American childrenperformed best when they believedtheir mothers had made the choice,second best when they chose for themselves,and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith.A girl named Natsumieven approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the roomand tugged on her skirt and asked,"Could you please tell my mommyI did it just like she said?"The first-generation children were strongly influencedby their immigrant parents'approach to choice.For them, choice was not just a wayof defining and assertingtheir individuality,but a way to create community and harmonyby deferring to the choicesof people whom they trusted and respected.If they had a concept of being true to one's self,then that self, most likely,[was] composed, not of an individual,but of a collective.Success was just as much about pleasing key figuresas it was about satisfyingone's own preferences.Or, you could say thatthe individual's preferences were shapedby the preferences of specific others.The assumption then that we do bestwhen the individual self choosesonly holdswhen that selfis clearly divided from others.When, in contrast,two or more individualssee their choices and their outcomesas intimately connected,then they may amplify one another's successby turning choosinginto a collective act.To insist that they choose independentlymight actually compromiseboth their performanceand their relationships.Yet that is exactly whatthe American paradigm demands.It leaves little room for interdependenceor an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.It requires that everyone treat choiceas a private and self-defining act.People that have grown up in such a paradigmmight find it motivating,but it is a mistake to assumethat everyone thrives under the pressureof choosing alone.The second assumption which informs the American view of choicegoes something like this.The more choices you have,the more likely you areto make the best choice.So bring it on, Walmart, with 100,000 different products,and Amazon, with 27 million booksand Match.com with -- what is it? --15 million date possibilities now.You will surely find the perfect match.Let's test this assumptionby heading over to Eastern Europe.Here, I interviewed peoplewho were residents of formerly communist countries,who had all faced the challengeof transitioning to a moredemocratic and capitalistic society.One of the most interesting revelationscame not from an answer to a question,but from a simple gesture of hospitality.When the participants arrived for their interview,I offered them a set of drinks:Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite --seven, to be exact.During the very first session,which was run in Russia,one of the participants made a commentthat really caught me off guard."Oh, but it doesn't matter.It's all just soda. That's just one choice."(Murmuring)I was so struck by this comment that from then on,I started to offer all the participantsthose seven sodas,and I asked them, "How many choices are these?"Again and again,they perceived these seven different sodas,not as seven choices, but as one choice:soda or no soda.When I put out juice and waterin addition to these seven sodas,now they perceived it as only three choices --juice, water and soda.Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans,not just to a particular flavor of soda,but to a particular brand.You know, research shows repeatedlythat we can't actually tell the differencebetween Coke and Pepsi.Of course, you and I knowthat Coke is the better choice.(Laughter)For modern Americans who are exposedto more options and more ads associated with optionsthan anyone else in the world,choice is just as much about who they areas it is about what the product is.Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better,and you have a group of people for whom every little difference mattersand so every choice matters.But for Eastern Europeans,the sudden availability of all theseconsumer products on the marketplace was a deluge.They were flooded with choicebefore they could protest that they didn't know how to swim.When asked, "What words and imagesdo you associate with choice?"Grzegorz from Warsaw said,"Ah, for me it is fear.There are some dilemmas you see.I am used to no choice."Bohdan from Kiev said,in response to how he felt aboutthe new consumer marketplace,"It is too much.We do not need everything that is there."A sociologist fromthe Warsaw Survey Agency explained,"The older generation jumped from nothingto choice all around them.They were never given a chance to learnhow to react."And Tomasz, a young Polish man said,"I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum.I don't mean to say that I want no choice,but many of these choices are quite artificial."In reality, many choices are between thingsthat are not that much different.The value of choicedepends on our abilityto perceive differencesbetween the options.Americans train their whole livesto play "spot the difference."They practice this from such an early agethat they've come to believe that everyonemust be born with this ability.In fact, though all humans sharea basic need and desire for choice,we don't all see choice in the same placesor to the same extent.When someone can't see how one choiceis unlike another,or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast,the process of choosing can beconfusing and frustrating.Instead of making better choices,we become overwhelmed by choice,sometimes even afraid of it.Choice no longer offers opportunities,but imposes constraints.It's not a marker of liberation,but of suffocationby meaningless minutiae.In other words,choice can develop into the very oppositeof everything it representsin Americawhen it is thrust upon thosewho are insufficiently prepared for it.But it is not only other peoplein other placesthat are feeling the pressureof ever-increasing choice.Americans themselves are discoveringthat unlimited choiceseems more attractive in theorythan in practice.We all have physical, mentaland emotional (Laughter) limitationsthat make it impossible for usto process every single choice we encounter,even in the grocery store,let alone over the course of our entire lives.A number of my studies have shownthat when you give people 10 or more optionswhen they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions,whether it be health care, investment,other critical areas.Yet still, many of us believethat we should make all our own choicesand seek out even more of them.This brings me to the third,and perhaps most problematic, assumption:"You must neversay no to choice."To examine this, let's go back to the U.S.and then hop across the pond to France.Right outside Chicago,a young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell,were about to have their first baby.They'd already picked out a name for her,Barbara, after her grandmother.One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant,she started to experience contractionsand was rushed to the emergency room.The baby was delivered through a C-section,but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia,a loss of oxygen to the brain.Unable to breathe on her own,she was put on a ventilator.Two days later,the doctors gave the Mitchellsa choice:They could either remove Barbaraoff the life support,in which case she would die within a matter of hours,or they could keep her on life support,in which case she might still diewithin a matter of days.If she survived, she would remainin a permanent vegetative state,never able to walk, talkor interact with others.What do they do?What do any parent do?In a study I conductedwith Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali,American and French parentswere interviewed.They had all sufferedthe same tragedy.In all cases, the life support was removed,and the infants had died.But there was a big difference.In France, the doctors decided whether and whenthe life support would be removed,while in the United States,the final decision rested with the parents.We wondered:does this have an effect on how the parentscope with the loss of their loved one?We found that it did.Even up to a year later,American parentswere more likely to express negative emotions,as compared to their French counterparts.French parents were more likely to say things like,"Noah was here for so little time,but he taught us so much.He gave us a new perspective on life."American parents were more likely to say things like,"What if? What if?"Another parent complained,"I feel as if they purposefully tortured me.How did they get me to do that?"And another parent said,"I feel as if I've played a rolein an execution."But when the American parents were askedif they would rather have hadthe doctors make the decision,they all said, "No."They could not imagineturning that choice over to another,even though having made that choicemade them feel trapped,guilty, angry.In a number of casesthey were even clinically depressed.These parents could not contemplategiving up the choice,because to do so would have gone contraryto everything they had been taughtand everything they had come to believeabout the powerand purpose of choice.In her essay, "The White Album,"Joan Didion writes,"We tell ourselves storiesin order to live.We interpret what we see,select the most workableof the multiple choices.We live entirely by the impositionof a narrative lineupon disparate images,by the idea with which we have learned to freezethe shifting phantasmagoria,which is our actual experience."The story Americans tell,the story upon whichthe American dream depends,is the story of limitless choice.This narrativepromises so much:freedom, happiness,success.It lays the world at your feet and says,"You can have anything, everything."It's a great story,and it's understandable why they would be reluctantto revise it.But when you take a close look,you start to see the holes,and you start to see that the storycan be told in many other ways.Americans have so often tried todisseminate their ideas of choice,believing that they will be, or ought to be,welcomed with open hearts and minds.But the history books and the daily news tell usit doesn't always work out that way.The phantasmagoria,the actual experience that we try to understandand organize through narrative,varies from place to place.No single narrative serves the needsof everyone everywhere.Moreover, Americans themselvescould benefit from incorporatingnew perspectives into their own narrative,which has been driving their choicesfor so long.Robert Frost once said that,"It is poetry that is lost in translation."This suggests thatwhatever is beautiful and moving,whatever gives us a new way to see,cannot be communicated to thosewho speak a different language.But Joseph Brodsky said that,"It is poetrythat is gained in translation,"suggesting that translationcan be a creative,transformative act.When it comes to choice,we have far more to gain than to loseby engaging in the manytranslations of the narratives.Instead of replacingone story with another,we can learn from and revel inthe many versions that existand the many that have yet to be written.No matter where we're fromand what your narrative is,we all have a responsibilityto open ourselves up to a wider arrayof what choice can do,and what it can represent.And this does not lead toa paralyzing moral relativism.Rather, it teaches us whenand how to act.It brings us that much closerto realizing the full potential of choice,to inspiring the hopeand achieving the freedomthat choice promisesbut doesn't always deliver.If we learn to speak to one another,albeit through translation,then we can begin to see choicein all its strangeness,complexityand compelling beauty.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you.Sheena, there is a detail about your biographythat we have not written in the program book.But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is:How does that influence your study of choosingbecause that's an activitythat for most people is associated with visual inputslike aesthetics and color and so on?Sheena Iyengar: Well, it's funny that you should ask thatbecause one of the things that's interesting about being blindis you actually get a different vantage pointwhen you observe the waysighted people make choices.And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out therethat are very visual these days.Yeah, I -- as you would expect --get pretty frustrated by choiceslike what nail polish to put onbecause I have to rely on what other people suggest.And I can't decide.And so one time I was in a beauty salon,and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink.And one was called "Ballet Slippers."And the other one was called "Adorable."(Laughter)And so I asked these two ladies,and the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'""Well, what does it look like?""Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink.""Okay, great."The other lady tells me to wear "Adorable.""What does it look like?""It's a glamorous shade of pink."And so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart?What's different about them?"And they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous."Okay, we got that.And the only thing they had consensus on:well, if I could see them, I wouldclearly be able to tell them apart.(Laughter)And what I wondered was whether they were being affectedby the name or the content of the color,so I decided to do a little experiment.So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory,and I stripped the labels off.And I brought women into the laboratory,and I asked them, "Which one would you pick?"50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick,of putting the same color nail polishin both those bottles.(Laughter)(Applause)At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on.Now, of the women that could tell them apart,when the labels were off, they picked "Adorable,"and when the labels were on,they picked "Ballet Slippers."So as far as I can tell,a rose by any other nameprobably does look differentand maybe even smells different.BG: Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena.(Applause)

When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s,the future of the world was bleak.The population explosion was unstoppable.Global famine was inevitable.A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environmentwas going to shorten our lives.The acid rain was falling on the forests.The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.The oil was running out,and a nuclear winter would finish us off.None of those things happened,(Laughter)and astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime,the average per-capita incomeof the average person on the planet,in real terms, adjusted for inflation,has tripled.Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime.Child mortality is down by two-thirds.Per-capita food productionis up by a third.And all this at a time when the population has doubled.How did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not?How did we achieve that?How did we becomethe only speciesthat becomes more prosperousas it becomes more populous?The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population,and the level of the graphrepresents GDP per capita.I think to answer that questionyou need to understandhow human beings bring together their brainsand enable their ideas to combine and recombine,to meet and, indeed, to mate.In other words, you need to understandhow ideas have sex.I want you to imaginehow we got from making objects like thisto making objects like this.These are both real objects.One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years agoof the kind made by Homo erectus.The other is obviously a computer mouse.They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.I've tried to work out which is bigger,and it's almost impossible.And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.The differences are what interest me,because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying designfor about a million years --from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.Homo erectus made the same toolfor 30,000 generations.Of course there were a few changes,but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.There was no progress, no innovation.It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.And there's another difference too,which is the object on the left is made from one substance.The object on the right is made froma confection of different substances,from silicon and metal and plastic and so on.And more than that, it's a confection of different ideas,the idea of plastic, the idea of a laser,the idea of transistors.They've all been combined together in this technology.And it's this combination,this cumulative technology, that intrigues me,because I think it's the secret to understandingwhat's happening in the world.My body's an accumulation of ideas too:the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.They've come together.How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?Well, it uses sexual reproduction.In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures,a green one and a red one,then one has to be better than the other.One goes extinct for the other to survive.But if you have a sexual species,then it's possible for an individualto inherit both mutationsfrom different lineages.So what sex does is it enables the individualto draw uponthe genetic innovations of the whole species.It's not confined to its own lineage.What's the process that's having the same effectin cultural evolutionas sex is having in biological evolution?And I think the answer is exchange,the habit of exchanging one thing for another.It's a unique human feature.No other animal does it.You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange --and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals --But the exchange of one object for another never happens.As Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dogmake a fair exchange of a bone with another dog."(Laughter)You can have culture without exchange.You can have, as it were, asexual culture.Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.They teach each other traditionswhich are handed down from parent to offspring.In this case, chimpanzees teaching each otherhow to crack nuts with rocks.But the difference isthat these cultures never expand, never grow,never accumulate, never become combinatorial,and the reason is becausethere is no sex, as it were,there is no exchange of ideas.Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.There's no exchange of ideas between them.And why does exchange raise living standards?Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.And here is a Stone Age version of his story,although he told it in terms of trade between countries.Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.He doesn't need Adam.He can make his own spears and axes.Well no, because if you think about it,if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes,and then they trade,then they will each have saved an hour of work.And the more they do this, the more true it's going to be,because the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axesand the better Oz is going to get at making spears.So the gains from trade are only going to grow.And this is one of the beauties of exchange,is it actually creates the momentumfor more specialization,which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on.Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time.That is prosperity, the saving of timein satisfying your needs.Ask yourself how long you would have to workto provide for yourselfan hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.How long do you actually have to workto earn an hour of reading lightif you're on the average wage in Britain today?And the answer is about half a second.Back in 1950,you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wageto acquire that much light.And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gainedsince 1950, as it were,because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else,or you can acquire another good or service.And back in 1880,it would have been 15 minutesto earn that amount of light on the average wage.Back in 1800,you'd have had to work six hoursto earn a candle that could burn for an hour.In other words, the average person on the average wagecould not afford a candle in 1800.Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse,and ask yourself: "Who made them and for who?"The stone axe was made by someone for himself.It was self-sufficiency.We call that poverty these days.But the object on the rightwas made for me by other people.How many other people?Tens? Hundreds? Thousands?You know, I think it's probably millions.Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee,which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig,who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.They were all working for me,to make a mouse for me.And that's the way society works.That's what we've achieved as a species.In the old days, if you were rich,you literally had people working for you.That's how you got to be rich; you employed them.Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him.They made his silly outfits, like this,(Laughter)and they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.He had 498 peopleto prepare his dinner every night.But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versaillesand looking at Louis XIV's pictures,he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.They're in bistros and cafes and restaurantsand shops all over Paris,and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent mealthat's probably got higher qualitythan Louis XIV even had.And that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other.We're able to draw upon specialization and exchangeto raise each other's living standards.Now, you do get other animals working for each other too.Ants are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.But there's a big difference,which is that it only happens within the colony.There's no working for each other across the colonies.And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor.That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.The queen does it all.In our species, we don't like doing that.It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.(Laughter)Even in England, we don't leave reproduction to the Queen.(Applause)So when did this habit start?And how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?Well, I think, probably, the oldest version of thisis probably the sexual division of labor.But I've got no evidence for that.It just looks like the first thing we didwas work male for female and female for male.In all hunter-gatherer societies today,there's a foraging division of laborbetween, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females.It isn't always quite that simple,but there's a distinction betweenspecialized roles for males and females.And the beauty of this systemis that it benefits both sides.The woman knowsthat, in the Hadzas' case here --digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat --she knows that all she has to do to get access to proteinis to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat.And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting huntand try and kill a warthog.And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any diggingto get roots.All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthogit's big enough to share some.And so both sides raise each other's standards of livingthrough the sexual division of labor.When did this happen? We don't know, but it's possiblethat Neanderthals didn't do this.They were a highly cooperative species.They were a highly intelligent species.Their brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and minein this room today.They were imaginative. They buried their dead.They had language, probably,because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us,which was discovered here in Oxford.And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills.They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals.But there's no evidenceof a sexual division of labor.There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men.And the other thing there's no evidence foris exchange between groups,because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains,the tools they made,are always made from local materials.For example, in the Caucasusthere's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.They're always made from local chert.In the same valley there are modern human remainsfrom about the same date, 30,000 years ago,and some of those are from local chert,but more -- but many of them are madefrom obsidian from a long way away.And when human beings beganmoving objects around like this,it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups.Trade is 10 times as old as farming.People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing.Exchange between groups has been going onfor a hundred thousand years.And the earliest evidence for it crops upsomewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa,when you see obsidian and jasper and other thingsmoving long distances in Ethiopia.You also see seashells --as discovered by a team here in Oxford --moving 125 miles inlandfrom the Mediterranean in Algeria.And that's evidence that peoplehave started exchanging between groups.And that will have led to specialization.How do you know that long-distance movementmeans trade rather than migration?Well, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals,who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa,which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.They traded them with their neighborsfor things like stingray barbs,and the consequence was that stone axesended up over a large part of Australia.So long-distance movement of toolsis a sign of trade, not migration.What happens when you cut people off from exchange,from the ability to exchange and specialize?And the answer is thatnot only do you slow down technological progress,you can actually throw it into reverse.An example is Tasmania.When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago,the people on it not only experiencedslower progress than people on the mainland,they actually experienced regress.They gave up the ability to make stone toolsand fishing equipment and clothingbecause the population of about 4,000 peoplewas simply not large enoughto maintain the specialized skillsnecessary to keep the technology they had.It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.How many of the things in our pocketscould we continue to make after 10,000 years?It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego --similar island, similar people.The reason: because Tierra del Fuegois separated from South America by a much narrower straight,and there was trading contact across that straightthroughout 10,000 years.The Tasmanians were isolated.Go back to this image againand ask yourself, not only who made it and for who,but who knew how to make it.In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.But who knows how to make a computer mouse?Nobody, literally nobody.There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.I mean this quite seriously.The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know.He just knows how to run a company.The person on the assembly line doesn't knowbecause he doesn't know how to drill an oil wellto get oil out to make plastic, and so on.We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.I am of course quoting from a famous essayby Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s,called "I, Pencil"in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made,and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil,because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite,and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing.And what we've done in human society,through exchange and specialization,is we've createdthe ability to do things that we don't even understand.It's not the same with language.With language we have to transfer ideasthat we understand with each other.But with technology,we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities.We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mindto an extraordinary degree.And by the way,that's one of the reasons that I'm not interestedin the debate about I.Q.,about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups.It's completely irrelevant.What's relevant to a societyis how well people are communicating their ideas,and how well they're cooperating,not how clever the individuals are.So we've created something called the collective brain.We're just the nodes in the network.We're the neurons in this brain.It's the interchange of ideas,the meeting and mating of ideas between them,that is causing technological progress,incrementally, bit by bit.However, bad things happen.And in the future, as we go forward,we will, of course, experience terrible things.There will be wars; there will be depressions;there will be natural disasters.Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.But I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making,and the ability of ideasto meet and to mateas never before,I'm also surethat technology will advance,and therefore living standards will advance.Because through the cloud,through crowd sourcing,through the bottom-up world that we've created,where not just the elites but everybodyis able to have their ideasand make them meet and mate,we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.Thank you.(Applause)

I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadershipin the 21st century.In the 21st century, we need to actually look at --and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today --is to go back to our school dayswhen we learned how to count.But I think it's time for us to think about what we count.Because what we actually counttruly counts.Let me start by telling you a little story.This is Van Quach.She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.She changed her name to Vivianbecause she wanted to fit in here in America.Her first job was at an inner-city motelin San Francisco as a maid.I happened to buy that motelabout three months after Vivian started working there.So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.With the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old,in 1987,I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,a very impractical name,because I actually was looking to create joy of life.And this first hotel that I bought, motel,was a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motelin the inner-city of San Francisco.As I spent time with Vivian,I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivrein how she did her work.It made me question and curious:How could someone actually find joyin cleaning toilets for a living?So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw thatshe didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.Her job, her goal and her callingwas not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.What counts for Vivian was the emotional connectionshe created with her fellow employees and our guests.And what gave her inspiration and meaningwas the fact that she was taking care of peoplewho were far away from home.Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.That very human lesson,more than 20 years ago,served me well during the lasteconomic downturn we had.In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,San Francisco Bay Area hotelswent through the largest percentage revenue dropin the history of American hotels.We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,so we were particularly vulnerable.But also back then,remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.Well, not exactly, of course not.We started eating "freedom fries,"and we started boycotting anything that was French.Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre --so I started getting these lettersfrom places like Alabama and Orange Countysaying to me that they were going to boycott my companybecause they thought we were a French company.And I'd write them back, and I'd say, "What a minute. We're not French.We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco."And I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse."(Laughter)So one particular daywhen I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstorelooking for a business solution.But given my befuddled state of mind, I ended upin the self-help section very quickly.That's where I got reacquainted withAbraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs."I took one psychology class in college,and I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.But as I sat there for four hours,the full afternoon, reading Maslow,I recognized somethingthat is true of most leaders.One of the simplest facts in businessis something that we often neglect,and that is that we're all human.Each of us, no matter what our role is in business,has some hierarchy of needsin the workplace.So as I started reading more Maslow,what I started to realize is thatMaslow, later in his life,wanted to take this hierarchy for the individualand apply it to the collective,to organizations and specifically to business.But unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.So I realized in that dotcom crashthat my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.And that's what I did a few years agowhen I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramidand turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,which is survival, success and transformation.It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.And we started asking ourselves the questionsabout how we were actually addressingthe higher needs, these transformational needsfor our key employees in the company.These three levels of the hierarchy needsrelate to the five levelsof Maslow's hierarchy of needs.But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressingthe higher needs of our employees and our customers,I realized we had no metrics.We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.So we started asking ourselves:What kind of less obvious metricscould we use to actually evaluateour employees' sense of meaning,or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us?For example, we actually started asking our employees,do they understand the mission of our company,and do they feel like they believe in it,can they actually influence it,and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?We started asking our customers,did they feel an emotional connection with us,in one of seven different kinds of ways.Miraculously, as we asked these questionsand started giving attention higher up the pyramid,what we found is we created more loyalty.Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.Our employee turnover droppedto one-third of the industry average,and during that five year dotcom bust,we tripled in size.As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out thereand asking them how they were getting through that time,what they told me over and over againwas that they just manage what they can measure.What we can measure is that tangible stuffat the bottom of the pyramid.They didn't even see the intangible stuffhigher up the pyramid.So I started asking myself the question:How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,and all we can measure is the tangible in life,we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.So I went out and studied a bunch of things,and I found a survey that showedthat 94 percentof business leaders worldwidebelieve that the intangibles are important in their business,things like intellectual property,their corporate culture, their brand loyalty,and yet, only five percent of those same leadersactually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.So as leaders, we understandthat intangibles are important,but we don't have a clue how to measure them.So here's another Einstein quote:"Not everything that can be counted counts,and not everything that counts can be counted."I hate to argue with Einstein,but if that which is most valuablein our life and our businessactually can't be counted or valued,aren't we going to spend our livesjust mired in measuring the mundane?It was that sort of heady question about what countsthat led me to take my CEO hat off for a weekand fly off to the Himalayan peaks.I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries,a place some folks call Shangri-La.It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramidto becoming a transformationalrole model for the world.I went to Bhutan.The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,but this was back in 1972,when he ascended to the thronetwo days after his father passed away.At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questionsthat you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind.On a trip through India,early in his reign as king,he was asked by an Indian journalistabout the Bhutanese GDP,the size of the Bhutanese GDP.The king responded in a fashionthat actually has transformed us four decades later.He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessedand focused with gross domestic product?Why don't we care more aboutgross national happiness?"Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consideran alternative definition of success,what has come to be known asGNH, or gross national happiness.Most world leaders didn't take notice,and those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics."But the king was serious.This was a notable moment,because this was the first time a world leaderin almost 200 yearshad suggestedthat intangible of happiness --that leader 200 years ago,Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence --200 years later,this king was suggesting that intangible of happinessis something that we should measure,and it's something we should actually valueas government officials.For the next three dozen years as king,this king actually started measuringand managing around happiness in Bhutan --including, just recently, taking his countryfrom being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchywith no bloodshed, no coup.Bhutan, for those of you who don't know it,is the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago.So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement,I got to really understand what they're doing.And I got to spend some time with the prime minister.Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.I asked him,"How can you create and measuresomething which evaporates --in other words, happiness?"And he's a very wise man, and he said,"Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.We create the conditions for happiness to occur.In other words, we create a habitat of happiness."Wow, that's interesting.He said that they have a science behind that art,and they've actually created four essential pillars,nine key indicatorsand 72 different metricsthat help them to measure their GNH.One of those key indicators is:How do the Bhutanese feel abouthow they spend their time each day?It's a good question. How do you feel abouthow you spend your time each day?Time is one of the scarcest resourcesin the modern world.And yet, of course,that little intangible piece of datadoesn't factor into our GDP calculations.As I spent my week up in the Himalayas,I started to imaginewhat I call an emotional equation.And it focuses on something I read long agofrom a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.How many know him? Anybody?1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living,"and he suggested that happinessis not about having what you want;instead, it's about wanting what you have.Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believehappiness equals wanting what you have --imagine gratitude --divided by having what you want --gratification.The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill,constantly focused on what they don't have.Their religion, their isolation,their deep respect for their cultureand now the principles of their GNH movementall have fostered a sense of gratitudeabout what they do have.How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,spend more of our timein the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?We are a bottom-heavy culturein more ways than one.(Laughter)The reality is, in Western countries,quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happinessas if happiness is something that we have to go out --an object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects.Actually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,many dictionaries define pursuitas to "chase with hostility."Do we pursue happiness with hostility?Good question. But back to Bhutan.Bhutan's bordered on its north and southby 38 percent of the world's population.Could this little country,like a startup in a mature industry,be the spark plug that influencesa 21st centuryof middle-class in China and India?Bhutan's created the ultimate export,a new global currency of well-being,and there are 40 countries around the world todaythat are studying their own GNH.You may have heard, this last fallNicolas Sarkozy in Franceannouncing the results of an 18-month studyby two Nobel economists,focusing on happiness and wellness in France.Sarkozy suggested thatworld leaders should stopmyopically focusing on GDPand consider a new index,what some French are calling a "joie de vivre index."I like it.Co-branding opportunities.Just three days ago, three days ago here at TED,we had a simulcast of David Cameron,potentially the next prime minister of the UK,quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time,Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968when he suggested that we'remyopically focused on the wrong thingand that GDP is a misplaced metric.So it suggests that the momentum is shifting.I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote,and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.This is a collection of thingsthat Robert Kennedy said in that quote.GDP counts everything from air pollutionto the destruction of our redwoods.But it doesn't count the health of our childrenor the integrity of our public officials.As you look at these two columns here,doesn't it make you feel like it's time for usto start figuring out a new way to count,a new way to imaginewhat's important to us in life?(Applause)Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that.He said GDP "measures everything in short,except that which makes life worthwhile."Wow.So how do we do that?Let me say one thing we can just start doingten years from now, at least in this country.Why in the heck in Americaare we doing a census in 2010?We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity.But all of those questions are tangible.They're about demographics.They're about where you live, how many people you live with,and whether you own your home or not.That's about it.We're not asking meaningful metrics.We're not asking important questions.We're not asking anything that's intangible.Abe Maslow said long agosomething you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.He said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer,everything starts to look like a nail."We've been fooled by our tool.Excuse that expression.(Laughter)We've been fooled by our tool.GDP has been our hammer.And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-centuryindustrial-era model of success.And yet, 64 percentof the world's GDP todayis in that intangible industry we call service,the service industry, the industry I'm in.And only 36 percent is in the tangible industriesof manufacturing and agriculture.So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox, right?Maybe it's time we get a toolbox thatdoesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life,but actually counts what we most value,the things that are intangible.I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.I learned that economists measure everythingin tangible units of production and consumptionas if each of those tangible unitsis exactly the same.They aren't the same.In fact, as leaders, what we need to learnis that we can influencethe quality of that unit of productionby creating the conditionsfor our employees to live their calling.In Vivian's case,her unit of productionisn't the tangible hours she works,it's the intangible difference she makesduring that one hour of work.This is Dave Arringdale who's actuallybeen a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.He stayed there a hundred timesin the last 20 years,and he's loyal to the property because of the relationshipthat Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.He tells me that he can always counton Vivian and the staff thereto make him feel at home.Why is it thatbusiness leaders and investorsquite often don't see the connectionbetween creating the intangibleof employee happinesswith creating the tangibleof financial profits in their business?We don't have to choose betweeninspired employees and sizable profits,we can have both.In fact, inspired employees quite oftenhelp make sizable profits, right?So what the world needs now,in my opinion,is business leaders and political leaderswho know what to count.We count numbers.We count on people.What really counts is when we actually use our numbersto truly take into account our people.I learned that from a maid in a moteland a king of a country.What can youstart counting today?What one thing can you start counting todaythat actually would be meaningful in your life,whether it's your work life or your business life?Thank you very much.(Applause)

I would be willing to bet that I'm the dumbest guy in the roombecause I couldn't get through school. I struggled with school.But what I knew at a very early agewas that I loved money and I loved businessand I loved this entrepreneurial thing,and I was raised to be an entrepreneur,and what I've been really passionate about ever since --and I've never spoken about this ever, until now --so this is the first time anyone's ever heard it, except my wife three days ago,because she said, "What are you talking about?" and I told her --is that I think we miss an opportunityto find these kidswho have the entrepreneurial traits,and to groom them or show themthat being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing.It's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified,which is what happens in a lot of society.Kids, when we grow up, have dreams,and we have passions, and we have visions,and somehow we get those things crushed.We get told that we need to study harderor be more focused or get a tutor.My parents got me a tutor in French,and I still suck in French.Two years ago, I was the highest-rated lecturerat MIT's entrepreneurial master's program.And it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world.When I was in grade two, I won a city-wide speaking competition,but nobody had ever said,"Hey, this kid's a good speaker.He can't focus, but he loves walking around and getting people energized."No one said, "Get him a coach in speaking."They said, get me a tutor in what I suck at.So as kids show these traits --and we need to start looking for them --I think we should be raising kidsto be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.Unfortunately the school systemis grooming this worldto say, "Hey, let's be a lawyer or let's be a doctor,"and we're missing that opportunity becauseno one ever says, "Hey, be an entrepreneur."Entrepreneurs are people -- because we have a lot of them in this room --who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the worldand we decide to stand up and do it.And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen.We have the ability to get those groups of people around usthat want to kind of build that dream with us,and I think if we could get kidsto embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial,we could change everything in the world that is a problem today.Every problem that's out there, somebody has the idea for.And as a young kid, nobody can say it can't happenbecause you're too dumb to realizethat you couldn't figure it out.I think we have an obligation as parents and a societyto start teaching our kids to fishinstead of giving them the fish --the old parable: "If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime."If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial --the ones that show those traits to be --like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science,what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traitsand taught them to be entrepreneurs?We could actually have all these kids spreading businessesinstead of waiting for government handouts.What we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn't do:Don't hit; don't bite; don't swear.Right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs,you know, and the school system teaches them to go after things likebeing a doctor and being a lawyerand being an accountant and a dentistand a teacher and a pilot.And the media says that it's really cool if we could go outand be a model or a singeror a sports hero like Luongo, Crosby.Our MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs.The reason that I avoided an MBA program --other than the fact that I couldn't get into anybecause I had a 61 percent average out of high schooland then 61 percent average atthe only school in Canada that accepted me, Carlton --but our MBA programs don't teach kids to be entrepreneurs.They teach them to go work in corporations.So who's starting these companies? It's these random few people.Even in popular literature, the only book I've ever found --and this should be on all of your reading lists --the only book I've ever foundthat makes the entrepreneur into the hero is "Atlas Shrugged."Everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneursand say that we're bad people.I look at even my family.Both my grandfathers were entrepreneurs. My dad was an entrepreneur.Both my brother and sister and I, all three of us own companies as well.And we all decided to start these thingsbecause it's really the only place we fit.We didn't fit in the normal work. We couldn't work for somebody elsebecause we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits.But kids could be entrepreneurs as well.I'm a big part of a couple organizations globallycalled the Entrepreneurs' Organization and the Young Presidents' Organization.I just came back from speaking in Barcelonaat the YPO global conference,and everyone that I met over therewho's an entrepreneurstruggled with school.I have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.So this thing right here is freaking me out.(Laughter)It's probably why I'm a little bit panicked right now --other than all the caffeine that I've had and the sugar --but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur.Attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder.Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease?Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.All three of the founders of Netscape had it.I could go on and on.Kids -- you can see these signs in kids.And what we're doing is we're giving them Ritalin and saying,"Don't be an entrepreneurial type.Fit into this other system and try to become a student."Sorry, entrepreneurs aren't students.We fast-track. We figure out the game.I stole essays. I cheated on exams.I hired kids to do my accounting assignments in universityfor 13 consecutive assignments.But as an entrepreneur you don't do accounting, you hire accountants.So I just figured that out earlier.(Laughter)(Applause)At least I can admit I cheated in university; most of you won't.I'm also quoted -- and I told the person who wrote the textbook --I'm now quoted in that exact same university textbookin every Canadian university and college studies.In managerial accounting, I'm chapter eight.I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting.And I told the author, after they did my interview, that I cheated in that same course.And she thought it was too funny to not include it anyway.But kids, you can see these signs in them.The definition of an entrepreneur is "a person who organizes, operatesand assumes the risk of a business venture."That doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program.It doesn't mean you have to get through school.It just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut.And we've heard those things about "is it nurture or is it nature," right?Is it thing one or thing two? What is it?Well, I don't think it's either. I think it can be both.I was groomed as an entrepreneur.When I was growing up as a young kid, I had no choice,because I was taught at a very early, young age --when my dad realized I wasn't going to fit intoeverything else that was being taught to me in school --that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age.He groomed us, the three of us,to hate the thought of having a joband to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people.My first little business venture: I was seven years old, I was in Winnipeg,and I was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords.And I was calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipegto find out how much would the dry cleanerspay me for coat hangers.And my mom came into the room and she said,"Where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners?"And I said, "Let's go and look in the basement."And we went down to the basement. And I opened up this cupboard.And there was about a thousand coat hangers that I'd collected.Because, when I told her I was going out to play with the kids,I was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangersto put in the basement to sell.Because I saw her a few weeks before that --you could get paid. They used to pay you two cents per coat hanger.So I was just like, well there's all kinds of coat hangers.And so I'll just go get them.And I knew she wouldn't want me to go get them, so I just did it anyway.And I learned that you could actually negotiate with people.This one person offered me three cents and I got him up to three and a half.I even knew at a seven-year-old agethat I could actually get a fractional percent of a cent,and people would pay that because it multiplied up.At seven years old I figured it out. I got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers.I sold license plate protectors door to door.My dad actually made me go find someonewho would sell me these things at wholesale.And at nine years old, I walked around in the city of Sudburyselling license plate protectors door to door to houses.And I remember this one customer so vividlybecause I also did some other stuff with these clients.I sold newspapers.And he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me ever.But I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license plate protector.And he's like, "Well, we don't need one."And I said, "But you've got two cars ..." -- I'm nine years old.I'm like, "But you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors."And he said, "I know."And I said, "This car here's got one license plate that's all crumpled up."And he said, "Yes, that's my wife's car." And I said, "Why don't we just test oneon the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer."So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each.If I couldn't sell all four, I could at least get one.I learned that at a young age.I did comic book arbitrage.When I was about 10 years old, I sold comic booksout of our cottage on Georgian Bay.And I would go biking up to the end of the beachand buy all the comics from the poor kids.And then I would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids.But it was obvious to me, right? Buy low, sell high.You've got this demand over here that has money.Don't try to sell to the poor kids; they don't have cash. The rich people do. Go get some.So that's obvious, right.It's like a recession. So, there's a recession.There's still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the U.S. economy.Go get some of that. And I learned that at a young age.I also learned, don't reveal your source,because I got beat up after about four weeks of doing thisbecause one of the rich kids found out where I was buying my comics from,and he didn't like the fact that he was paying a lot more.I was forced to get a paper route at 10 years old.I didn't really want a paper route,but at 10, my dad said, "That's going to be your next business."So not only would he get me one, but I had to get two,and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers,which I did, and then I realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money.So I would collect the tips and get payment.So I would go and collect for all the papers.He could just deliver them.Because then I realized I could make the money.By this point, I was definitely not going to be an employee.(Laughter)My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop.He had all these old automotive parts lying around.They had this old brass and copper.I asked him what he did with it, and he said he just throws it out.I said, "But wouldn't somebody pay you for that?" And he goes, "Maybe."Remember at 10 years old -- so 34 years agoI saw opportunity in this stuff.I saw there was money in garbage.And I was actually collecting it from all the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle.And then my dad would drive me on Saturdaysto a scrap metal recycler where I got paid.And I thought that was kind of cool.Strangely enough, 30 years later, we're building 1-800-GOT-JUNK?and making money off that too.I built these little pincushions when I was 11 years old in Cubs,and we made these pin cushions for our moms for Mother's Day.And you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins --when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside.And you'd make these chairs.And I had these little pillows that I would sew up.And you could stuff pins in them.Because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion.But what I realized was that you had to have options.So I actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown.And then when I went to the door, it wasn't, "Do you want to buy one?"It was, "Which color would you like?"Like I'm 10 years old; you're not going to say no to me,especially if you have two options -- you have the brown one or the clear one.So I learned that lesson at a young age.I learned that manual labor really sucks.Right, like cutting lawns is brutal.But because I had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that,I realized that recurring revenuefrom one client is amazing.That if I land this client once,and every week I get paid by that person,that's way better than trying to sellone clothespin thing to one person.Because you can't sell them more.So I love that recurring revenue model I started to learn at a young age.Remember, I was being groomed to do this. I was not allowed to have jobs.I would caddy, I would go to the golf course and caddy for people.But I realized that there was this one hill on our golf course,the 13th hole that had this huge hill.And people could never get their bags up it.So I would sit there with a lawn chairand just carry up all the people who didn't have caddies.I would carry their golf bags up to the top, and they'd pay me a dollar.Meanwhile, my friends were working for five hoursto haul some guy's bag around and get paid 10 bucks.I'm like, "That's stupid because you have to work for five hours.That doesn't make any sense." You just figure out a way to make more money faster.Every week, I would go to the corner store and buy all these pops.Then I would go up and deliver them to these 70-year-old women playing bridge.And they'd give me their orders for the following week.And then I'd just deliver pop and I'd just charge twice.And I had this captured market. You didn't need contracts.You just needed to have a supply and demandand this audience who bought into you.These women weren't going to go to anybody elsebecause they liked me, and I kind of figured it out.I went and got golf balls from golf courses.But everybody else was looking in the bushand looking in the ditches for golf balls.I'm like, screw that. They're all in the pondand nobody's going into the pond.So I would go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes.You just pick them up with both feet.You can't do it on stage.You get the golf balls, and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunksand when you're done you've got a couple hundred of them.But the problem is that people all didn't want all the golf balls.So I just packaged them. I'm like 12, right?I packaged them up three ways.I had the Pinnacles and DDHs and the really cool ones back then.Those sold for two dollars each.And then I had all the good ones that didn't look crappy. They were 50 cents each.And then I'd sell 50 at a time of all the crappy ones.And they could use those for practice balls.I sold sunglasses, when I was in school,to all the kids in high school.This is what really kind of gets everybody hating youis because you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time.But it paid the bills.So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.Then when the school shut me down --the school actually called me into the office and told me I couldn't do it --so I went to the gas stations andI sold lots of them to the gas stationsand had the gas stations sell them to their customers.That was cool because then I had retail outlets.And I think I was 14.Then I paid my entire way through first year university at Carltonby selling wine skins door to door.You know that you can hold a 40-ounce bottle of rumand two bottles of coke in a wineskin? So what, right?Yeah, but you know what? You stuff that down your shorts,when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free,everybody bought them.Supply, demand, big opportunity.I also branded it, so I sold them for five times the normal cost.It had our university logo on it.You know we teach our kids and we buy them games,but why don't we get them games, if they're entrepreneurial kids,that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs?Why don't you teach them not to waste money?I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in Banff, Albertabecause I'd thrown a penny out in the street,and my dad said, "Go pick it up."He said, "I work too damn hard for my money. I'm not going to see you ever waste a penny."And I remember that lesson to this day.Allowances teach kids the wrong habits.Allowances, by nature, are teaching kidsto think about a job.An entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck.Allowance is breeding kids at a young ageto expect a regular paycheck.That's wrong, for me, if you want to raise entrepreneurs.What I do with my kids now -- I've got two, nine and seven --is I teach them to walk around the house and the yard,looking for stuff that needs to get done.Come to me and tell me what it is.Or I'll come to them and say, "Here's what I need done."And then you know what we do? We negotiate.They go around looking for what it is.But then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid.And then they don't have a regular check, but they have more opportunities to find more stuff,and they learn the skill of negotiating,and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well.You breed that kind of stuff. Each of my kids has two piggy banks.Fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted,50 percent goes in their house account,50 percent goes in their toy account.Anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want.The 50 percent that goes in their house account, every six months, goes to the bank.They walk up with me. Every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker.Both my nine- and seven-year-olds have a stock broker already.But I'm teaching them to force that savings habit.It drives me crazy that 30-year-olds are saying,"Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now."Shit, you've missed 25 years.You can teach those habits to young kidswhen they don't even feel the pain yet.Don't read them bedtime stories every night.Maybe four nights out of the week read them bedtime storiesand three nights of the week have them tell stories.Why don't you sit down with kids and give them four items,a red shirt, a blue tie, a kangaroo and a laptop,and have them tell a story about those four things?My kids do that all the time.It teaches them to sell; it teaches them creativity;it teaches them to think on their feet.Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it.Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk,even if it's just stand up in front of their friendsand do plays and have speeches.Those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing.Show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like.Show them the grumpy employees.When you see grumpy customer service, point that out to them.Say, "By the way, that guy's a crappy employee."And say, "These ones are good ones."(Laughter)If you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service,show them what bad customer service looks like.(Laughter)We have all these lessons in front of us,but we don't take those opportunities; we teach kids to go get a tutor.Imagine if you actually tookall the kids' junk that's in the house right now,all the toys that they've outgrown two years agoand said, "Why don't we start selling some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?"And they can actually sell itand learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in.They can come into your account or a sub account or whatever.But teach them how to fix the price, guess the price,pull up the photos.Teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money.Then the money they get, 50 percent goes in their house account,50 percent goes in their toy account.My kids love this stuff.Some of the entrepreneurial traits that you've got to nurture in kids:attainment, tenacity, leadership, introspection, interdependence, values.All these traits you can find in young kids, and you can help nurture them.Look for that kind of stuff.There's two traits that I want you to also look out forthat we don't kind of get out of their system.Don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorderunless it is really, really freaking bad.(Applause)The same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression,unless it is so clinically brutal, man.Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease.When Steve Jurvetson and Jim Clarkand Jim Barksdale have all got it,and they built Netscape --imagine if they were given Ritalin.We wouldn't have have that stuff, right?Al Gore really would have had to invented the Internet.(Laughter)These skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroomas well as everything else.I'm not saying don't get kids to want to be lawyers.But how about getting entrepreneurshipto be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well?Because there's huge opportunities in that.I want to close with a quick little video.It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor.These guys, Grasshopper.It's about kids. It's about entrepreneurship.Hopefully this inspires you to take what you've heard from meand do something with it to change the world.[Kid ... "And you thought you could do anything?"][You still can.][Because a lot of what we consider impossible ...][... is easy to overcome][Because in case you haven't noticed, we live in a place where][One individual can make a difference][Want proof?][Just look at the people who built our country;][Our parents, grandparents, our aunts, uncles ...][They were immigrants, newcomers ready to make their mark][Maybe they came with very little][Or perhaps they didn't own anything except for ...][... a single brilliant idea][These people were thinkers, doers ...][... innovators ...][... until they came up with the name ...][... entrepreneurs!][They change the way we think about what is possible.][They have a clear vision of how life can be better][for all of us, even when times are tough.][Right now, it's hard to see ...][... when our view is cluttered with obstacles.][But turbulence creates opportunities][for success, achievement, and pushes us ...][to discover new ways of doing things][So what opportunities will you go after and why?][If you're an entrepreneur][you know that risk isn't the reward.][No. The rewards are driving innovation ...][... changing people's lives.

So, if you're in the audience today,or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place,you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem.Whether you're an artist, a technologist,a lawyer or a fan,the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.Rights management is no longersimply a question of ownership,it's a complex web of relationshipsand a critical part of our cultural landscape.YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners,but in order to give them choices about what they can dowith copies, mashups and more,we need to first identifywhen copyrighted material is uploaded to our site.Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works.Two years ago, recording artist Chris Brownreleased the official video of his single "Forever."A fan saw it on TV,recorded it with her camera phone,and uploaded it to YouTube.Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's videoin our Content ID system,within seconds of attempting to upload the video,the copy was detected,giving Sony the choice of what to do next.But how do we know that the user's video was a copy?Well, it starts with content ownersdelivering assets into our database,along with a usage policythat tells us what to do when we find a match.We compare each uploadagainst all of the reference files in our database.This heat map is going to show youhow the brain of the system works.Here we can see the original reference filebeing compared to the user generated content.The system compares every momentof one to the other to see if there's a match.This means that we can identify a matcheven if the copy used is just a portion of the original file,plays it in slow motionand has degraded audio and video quality.And we do this every timethat a video is uploaded to YouTube.And that's over 20 hours of video every minute.When we find a match,we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down.And the scale and the speed of this systemis truly breathtaking.We're not just talking about a few videos,we're talking about over100 years of video every day,between new uploads and the legacy scanswe regularly do across all of the content on the site.When we compare those hundred years of video,we're comparing it against millionsof reference files in our database.It would be like 36,000 peoplestaring at 36,000 monitorseach and every day, without so much as a coffee break.Now, what do we do when we find a match?Well, most rights owners, instead of blocking,will allow the copy to be published.And then they benefit through the exposure,advertising and linked sales.Remember Chris Brown's video "Forever"?Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts,and that looked like the end of the story,but sometime last year, a young couple got married.This is their wedding video.You may have seen it.(Music)What's amazing about this is,if the processional of the wedding was this much fun,can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been?I mean, who are these people?I totally want to go to that wedding.So their little wedding video went onto get over 40 million views.And instead of Sony blocking,they allowed the upload to occur.And they put advertising against itand linked from it to iTunes.And the song, 18 months old,went back to number four on the iTunes charts.So Sony is generating revenue from both of these.And Jill and Kevin, the happy couple,they came back from their honeymoonand found that their video had gone crazy viral.And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows,and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference.The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donationsto end domestic violence.The "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popularthat NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office,"which just goes to show,it's truly an ecosystem of culture.Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios,but sometimes big studios borrowing back.By empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity.And all it took to change things aroundwas to allow for choice through rights identification.So why has no one ever solved this problem before?It's because it's a big problem,and it's complicated and messy.It's not uncommon for a single videoto have multiple rights owners.There's musical labels.There's multiple music publishers.And each of these can vary by country.There's lots of caseswhere we have more than one work mashed together.So we have to manage many claimsto the same video.YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases.But the system only works throughthe participation of rights owners.If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube,you should register in the Content ID system,and then you'll have the choiceabout how your content is used.And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content.By simply blocking all reuse,you'll miss out on new art forms,new audiences,new distribution channelsand new revenue streams.But it's not just about dollars and impressions.Just look at all the joythat was spread through progressive rights managementand new technology.And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading.Thank you.(Applause)

I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.She's an Italian fashion designer.She goes to this vintage store in Pariswith a friend of hers.She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga --she loves it.She's turning it inside out.She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction.Her friend says, "Buy it already."She said, "I'll buy it, but I'm also going to replicate it."Now, the academics in this audience may think,"Well, that sounds like plagiarism."But to a fashionista, what it really isis a sign of Prada's genius:that she can root through the history of fashionand pick the one jacketthat doesn't need to be changed by one iota,and to be current and to be now.You might also be asking whether it's possiblethat this is illegal for her to do this.Well, it turns out that it's actually not illegal.In the fashion industry, there's very littleintellectual property protection.They have trademark protection,but no copyright protectionand no patent protection to speak of.All they have, really, is trademark protection,and so it means that anybodycould copy any garmenton any person in this roomand sell it as their own design.The only thing that they can't copyis the actual trademark labelwithin that piece of apparel.That's one reason that you see logossplattered all over these products.It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artiststo knock off these designsbecause they can't knock off the logo.But if you go to Santee Alley, yeah.(Laughter) Well, yeah.Canal Street, I know.And sometimes these are fun, right?Now, the reason for this, the reason that the fashion industrydoesn't have any copyright protectionis because the courts decided long agothat apparel is too utilitarianto qualify for copyright protection.They didn't want a handful of designersowning the seminal building blocks of our clothing.And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleevebecause Joe Blow owns it.But too utilitarian? I mean is that the way you think of fashion?This is Vivienne Westwood. No!We think of it as maybe too silly,too unnecessary.Now, those of you who are familiar with the logicbehind copyright protection --which is that without ownership, there is no incentive to innovate --might be really surprisedby both the critical success of the fashion industryand the economic success of this industry.What I'm going to argue today is thatbecause there's no copyright protectionin the fashion industry,fashion designers have actually been able to elevateutilitarian design,things to cover our naked bodies,into something that we consider art.Because there's no copyright protectionin this industry,there's a very open and creativeecology of creativity.Unlike their creative brothers and sisters,who are sculptors or photographersor filmmakers or musicians,fashion designers can samplefrom all their peers' designs.They can take any element from any garmentfrom the history of fashionand incorporate it into their own design.They're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist.And here, I suspect,they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar.Maybe just a little.Can't copyright a costume either.Now, fashion designers havethe broadest palette imaginablein this creative industry.This wedding dress hereis actually made of sporks,and this dress is actually made of aluminum.I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimesas they walk through.So, one of the magical side effectsof having a culture of copying,which is really what it is,is the establishment of trends.People think this is a magical thing. How does it happen?Well, it's because it's legal for people to copy one another.Some people believe thatthere are a few people at the top of the fashion food chainwho sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear,but if you talk to any designer at any level,including these high-end designers,they always saytheir main inspiration comes from the street:where people like you and me remix and matchour own fashion looks.And that's where they really get a lot of theircreative inspiration,so it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry.Now, the fast fashion giants haveprobably benefited the mostfrom the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry.They are notorious for knocking off high-end designsand selling them at very low prices.And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits,but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers.The courts have said over and over again, "You don't needany more intellectual property protection."When you look at copies like this,you wonder: How do the luxury high-end brandsremain in business?If you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand?Well, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago.We invited Tom Ford to come --the conference was called, "Ready to Share:Fashion and the Ownership of Creativity" --and we asked him exactly this question.Here's what he had to say.He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci,in case you didn't know.Tom Ford: And we found after much researchthat -- actually not much research, quite simple research --that the counterfeit customer was not our customer.Johanna Blakley: Imagine that.The people on Santee Alleyare not the ones who shop at Gucci.(Laughter)This is a very different demographic.And, you know, a knock-off is never the sameas an original high-end design,at least in terms of the materials; they're always made of cheaper materials.But even sometimes a cheaper versioncan actually have some charming aspects,can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend.There's lots of virtues of copying.One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed tois that we now havea much broader paletteof design choices to choose from than we ever have before,and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry, actually.And this is a good thing. We need lots of options.Fashion, whether you like it or not,helps you project who you are to the world.Because of fast fashion,global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to.And this, actually, is good news to trendsetters;they want trends to be setso that they can move product.For fashionistas,they want to stay ahead of the curve.They don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing.And so, they want to move on to the next trendas soon as possible.I tell you, there is no rest for the fashionable.Every season, these designers have to struggleto come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love.And this, let me tell you,is very good for the bottom line.Now of course, there's a bunch of effectsthat this culture of copying hason the creative process.And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer.He has complained a lot about people copying him,but in one interview I read,he said it has really forced him to up his game.He had to come up with new ideas,new things that would be hard to copy.He came up with this Bowden-wedge heelthat has to be made out of steel or titanium;if you make it from some sort of cheaper material,it'll actually crack in two.It forced him to be a little more innovative. (Music)And that actually reminded meof jazz great, Charlie Parker.I don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have.He said that one of the reasons he invented bebopwas that he was pretty surethat white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound. (Laughter)He wanted to make it too difficult to copy,and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time.They're trying to put togethera signature look, an aestheticthat reflects who they are.When people knock it off, everybody knowsbecause they've put that look out on the runway,and it's a coherent aesthetic.I love these Gallianos.Okay, we'll move on. (Laughter)This is not unlike the world of comedy.I don't know if you know that jokesalso can't be copyright protected.So when one-liners were really popular,everybody stole them from one another.But now, we have a different kind of comic.They develop a persona,a signature style, much like fashion designers.And their jokes,much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer,really only work within that aesthetic.If somebody steals a jokefrom Larry David, for instance,it's not as funny.Now, the other thing that fashion designers have doneto survive in this culture of copyingis they've learned how to copy themselves.They knock themselves off.They make deals with the fast fashion giantsand they come up with a way to sell their productto a whole new demographic:the Santee Alley demographic.Now, some fashion designers will say,"It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect.In other countries there is protectionfor our artful designs."But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world,it turns out that the protection that's offeredis really ineffectual.In Japan, for instance, which I think is the third largest market,they have a design law; it protects apparel,but the novelty standard is so high,you have to prove that your garment has never existed before,it's totally unique.And that's sort of likethe novelty standard for a U.S. patent,which fashion designers never get --rarely get here in the states.In the European Union, they went in the other direction.Very low novelty standard,anybody can register anything.But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industryand you have a lot of luxury designers there,they don't register their garments, generally,and there's not a lot of litigation.It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low.A person can come in and take somebody else's gown,cut off three inches from the bottom,go to the E.U. and register it as a new, original design.So, that does not stop the knock-off artists.If you look at the registry, actually,a lot of the registered things in the E.U.are Nike T-shirtsthat are almost identical to one another.But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg.She is the head ofthe Council of Fashion Designers of America,and she has told her constituency thatshe is going to get copyright protectionfor fashion designs.The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though.I don't think the legislation is going anywhere,because they realized it is so hardto tell the difference between a pirated designand something that's just part of a global trend.Who owns a look?That is a very difficult question to answer.It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time,and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive.You know, it's not just the fashion industrythat doesn't have copyright protection.There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection,including the food industry.You cannot copyright a recipebecause it's a set of instructions, it's fact,and you cannot copyright the look and feelof even the most unique dish.Same with automobiles.It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look,you cannot copyright the sculptural design.It's a utilitarian article, that's why.Same with furniture,it's too utilitarian.Magic tricks, I think they're instructions, sort of like recipes:no copyright protection.Hairdos, no copyright protection.Open source software, these guys decidedthey didn't want copyright protection.They thought it'd be more innovative without it.It's really hard to get copyright for databases.Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.They share their designs.Jokes, no copyright protection.Fireworks displays,the rules of games,the smell of perfume: no.And some of these industries may seemsort of marginal to you,but these are the gross salesfor low I.P. industries,industries with very little copyright protection,and there's the gross sales offilms and books.(Applause)It ain't pretty.(Applause)So you talk to people in the fashion industryand they're like, "Shhh!Don't tell anybodywe can actually steal from each other's designs.It's embarrassing."But you know what? It's revolutionary,and it's a model that a lot of other industries --like the ones we just saw with the really small bars --they might have to think about this.Because right now, those industries with a lot of copyright protectionare operating in an atmospherewhere it's as if they don't have any protection,and they don't know what to do.When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industriesthat didn't have copyright protection,I thought, "What exactly is the underlying logic?I want a picture." And the lawyers do not provide a picture,so I made one.These are the two mainsort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law.It is more complex than this, but this will do.First: Is something an artistic object?Then it deserves protection.Is it a utilitarian object?Then no, it does not deserve protection.This is a difficult, unstable binary.The other one is: Is it an idea?Is it something that needs tofreely circulate in a free society?No protection.Or is it a physically fixedexpression of an idea:something that somebody madeand they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it?The problem is that digital technologyhas completely subverted the logicof this physically fixed, expressionversus idea concept.Nowadays,we don't really recognize a bookas something that sits on our shelfor music as something that isa physical object that we can hold.It's a digital file.It is barely tethered to any sort ofphysical reality in our minds.And these things, because we can copy and transmit them so easily,actually circulate within our culturea lot more like ideasthan like physically instantiated objects.Now, the conceptual issues are truly profoundwhen you talk about creativityand ownershipand, let me tell you, we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out.They're smart.I'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay.He's smart, he's smart.But you want an interdisciplinary team of peoplehashing this out,trying to figure out: What is the kind of ownership model,in a digital world,that's going to lead to the most innovation?And my suggestion is thatfashion might be a really good placeto start looking for a modelfor creative industries in the future.If you want more information about this research project,please visit our website: it's ReadyToShare.org.And I really want to thank Veronica Jauriquifor making this very fashionable presentation.Thank you so much.

We're here today to announcethe first synthetic cell,a cell made bystarting with the digital code in the computer,building the chromosomefrom four bottles of chemicals,assembling that chromosome in yeast,transplanting it intoa recipient bacterial celland transforming that cellinto a new bacterial species.So this is the first self-replicating speciesthat we've had on the planetwhose parent is a computer.It also is the first speciesto have its own websiteencoded in its genetic code.But we'll talk more aboutthe watermarks in a minute.This is a project that had its inception15 years agowhen our team then --we called the institute TIGR --was involved in sequencingthe first two genomes in history.We did Haemophilus influenzaeand then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism,that of Mycoplasma genitalium.And as soon aswe had these two sequenceswe thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genomeof a self-replicating species,could there be even a smaller genome?Could we understand the basis of cellular lifeat the genetic level?It's been a 15-year questjust to get to the starting point nowto be able to answer those questions,because it's very difficult to eliminatemultiple genes from a cell.You can only do them one at a time.We decided early onthat we had to take a synthetic route,even though nobody had been there before,to see if we could synthesizea bacterial chromosomeso we could actually vary the gene contentto understand the essential genes for life.That started our 15-year questto get here.But before we did the first experiments,we actually askedArt Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvaniato undertake a reviewof what the risks, the challenges,the ethics around creating newspecies in the laboratory werebecause it hadn't been done before.They spent about two yearsreviewing that independentlyand published their results in Science in 1999.Ham and I took two years offas a side project to sequence the human genome,but as soon as that was donewe got back to the task at hand.In 2002, we starteda new institute,the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives,where we set out two goals:One, to understandthe impact of our technology on the environment,and how to understand the environment better,and two, to start down this processof making synthetic lifeto understand basic life.In 2003,we published our first success.So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchisondeveloped some new methodsfor making error-free DNAat a small level.Our first task wasa 5,000-letter code bacteriophage,a virus that attacks only E. coli.So that wasthe phage phi X 174,which was chosen for historical reasons.It was the first DNA phage,DNA virus, DNA genomethat was actually sequenced.So once we realizedthat we could make 5,000-base pairviral-sized pieces,we thought, we at least have the meansthen to try and make serially lots of these piecesto be able to eventually assemble them togetherto make this mega base chromosome.So, substantially larger thanwe even thought we would go initially.There were several steps to this. There were two sides:We had to solve the chemistryfor making large DNA molecules,and we had to solve the biological sideof how, if we had this new chemical entity,how would we boot it up, activate itin a recipient cell.We had two teams working in parallel:one team on the chemistry,and the other on trying tobe able to transplantentire chromosomesto get new cells.When we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem,which is why we chose the smallest genome.And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genometo a much larger one.And we can walk through the reasons for that,but basically the small celltook on the order ofone to two months to get results from,whereas the larger, faster-growing celltakes only two days.So there's only so many cycles we could go throughin a year at six weeks per cycle.And you should know that basically99, probably 99 percent plusof our experiments failed.So this was a debugging,problem-solving scenario from the beginningbecause there was no recipeof how to get there.So, one of the most important publications we hadwas in 2007.Carole Lartigue led the effortto actually transplant a bacterial chromosomefrom one bacteria to another.I think philosophically, that was one of the most important papersthat we've ever donebecause it showed how dynamic life was.And we knew, once that worked,that we actually had a chanceif we could make the synthetic chromosomesto do the same with those.We didn't know that it was going to take usseveral years more to get there.In 2008,we reported the complete synthesisof the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome.We think in part, because of its slow growthand, in part,cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanismsto keep these events from happening.It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant intohad a nuclease, an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface,and was happy to eatthe synthetic DNA that we gave itand never got transplantations.But at the time, that was the largestmolecule of a defined structurethat had been made.And so both sides were progressing,but part of the synthesishad to be accomplished or was able to be accomplishedusing yeast, putting the fragments in yeastand yeast would assemble these for us.It's an amazing step forward,but we had a problem because now we hadthe bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.So in addition to doing the transplant,we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosomeout of the eukaryotic yeastinto a form where we could transplant itinto a recipient cell.So our team developed new techniquesfor actually growing, cloningentire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.So we took the same mycoides genomethat Carole had initially transplanted,and we grew that in yeastas an artificial chromosome.And we thought this would be a great test bedfor learning how to get chromosomes out of yeastand transplant them.When we did these experiments, though,we could get the chromosome out of yeastbut it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.That little issue took the team two years to solve.It turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cellwas actually methylated,and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme,from digesting the DNA.So what we found is if we took the chromosomeout of yeast and methylated it,we could then transplant it.Further advances camewhen the team removed the restriction enzyme genesfrom the recipient capricolum cell.And once we had done that, now we can takenaked DNA out of yeast and transplant it.So last fallwhen we published the results of that work in Science,we all became overconfidentand were sure we were onlya few weeks awayfrom being able to now boot upa chromosome out of yeast.Because of the problems withMycoplasma genitalium and its slow growthabout a year and a half ago,we decided to synthesizethe much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome,knowing that we had the biology worked out on thatfor transplantation.And Dan led the team for the synthesisof this over one-million-base pair chromosome.But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end,and it set us back three monthsbecause we had one errorout of over a million base pairs in that sequence.So the team developed new debugging software,where we could test each synthetic fragmentto see if it would grow in a backgroundof wild type DNA.And we found that 10 out of the 11100,000-base pair pieces we synthesizedwere completely accurateand compatible witha life-forming sequence.We narrowed it down to one fragment;we sequenced itand found just one base pair had been deletedin an essential gene.So accuracy is essential.There's parts of the genomewhere it cannot tolerate even a single error,and then there's parts of the genomewhere we can put in large blocks of DNA,as we did with the watermarks,and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.So it took about three months to find that errorand repair it.And then early one morning, at 6 a.m.we got a text from Dansaying that, now, the first blue colonies existed.So, it's been a long route to get here:15 years from the beginning.We feltone of the tenets of this fieldwas to make absolutely certainwe could distinguish synthetic DNAfrom natural DNA.Early on, when you're working in a new area of science,you have to think about all the pitfallsand things that could lead youto believe that you had done something when you hadn't,and, even worse, leading others to believe it.So, we thought the worst problem would bea single molecule contaminationof the native chromosome,leading us to believe that we actually hadcreated a synthetic cell,when it would have been just a contaminant.So early on, we developed the notionof putting in watermarks in the DNAto absolutely make clearthat the DNA was synthetic.And the first chromosome we builtin 2008 --the 500,000-base pair one --we simply assignedthe names of the authors of the chromosomeinto the genetic code,but it was using just amino acidsingle letter translations,which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.So the team actually developed a new codewithin the code within the code.So it's a new codefor interpreting and writing messages in DNA.Now, mathematicians have been hiding and writingmessages in the genetic code for a long time,but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologistsbecause, if you write long messageswith the code that the mathematicians developed,it would more than likely lead tonew proteins being synthesizedwith unknown functions.So the code that Mike Montague and the team developedactually puts frequent stop codons,so it's a different alphabetbut allows us to usethe entire English alphabetwith punctuation and numbers.So, there are four major watermarksall over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.The first one actually contains within itthis code for interpretingthe rest of the genetic code.So in the remaining information,in the watermarks,contain the names of, I think it's46 different authorsand key contributorsto getting the project to this stage.And we also built ina website addressso that if somebody decodes the codewithin the code within the code,they can send an email to that address.So it's clearly distinguishablefrom any other species,having 46 names in it,its own web address.And we added three quotations,because with the first genomewe were criticized for not trying to say something more profoundthan just signing the work.So we won't give the rest of the code,but we will give the three quotations.The first is,"To live, to err,to fall, to triumphand to recreate life out of life."It's a James Joyce quote.The second quotation is, "See things not as they are,but as they might be."It's a quote from the "American Prometheus"book on Robert Oppenheimer.And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote:"What I cannot build,I cannot understand."So, because this is as much a philosophical advanceas a technical advance in science,we tried to deal with both the philosophicaland the technical side.The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questionsis that the extensive workthat we've done --asking for ethical review,pushing the envelopeon that side as well as the technical side --this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community,in the policy communityand at the highest levels of the federal government.Even with this announcement,as we did in 2003 --that work was funded by the Department of Energy,so the work was reviewedat the level of the White House,trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it.And they came down on the side of open publication,which is the right approach --we've briefed the White House,we've briefed members of Congress,we've tried to take and pushthe policy issuesin parallel with the scientific advances.So with that, I would liketo open it first to the floor for questions.Yes, in the back.Reporter: Could you explain, in layman's terms,how significant a breakthrough this is please?Craig Venter: Can we explain how significant this is?I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.It's significant to us.Perhaps it's a giant philosophical changein how we view life.We actually view it as a baby step in terms of,it's taken us 15 years to be ableto do the experimentwe wanted to do 15 years agoon understanding life at its basic level.But we actually believethis is going to be a very powerful set of toolsand we're already startingin numerous avenuesto use this tool.We have, at the Institute,ongoing funding now from NIHin a program with Novartisto try and use these newsynthetic DNA toolsto perhaps make the flu vaccinethat you might get next year.Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these,Dan's team can now make thesein less than 24 hours.So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out,we think we can shorten that processquite substantially.In the vaccine area,Synthetic Genomics and the Instituteare forming a new vaccine companybecause we think these tools can affect vaccinesto diseases that haven't been possible to date,things where the viruses rapidly evolve,such with rhinovirus.Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds?Or, more importantly, HIV,where the virus evolves so quicklythe vaccines that are made todaycan't keep upwith those evolutionary changes.Also, at Synthetic Genomics,we've been workingon major environmental issues.I think this latest oil spill in the Gulfis a reminder.We can't see CO2 --we depend on scientific measurements for itand we see the beginning resultsof having too much of it --but we can see pre-CO2 nowfloating on the watersand contaminating the beaches in the Gulf.We need some alternativesfor oil.We have a program with Exxon Mobileto try and develop new strains of algaethat can efficiently capture carbon dioxidefrom the atmosphere or from concentrated sources,make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineriesto make normal gasolineand diesel fuel out of CO2.Those are just a couple of the approachesand directions that we're taking.(Applause)

Or better, how do you explainFor example:Why is Apple so innovative?Year after year, after year,And yet, they're just a computer company.They're just like everyone else.the same agencies,the same consultants, the same media.Why him?And why is it that the Wright brotherswhen there were certainly other teamsand the Wright brothers beat them to it.There's something else at play here.As it turns out, there's a pattern.All I did was codify it,I call it the golden circle.Why? How? What?This little idea explainsLet me define the terms really quickly.knows what they do, 100 percent.Some know how they do it,or your proprietary process or your USP.That's a result. It's always a result.By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?What's your cause? What's your belief?Why does your organization exist?Why do you get out of bed in the morning?And why should anyone care?As a result, the way we think, we act,Let me give you an example.If Apple were like everyone else,"We make great computers.Want to buy one?""Meh."That's how most of us communicate.that's how we communicate interpersonally.We say what we do,we say how we're different or betterand we expect some sort of a behavior,a purchase, a vote, something like that.Here's our new law firm:we always perform for our clients.Here's our new car:Buy our car.But it's uninspiring.Here's how Apple actually communicates.We believe in thinking differently.The way we challenge the status quosimple to use and user friendly.We just happen to make great computers.Want to buy one?"Totally different, right?You're ready to buy a computer from me.people buy why you do it.But we're also perfectly comfortableor a DVR from Apple.In fact, they tried.Nobody bought one.Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,and they make great quality products,and nobody bought one.buying an MP3 player from Dell.But we do it every day.Here's the best part:Not psychology, biology.into three major componentsOur newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,our neocortex,corresponds with the "what" level.The neocortex is responsiblelike trust and loyalty.all decision-making,and it has no capacity for language.It just doesn't drive behavior.that controls behavior,This is where gut decisions come from.but it just doesn't feel right."doesn't control language.The best we can muster up is,controlling your behavior.then how will you ever get peopleor, more importantly, be loyalI always say that, you know,but if they believe what you believe,And back in the early 20th century,Everybody was trying it.to be the recipe for success.Even now, you ask people,of the same three things:Samuel Pierpont Langleyto figure out this flying machine.Money was no problem.He held a seat at Harvardhe knew all the big minds of the day.He hired the best minds money could findand the market conditions were fantastic.and everyone was rooting for Langley.A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio,Orville and Wilbur Wright,They had no money;had a college education,not even Orville or Wilbur;The difference was,it'll change the course of the world.Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.He was in pursuit of the result.He was in pursuit of the riches.And lo and behold, look what happened.The others just worked for the paycheck.And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,the Wright brothers took flight,We found out about it a few days later.The day the Wright brothers took flight,he quit.He could have said,"That's an amazing discovery, guys,If you talk about what you believe,The next 34% are your early majority,your late majority and your laggards.(Laughter)and then the system tips.We all have about 10% who just "get it."That's how we describe them, right?until someone else has tried it first.and not just what product is available.to buy an iPhone when they first came out,they did it for themselves.It's because they wanted to be first.stood in line for six hours,and how they wanted everybody to see them:They were first.So let me give you a famous example,First, the famous failure.It's a commercial example.As we said before, the recipe for successYou should have success then.Look at TiVo.to this current day,hands down, there is no dispute.They were extremely well-funded.Market conditions were fantastic.I mean, we use TiVo as verb.(Laughter)But TiVo's a commercial failure.They've never made money.And when they went IPO,their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollarsexcept for a couple of little spikes.they told us all what they had.without you even asking."And the cynical majority said,"We don't believe you.We don't need it. We don't like it.You're scaring us."What if they had said,over every aspect of your life,boy, do we have a product for you.It pauses live TV, skips commercials,memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."In the summer of 1963,to hear Dr. King speak.They sent out no invitations,How do you do that?who was a great orator.in a pre-civil rights America.In fact, some of his ideas were bad.But he had a gift.And people who believed what he believedto get the word out to even more people.How many of them showed up for him?Zero.They showed up for themselves.It's what they believed about America25% of the audience was white.will we live in a just world.not the "I have a plan" speech.(Laughter)They're not inspiring anybody.but those who lead inspire us.but because we want to.And it's those who start with "why"or find others who inspire them.Thank you very much.(Applause)

One of the things thatdefines a TEDsteris you've taken your passion,and you've turned it into stewardship.You actually put action to the issues you care about.But what you're going to find eventually isyou may need to actually get elected officialsto help you out.So, how do you do that?One of the things I should probably tell you is,I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,and that sort of warped my framework.So, when you start to think about politicians,you've got to realize these are strange creatures.Other than the fact that they can't tell directions,and they have very strange breeding habits,how do you actually work with these things? (Laughter)What we need to understand is:What drives the political creature?And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart:One is reputation and influence.These are the primary tools by whicha politician can do his job.The second one -- unlike most animals,which is survival of the species --this is preservation of self.Now you may think it's money,but that's actually sort of a proxyto what I can do to preserve myself.Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forwardis these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?You can send them an email.Well, unfortunately, I've got so manyViagra ads coming at me,your email is lost.It doesn't matter, it's spam.How about you get on the phone?Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone,"Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."That doesn't move.Face to face would work,but it's hard to set it up.It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.Yes, contributions actually do make a differenceand they set a context for having a conversation,but it takes some time to build up.So what actually works?And the answer is rather strange.It's a letter.We live in a digital world,but we're fairly analog creatures.Letters actually work.Even the top dog himselftakes time every day to read 10 lettersthat are picked out by staff.I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked withwill tell you about the letters they getand what they mean.So, how are you going to write your letter?First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.I know these are tough, and you may have a hard timegetting your hand bent around it, (Laughter)but this is actually critical.And it is critical thatyou actually handwrite your letter.It is so novel to see this,that somebody actually picked up an analog deviceand has written to me.Second of all, I'm going to recommend thatyou get into a proactive stanceand write to your elected officials at least once a month.Here's my promise to you:If you are consistent and do this,within three months the elected official will start calling youwhen that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"Now, I'm going to give youa four paragraph format to work with.Now, when you approach these animals,you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them,and you also need to approach themwith some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.So in paragraph number one,what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this:You appreciate them.You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else,but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.So, here you go. (Laughter)Paragraph number two:You may actually have to just get very bluntand say what's really on your mind.When you do this,don't attack people;you attack tactics.Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.Paragraph number three:When animals are attacked or cornered,they will fight to the death,so you have to give them an exit.Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it."Obviously, you're intelligent.If you had the right information,you would have done the right thing." (Laughter)Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.You're the safe place to come in to.So, in paragraph number four,you're going to tell people,"If no one is providing you with this information, let me help." (Laughter)Animals do displays. They do two things:They warn you or they try to attract youand say, "We need to mate."You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.You do a number of things: you're a vice president,you volunteer, you do something else.Why is is this important?Because this establishes the twoprimary criteria for the political creature:that you have influence in a large sphere,and that my preservation depends on you.Here is one very quick hack,especially for the feds in the audience.Here's how you mail your letter.First of all, you send the original to the district office.So, you send the copy to the main office.If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"Then some droid in the back puts the name on a ticklerand says, "Oh, this is an important letter."And you actually get into the folderthat the elected official actually has to read.So, what your letter means:I've got to tell you, we are all in a party,and political officials are the pinatas.(Laughter)We are harangued, lectured to,sold, marketed,but a letter is actually one of the few timesthat we have honest communication.I got this letter when I was first elected,and I still carry it toevery council meeting I go to.This is an opportunity at real dialogue,and if you have stewardshipand want to communicate,that dialogue is incredibly powerful.So when you do that, here's what I can promise:You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.Get writing.(Applause)

Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillmanintroduced a design challengecalled the marshmallow challenge.And the idea's pretty simple:Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structureout of 20 sticks of spaghetti,one yard of tape, one yard of stringand a marshmallow.The marshmallow has to be on top.And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hardbecause it forces peopleto collaborate very quickly.And so, I thought this was an interesting idea,and I incorporated it into a design workshop.And it was a huge success.And since then, I've conductedabout 70 design workshops across the worldwith students and designers and architects,even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,and there's something about this exercisethat reveals very deep lessonsabout the nature of collaboration,and I'd like to share some of them with you.So, normally, most people beginby orienting themselves to the task.They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,they jockey for power.Then they spend some time planning, organizing,they sketch and they lay out spaghetti.They spend the majority of their timeassembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.And then finally, just as they're running out of time,someone takes out the marshmallow,and then they gingerly put it on top,and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! --they admire their work.But what really happens, most of the time,is that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh,"because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structureto buckle and to collapse.So there are a number of peoplewho have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others,and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.(Laughter)They lie, they cheat, they get distractedand they produce really lame structures.And of course there are teamsthat have a lot more "ta-da" structures,and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.(Laughter)And it's pretty amazing.As Peter tells us,not only do they produce the tallest structures,but they're the most interesting structures of them all.So the question you want to ask is:How come? Why? What is it about them?And Peter likes to say thatnone of the kids spend any timetrying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?They don't spend time jockeying for power.But there's another reason as well.And the reason is that business students are trainedto find the single right plan, right?And then they execute on it.And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,they run out of time and what happens?It's a crisis.Sound familiar? Right.What kindergarteners do differentlyis that they start with the marshmallow,and they build prototypes, successive prototypes,always keeping the marshmallow on top,so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.Designers recognize this type of collaborationas the essence of the iterative process.And with each version, kids get instant feedbackabout what works and what doesn't work.So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,but let's look at how different teams perform.So the average for most people is around 20 inches;business schools students, about half of that;lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,kindergarteners, better than most adults.Who does the very best?Architects and engineers, thankfully.(Laughter)Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.And why is it? Because they understand trianglesand self-reinforcing geometrical patternsare the key to buildingstable structures.So CEOs, a little bit better than average,but here's where it gets interesting.If you put you put an executive admin. on the team,they get significantly better.(Laughter)It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win."You can just tell beforehand. And why is that?Because they have special skillsof facilitation.They manage the process, they understand the process.And any team who managesand pays close attention to workwill significantly improve the team's performance.Specialized skills and facilitation skillsare the combination that leads to strong success.If you have 10 teams that typically perform,you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.And I tried something interesting.I thought, let's up the ante, once.So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.So what do you think happened to these design students?What was the result?Here's what happened:Not one team had a standing structure.If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,they would have taken home the prize.So, isn't that interesting? That high stakeshave a strong impact.We did the exercise again with the same students.What do you think happened then?So now they understand the value of prototyping.So the same team went from being the very worstto being among the very best.They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.So there's deep lessons for usabout the nature of incentives and success.So, you might ask: Why would anyoneactually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?And the reason is, I help createdigital tools and processesto help teams build cars and video gamesand visual effects.And what the marshmallow challenge doesis it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.Because, frankly,every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it?The challenge provides a shared experience,a common language,a common stance to build the right prototype.And so, this is the value of the experience,of this so simple exercise.And those of you who are interestedmay want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.It's a blog that you can look athow to build the marshmallows.There's step-by-step instructions on this.There are crazy examples from around the worldof how people tweak and adjust the system.There's world records that are on this as well.And the fundamental lesson, I believe,is that design truly isa contact sport.It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,and that we apply the very best of our thinking,our feeling and our doingto the challenge that we have at hand.And sometimes, a little prototype of this experienceis all that it takes to turn usfrom an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment.And that can make a big difference.Thank you very much.(Applause)

First of all, I'm a geek.I'm an organic food-eating,carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.And I really want to build green,but I'm very suspiciousof all of these well-meaning articles,people long on moral authorityand short on data,telling me how to do these kinds of things.And so I have to figure this out for myself.For example: Is this evil?I have dropped a blob of organic yogurtfrom happy self-actualized local cowson my counter top,and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.But can I use a paper towel? (Laughter)The answer to this can be found in embodied energy.This is the amount of energy that goes intoany paper towel or embodied water,and every time I use a paper towel,I am using this muchvirtual energy and water.Wipe it up, throw it away.Now, if I compare that to a cotton towelthat I can use a thousand times,I don't have a whole lot of embodied energyuntil I wash that yogurty towel.This is now operating energy.So if I throw my towel in the washing machine,I've now put energy and waterback into that towel ...unless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, (Laughter)and then it looks a little bit better.But what about a recycled paper towelthat comes in those little half sheets?Well, now a paper towel looks better.Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge.I wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water,and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.Unless you're like me and you leave the handlein the position of hot even when you turn it on,and then you start to use more energy.Or worse, you let it run until it's warmto rinse out your towel.And now all bets are off.(Laughter)So what this says is thatsometimes the things that you least expect --the position in which you put the handle --have a bigger effect than any of those other thingsthat you were trying to optimize.Now imagine someone as twisted as metrying to build a house.(Laughter)That's what my husband and I are doing right now.And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?And there's a thousand and one articles out theretelling us how to make all these green trade-offs.And they are just as suspectin telling us to optimize these little things around the edgesand missing the elephant in the living room.Now, the average househas about 300 megawatt hoursof embodied energy in it;this is the energy it takes to make it --millions and millions of paper towels.We wanted to know how much better we could do.And so, like many people,we start with a house on a lot,and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the topand what we're doing on the bottom.So first, we demolish it.It takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it --you take it all apart, you use the bits --you can get some of that energy back.We then dug a big holeto put in a rainwater catchment tankto take our yard water independent.And then we poured a big foundationfor passive solar.Now, you can reduce the embodied energyby about 25 percentby using high fly ash concrete.We then put in framing.And so this is framing -- lumber,composite materials --and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that,but it can be a sustainable resourceif you use FSC-certified lumber.We then go on tothe first thing that was very surprising.If we put aluminum windows in this house,we would double the energy use right there.Now, PVC is a little bit better,but still not as good as the wood that we chose.We then put in plumbing,electrical and HVAC,and insulate.Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks --but it is pretty high embodied energy,and, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeansis a much lower energy alternative to that.We also used straw baleinfill for our library,which has zero embodied energy.When it comes time to sheetrock,if you use EcoRock it's about a quarterof the embodied energy of standard sheetrock.And then you get to the finishes,the subject of all of those "go green" articles,and on the scale of a housethey almost make no difference at all.And yet, all the press is focused on that.Except for flooring.If you put carpeting in your house,it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house,unless you use concrete or woodfor a much lower embodied energy.So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up,and we've built a house for less than halfof the typical embodied energy for building a house like this.But before we pat ourselvestoo much on the back,we have poured 151 megawatt hoursof energy into constructing this housewhen there was a house there before.And so the question is:How could we make that back?And so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward,compared with the old, non-energy-efficient house,we make it back in about six years.Now, I probably would have upgraded the old houseto be more energy-efficient,and in that case,it would take me more about 20 years to break even.Now, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy,it would have taken usover 50 years to break evencompared to the upgraded house.So what does this mean?On the scale of my portion of the house,this is equivalent to aboutas much as I drive in a year,it's about five times as muchas if I went entirely vegetarian.But my elephant in the living room flies.Clearly, I need to walk home from TED.But all the calculationsfor embodied energy are on the blog.And, remember, it's sometimes the things that you are not expectingto be the biggest changes that are.Thank you. (Applause)

You know for me, the interest in contemporary forms of slaverystarted with a leaflet that I picked up in London.It was the early '90s,and I was at a public event.I saw this leaflet and it said,"There are millions of slaves in the world today."And I thought, "No way, no way."And I'm going to admit to hubris.Because I also, I'm going to admit to you,I also thought, "How can I be likea hot-shot young full professorwho teaches human rights and not know this?So it can't be true."Well, if you teach, if you worshipin the temple of learning,do not mock the gods,because they will take you,fill you with curiosity and desire,and drive you. Drive you with a passionto change things.I went out and did a lit review,3,000 articles on the key word "slavery."Two turned out to be about contemporary -- only two.All the rest were historical.They were press pieces and they were full of outrage,they were full of speculation, they were anecdotal --no solid information.So, I began to do a research project of my own.I went to five countries around the world.I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders,and I looked very deeplyinto slave-based businessesbecause this is an economic crime.People do not enslave people to be mean to them.They do it to make a profit.And I've got to tell you, what I found out in the worldin four different continents,was depressingly familiar.Like this:Agricultural workers in Africa,whipped and beaten,showing us how they were beaten in the fieldsbefore they escaped from slaveryand met up with our film crew.It was mind-blowing.And I want to be very clear.I'm talking about real slavery.This is not about lousy marriages,this is not about jobs that suck.This is about people who can not walk away,people who are forced to work without pay,people who are operating 24/7under a threat of violenceand have no pay.It's real slavery in exactly the same waythat slavery would be recognizedthroughout all of human history.Now, where is it?Well, this map in the sort of redder, yellower colorsare the places with the highest densities of slavery.But in fact that kind of bluey colorare the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery.And you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenlandwhere we can't find any cases of enslavementaround the world.We're also particularly interestedand looking very carefullyat places whereslaves are being used to perpetrateextreme environmental destruction.Around the world, slaves are used to destroy the environment,cutting down trees in the Amazon; destroyingforest areas in West Africa;mining and spreading mercury aroundin places like Ghana and the Congo;destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia.It's a pretty harrowing linkagebetween what's happening to our environmentand what's happening to our human rights.Now, how on Earth did we get to a situation like this,where we have 27 million peoplein slavery in the year 2010?That's double the number that came out of Africain the entire transatlantic slave trade.Well, it builds up with these factors.They are not causal, they are actually supporting factors.One we all know about, the population explosion:the world goes from two billion people to almostseven billion people in the last 50 years.Being numerous does not make you a slave.Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of peoplein the developing world,caused by civil wars, ethnic conflicts,kleptocratic governments, disease ... you name it, you know it.We understand how that works. In some countriesall of those things happen at once,like Sierra Leone a few years ago,and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world, in fact,as we know, live on the edge,live in situations wherethey don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute.But that doesn't make you a slave either.What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerableinto a slave, is the absence of the rule of law.If the rule of law is sound, it protectsthe poor and it protects the vulnerable.But if corruption creeps inand people don't have the opportunityto have that protection of the rule of law,then if you can use violence,if you can use violence with impunity,you can reach out and harvest the vulnerableinto slavery.Well, that is precisely what has happened around the world.Though, for a lot of people,the people who stepinto slavery todaydon't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head.They come into slavery becausesomeone has asked them this question.All around the world I've been told an almost identical story.People say, "I was home,someone came into our village,they stood up in the back of a truck, they said, 'I've got jobs,who needs a job?'"And they did exactly whatyou or I would do in the same situation.They said, "That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious,but my children were hungry.We needed medicine.I knew I had to do anything I couldto earn some money to support the people I care about."They climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them.Ten miles, 100 miles, 1,000 miles later,they find themselves in dirty, dangerous, demeaning work.They take it for a little while,but when they try to leave, bang!, the hammer comes down,and they discover they're enslaved.Now, that kind of slaveryis, again, pretty much what slavery has been all through human history.But there is one thing that is particularly remarkableand novel about slavery today,and that is a complete collapsein the price of human beings --expensive in the past, dirt cheap now.Even the business programs have startedpicking up on this.I just want to share a little clip for you.Daphne: OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here, as always,as we get macro and talk commodities.Continuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue,head of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management.And we're also joined by Brent Lawsonfrom Lawson Frisk Securities.Brent Lawson: Happy to be here.D: Good to have you with us, Brent.Now, gentlemen ... Brent, where is your money going this year?BL: Well Daphne, we've been going short on gas and oil recentlyand casting our net just a little bit wider.We really like the human being story a lot.If you look at a long-term chart,prices are at historical lows and yet global demandfor forced labor is still real strong.So, that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on.D: Michael, what's your take on the people story? Are you interested?Michael O'Donoghue: Oh definitely. Non-voluntary labor's greatest advantageas an asset is the endless supply.We're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that.BL: Daphne, if I may draw your attention to one thing.That is that private equity has been sniffing around,and that tells me that this market is about to explode.Africans and Indians, as usual,South Americans, and Eastern Europeans in particularare on our buy list.D: Interesting. Micheal, bottom line, what do you recommend?MO: We're recommending to our clientsa buy and hold strategy.There's no need to play the market.There's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting.D: Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen, thank you very much.Kevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof.Though I enjoyed watchingyour jaws drop, drop, drop, until you got it.MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof,and they've been slipping it in between music videoswithout any introduction, which I think is kind of fun.Here's the reality.The price of human beings across the last 4,000 yearsin today's money has averaged about 40,000 dollars.Capital purchase items.You can see that the lines cross when the population explodes.The average price of a human being today,around the world, is about 90 dollars.They are more expensive in places like North America.Slaves cost between 3,000 to 8,000 dollars in North America,but I could take you places in India or Nepalwhere human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars.They key here is thatpeople have ceased to be that capital purchase itemand become like Styrofoam cups.You buy them cheaply, you use them,you crumple them up, and then when you're donewith them you just throw them away.These young boys are in Nepal.They are basically the transport systemon a quarry run by a slaveholder.There are no roads there, so they carry loads of stoneon their backs, often of their own weight,up and down the Himalaya Mountains.One of their mothers said to us,"You know, we can't survive here,but we can't even seem to die either."It's a horrible situation.And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this,it's that there are also --in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved --there are ex-slaves who are now working to free others.Or, we say, Frederick Douglass is in the house.I don't know if you've ever had a daydreamabout, "Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman?What would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass?"I've got to say, one of the most exciting parts about my jobis that I get to,and I want to introduce you to one of those.His name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghanaenslaved in the fishing industry,and he now, after escape and building a new life,has formed an organization that we work closely withto go back and get people out of slavery.This is not James, this is one of the kids that he works with.James Kofi Annan (Video): He was hit with a paddlein the head. And this reminds meof my childhood when I used to work here.KB: James and our country director in Ghana,Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threatsbecause the two of them managed to getconvictions and imprisonment for three human traffickersfor the very first time in Ghanafor enslaving people, from the fishing industry,for enslaving children.Now, everything I've been telling you,I admit, is pretty disheartening.But there is actually a very positive side to this,and that is this: The 27 million peoplewho are in slavery today,that's a lot of people, but it's alsothe smallest fractionof the global population to ever be in slavery.And likewise, the 40 billion dollars that they generateinto the global economy each yearis the tiniest proportion of the global economyto ever be represented by slave labor.Slavery, illegal in every countryhas been pushed to the edges of our global society.And in a way, without us even noticing,has ended up standing on the precipiceof its own extinction,waiting for us to give it a big bootand knock it over. And get rid of it.And it can be done.Now, if we do that, if we put the resourcesand the focus to it,what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery?Well, first, before I even tell you the costI've got to be absolutely clear.We do not buy people out of slavery.Buying people out of slavery is likepaying a burglar to get your television back;it's abetting a crime.Liberation, however, costs some money.Liberation, and more importantlyall the work that comes after liberation.It's not an event, it's a process.It's about helping people to build lives of dignity,stability, economic autonomy,citizenship.Well, amazingly,in places like India where costs are very low,that family, that three-generation family that you see therewho were in hereditary slavery --so, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery --but the total cost, amortizedacross the rest of the work,was about 150 dollars to bring that familyout of slavery and then take them through a two year processto build a stable life of citizenship and education.A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery, about 400 dollars.In the United States, North America,much more expensive. Legal costs, medical costs ...we understand that it's expensive here:about 30,000 dollars.But most of the people in the world in slaverylive in those places wherethe costs are lowest.And in fact, the global average is about what it isfor Ghana.And that means, when you multiply it up,the estimated cost ofnot just freedom but sustainable freedomfor the entire 27 million people on the planet in slaveryis something like 10.8 billion dollars --what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels,what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system:usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans,or in the last holiday periodwhen we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people,we spent 10.8 billion dollars.Intel's fourth quarter earnings: 10.8 billion.It's not a lot of money at the global level.In fact, it's peanuts.And the great thing about it is thatit's not money down a hole,there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slaveryto work for themselves,are they motivated?They take their kids out of the workplace,they build a school, they say,"We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares,medicine when we're sick,clothing when we're cold."They become consumers and producersand local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly.That's important, all of thatabout how we rebuild sustainable freedom,because we'd never want to repeatwhat happened in this country in 1865.Four million people were lifted up out of slaveryand then dumped.Dumped without political participation,decent education,any kind of real opportunityin terms of economic lives,and then sentenced to generations ofviolence and prejudice and discrimination.And America is still paying the pricefor the botched emancipation of 1865.We have made a commitmentthat we will never let peoplecome out of slavery on our watch,and end up as second class citizens.It's just not going to happen.This is what liberation really looks like.Children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana,reunited with their parents,and then taken with their parents back to their villagesto rebuild their economic well-beingso that they become slave-proof --absolutely unenslaveable.Now, this womanlived in a village in Nepal.We'd been working there about a month.They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery.They'd just begun to light up a little bit,open up a little bit.But when we went to speak with her, when we took this photograph,the slaveholders were still menacing usfrom the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back.I was frightened. We were frightened.We said to her, "Are you worried? Are you upset?"She said, "No, because we've got hope now.How could we not succeed," she said,"when people like you from the other side of the worldare coming here to stand beside us?"Okay, we have to ask ourselves,are we willing to live in a world with slavery?If we don't take action, we just leave ourselves opento have someone else jerk the stringsthat tie us to slavery in the products we buy,and in our government policies.And yet, if there's one thing that every human being can agree on,I think it's that slavery should end.And if there is a fundamental violationof our human dignitythat we would all say is horrific,it's slavery.And we've got to say,what good is all of our intellectualand political and economic power --and I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room --if we can't use it to bring slavery to an end?I think there is enough intellectual power in this roomto bring slavery to an end.And you know what? If we can't do that,if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery,there is one last question:Are we truly free?Okay, thank you so much.(Applause)

So, basically we have public leaders,public officials who are out of control;they are writing bills that are unintelligible,and out of these bills are going to comemaybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity,which has a dramatically negative impact on our life.If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnamyou face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits;if you're trying to get a small business loan,you face a blizzard of paperwork.What are we going to do about it? I define simplicityas a means to achieving clarity,transparency and empathy,building humanity into communications.I've been simplifying things for 30 years.I come out of the advertising and design business.My focus is understanding you people,and how you interact with the governmentto get your benefits,how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with,and how you view brands.So, very quickly, when President Obama said,"I don't see why we can'thave a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement."So, I locked myself in a room,figured out the content,organized the document, and wrote it in plain English.I've had this checked by the two topconsumer credit lawyers in the country.This is a real thing.Now, I went one step further and said,"Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyersand just have a paper document? Let's go online."And many peoplemight need help in computation.Working with the Harvard Business School,you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment:If you spent 62 dollars for a meal,the longer you take to pay out that loan,you see, over a period of time using the minimum paymentit's 99 dollars and 17 cents.How about that? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people?But it's going to work. It's more effectivethan just computational aids.And what about terms like"over the limit"?Perhaps a stealth thing.Define it in context. Tell people what it means.When you put it in plain English,you almost force the institutionto give the people a way, a default out of that,and not put themselves at risk.Plain English is aboutchanging the content.And one of the things I'm most proud ofis this agreement for IBM.It's a grid, it's a calendar.At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities,you have responsibilities.Received very favorably by business.And there is some good news to report today.Each year, one in 10 taxpayersreceives a notice from the IRS.There are 200 million letters that go out.Running through this typical letter that they had,I ran it through my simplicity lab,it's pretty unintelligible.All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover70 percent of their transactions in plain English.They have been tested in the laboratory.When I run it through my lab,this heat-mapping shows everythingis intelligible.And the IRS has introduced the program.(Applause)There are a couple of things going on right nowthat I want to bring to your attention.There is a lot of discussion nowabout a consumer financial protection agency,how to mandate simplicity.We see all this complexity.It's incumbent upon us,and this organization, I believe,to make clarity, transparencyand empathy a national priority.There is no way that we should allow governmentto communicate the way they communicate.There is no way we should do businesswith companies that have agreementswith stealth provisions and that are unintelligible.So, how are we going to change the world?Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.I thank you.(Applause)

If you think about the phone --and Intel has testeda lot of the things I'm going to show you,over the last 10 years,in about 600 elderly households --300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland --trying to understand: How do we measureand monitor behaviorin a medically meaningful way?And if you think about the phone, right,it's something that we can use for some incredible waysto help people actually take the right medication at the right time.We're testing these kinds of simplesensor-network technologies in the homeso that any phone that a senior is already comfortable withcan help them deal with their medications.And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone,and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take,and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend.And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly,that sits on their kitchen table and says,"I'm old. I'm frail."It's surreptitious technologythat's helping them do a simple taskof taking the right pill at the right time.Now, we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones.Because that moment when you answer the phoneis a cognitive test every time that you do it.Think about it, all right? I'm going to answer the phone three different times."Hello? Hey."All right? That's the first time."Hello? Uh, hey.""Hello? Uh, who?Oh, hey."All right? Very big differencesbetween the way I answered the phone the three times.And as we monitor phone usageby seniors over a long period of time,down to the tenths of a microsecond,that recognition momentof whether they can figure out that person on the other endis a friend and we start talking to them immediately,or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk,where they're like, "Wait, who is this? Oh." Right?Waiting for that recognition momentmay be the best early indicator of the onset of dementiathan anything that shows up clinically today.We call these behavioral markers.There's lots of others. Is the person going to the phoneas quickly, when it rings, as they used to?Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem?Has their voice gotten more quiet? We're doing a lot of work with peoplewith Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's,where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patientsmay be the best early indicatorof Parkinson's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically.But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of timeare hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extremeand your voice has become so quiet.So, sensors are looking at that kind of voice.When you pick up the phone,how much tremor are you having,and what is that like, and what is that trend like over a period of time?Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to?Is it a dexterity problem? Is it the onset of arthritis?Are you using the phone? Are you socializing less than you used to?And looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social healthmean, as a kind of a vital sign of the future?And then wow, what a radical idea,we -- except in the United States --might be able to use this newfangled technologyto actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line.Wow, what a great day that will beonce we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things.So, these are what I would call behavioral markers.And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work onfor the last 10 years at Intel.How do you put simple disruptive technologies,and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk?Behavioral markers matter.How do we change behavior?How do we measure changes in behaviorin a meaningful way that's going to help us withprevention of disease, early onset of disease,and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time?Now, why would Intel let mespend a lot of time and money, over the last 10 years,trying to understand the needs of seniorsand start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers?This is some of the field work that we've done.We have now lived with 1,000 elderly householdsin 20 countries over the last 10 years.We study people in Rochester, New York.We go live with them in the winterbecause what they do in the winter,and their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize,is very different than in the summer.If they have a hip fracture we go with themand we study their entire discharge experience.If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network,we fly and study them as well.So, we study the holistic health experienceof 1,000 seniors over the last 10 yearsin 20 different countries.Why is Intel willing to fund that?It's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about.Ten years ago, when I started trying to convince Intelto let me go start looking at disruptive technologiesthat could help with independent living,this is what I called it: "Y2K + 10."You know, back in 2000,we were all so obsessed with paying attentionto the aging of our computers,and whether or not they were going to survivethe tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000,that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to.It was right around New Years.And that switchover,when we had the larger number of older people on the planet,for the first time than younger people.For the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landingor some major other pandemic,that's the expectation from demographers, going forward.And 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of timeto convince Intel to work on this. Right?Y2K + 10 was coming,the baby boomers starting to retire.Well folks, it's like we know these demographics here.This is a map of the entire world.It's like the lights are on,but nobody's home on this demographicY2K + 10 problem. Right?I mean we sort of get it here, but we don't get it here,and we're not doing anything about it.The health reform bill is largely ignoringthe realities of the age wave that's coming,and the implications for what we need to do to changenot only how we pay for care,but deliver care in some radically different ways.And in fact, it's upon us.I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Caseywho is the first boomer to actually get Social Security.That actually occurred this year. She took early retirement.She was born one second after midnight in 1946.A retired school teacher,there she is with a Social Security administrator.The first boomer actually, we didn't even wait till 2011, next year.We're already starting to see early retirement occur this year.All right, so it's here. This Y2K + 10 problem is at our door.This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar,but somehow we can't sort of marshal our governmentand innovative forces to sort of get out in front of itand do something about it. We'll wait untilit's more of a catastrophe, and react,as opposed to prepare for it.So, one of the reasons it's sochallenging to prepare for this Y2K problemis, I want to argue, we have what I would callmainframe poisoning.Andy Grove, about six or seven years ago,he doesn't even know or remember this, in a Fortune Magazine articlehe used the phrase "mainframe healthcare,"and I've been extending and expanding this.He saw it written down somewhere. He's like, "Eric that's a really cool concept."I was like, "Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article.I just extended it."You know, this is the mainframe.This mentality of traveling toand timesharing large, expensive healthcare systemsactually began in 1787.This is the first general hospital in Vienna.And actually the second general hospital in Vienna,in about 1850, was where we started to build outan entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties.And it's a place in which we started developingarchitecture that literally divided the body,and divided care into departments and compartments.And it was reflected in our architecture,it was reflected in the way that we taught students,and this mainframe mentality persists today.Now, I'm not anti-hospital.With my own healthcare problems, I've taken drug therapies,I've traveled to this hospital and others, many, many times.But we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right?And this is mainframe healthcare.And just as 30 years agowe couldn't conceive that we would have the powerof a mainframe computer that took up a room this sizein our purses and on our belts,that we're carrying around in our cell phone today,and suddenly, computing,that used to be an expert driven system,it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives --that shift from mainframe to personal computingis what we have to do for healthcare.We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcareto a personal model of healthcare.We are obsessed with this way of thinking.When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say,"Quick response: healthcare."The first word that comes up is "doctor."The second that comes up is "hospital." And the third is "illness" or "sickness." Right?We are wired, in our imagination, to think about healthcareand healthcare innovation as somethingthat goes into that place.Our entire health reform discussion right now,health I.T., when we talk with policy makers,equals "How are we going to get doctors usingelectronic medical records in the mainframe?"We're not thinking abouthow do we shift from the mainframe to the home.And the problem with this isthe way we conceive healthcare. Right?This is a very reactive, crisis-driven system.We're doing 15-minute exams with patients.It's population-based.We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting,and we fix them up, like Humpty-Dumpty all over again,and send them home,and hope -- we might hand them a brochure, maybe an interactive website --that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe.And the problem is we can't afford it today, folks.We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured.And now we want to do a double-doubleof the age wave coming through?Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different.We've got to focus on the home.We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigmthat moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive,prevention-driven?How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7?How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you?How do we collect not just biological databut behavioral data, psychological data,relational data, in and on and around the home?And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care planthat uses all this great technology that's around usto change our behavior?That's what we need to do for our personal health model.I want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimifrom one of our studies --in her 90s, had to move out of her homebecause her family was worried about falls.Raise your hand if you had a serious fallin your household, or any of your loved ones,your parents or so forth. Right?Classic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior.This is what was happening to Mimi; the family was worried about it,moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility.She tripped over her oxygen tank.Many people in this generation won't press the button,even if they have an alert call system, because they don't want to bother anybody,even though they've been paying 30 dollars a month.Boomers will press the button. Trust me.They're going to be pressing that button non-stop. Right?Mimi broke her pelvis, lay all night, all morning,finally somebody came in and found her,sent her to the hospital.They fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move backinto the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit.First night in the nursing home unit where she had beenin the same assisted living facility, moved her from one bed to another,kind of threw her, rebroke her pelvis,sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from,no one read the chart, put her on Tylenol,which she is allergic to, broke out, got bedsores,basically, had heart problems, and diedfrom the fall and the complications and the errors that were there.Now, the most frightening thing about this isthis is my wife's grandmother.Now, I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English,I work for Intel, I make a good salary,I'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries --it's an area of research that I work on.I have access to senators and CEOs.I can't stop this from happening.What happens if you don't have money, you don't speak Englishor don't have the kind of accessto deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur?How do we actually prevent the vast majority of fallsfrom ever occurring in the first place?Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doingto try to do exactly that.I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer.It's a research platform.It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three-lead ECG.There is all kinds of sort of plug-and-playkind of Legos that you can do to capture, in the wild,in the real world,things like tremor, gait,stride length and those kinds of things.The problem is, our understanding of falls today,like Mimi, is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell,from the State, saying, "What were you doing when you fell?"That's sort of the state of the art.But with something like Shimmer, or we have something called the Magic Carpet,embedded sensors in carpet, or camera-based systemsthat we borrowed from sports medicine,we're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly householdsto collect actual kinematic motion datato understand: What are the subtle changes that are occurringthat can show us that mom has become risk at falls?And most often we can do two interventions,fix the meds mix.I'm a qualitative researcher, but when I look at these data streams coming infrom these homes, I can look at the data and tell you the daythat some doctor prescribed them something that nobody elseknew that they were on, because we see the changesin their patterns in the household. Right?These discoveries of behavioral markers,and behavioral changesare game changing, and like the discovery of the microscopebecause of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before.This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Irelandof -- actually what you're seeing isshe's looking at data,in this picture, from the Magic Carpet.So, we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway,and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months.Here's what some of this data might look like.This is actually sensor firings.These are two different subjects in our study.It's about a year's worth of data.The color represents different rooms they are in the house.This person on the left is living in their own home.This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility.I know this because look at how punctuated meal time iswhen they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right?Now, this doesn't mean that much to you.But when we look at these cycles of dataover a longer period of time -- and we're looking at everything frommotion around different rooms in the house,to sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up,about gait and stride length -- these streams of dataare starting to tell us things about behavioral patternsthat we've never understood before.You can go to ORCATech.org --it has nothing to do with whales, it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology --to see more about that.The problem is, Intel is still one of the largestfunders in the worldof independent living technology research.I'm not bragging about how much we fund;it's how little anyone else actually pays attentionto aging and funds innovation on aging,chronic disease management and independent living in the home.So, my mantra here, my fourth slogan is:10,000 households or bust.We need to drivea national, if not international, Framingham-type heart studyof independent living technologies,where we have 10,000 elderly connected householdswith broadband, full medical characterization,and a platform by which we can start to experimentand turn these from 20-household anecdotal studiesthat the universities fund,to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies.So, 10,000 households or bust.These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies.My fifth and final phrase:I have tried for two years,and there were moments when we were quite close,to make this healthcare reform bill be about reformfrom something and to something,from a mainframe modelto a personal health model,or to mean something more than just a debateabout the public option and how we're going to finance.It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare.We're going to figure something outfor the next 10 years, and try it.No matter who pays for it,we better start doing care in a fundamentally different wayand treating the home and the patientand the family member and the caregiversas part of these coordinated care teamsand using disruptive technologies that are already hereto do care in some pretty fundamental different ways.The president needs to stand up and say,at the end of a healthcare reform debate,"Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of careout of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes,to the home, in 10 years."It's achievable. We should do it economically,we should do it morally,and we should do it for quality of life.But there is no goal within this health reform.It's just a mess today.So, you know, that's my last message to you.How do we set a going-to-the-moon goalof dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming?It's not that innovation and technology is going to be themagic pill that cures all, but it's going to be part of the solution.And if we don't create a personal health movement,something that we're all aiming towards in reform,then we're going to move nowhere.So, I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward.Thanks very much.(Applause)

I speak English,I work for Intel, I make a good salary,I'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries --it's an area of research that I work on.I have access to senators and CEOs.I can't stop this from happening.What happens if you don't have money, you don't speak Englishor don't have the kind of accessto deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur?How do we actually prevent the vast majority of fallsfrom ever occurring in the first place?Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doingto try to do exactly that.I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer.It's a research platform.It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three-lead ECG.There is all kinds of sort of plug-and-playkind of Legos that you can do to capture, in the wild,in the real world,things like tremor, gait,stride length and those kinds of things.The problem is, our understanding of falls today,like Mimi, is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell,from the State, saying, "What were you doing when you fell?"That's sort of the state of the art.But with something like Shimmer, or we have something called the Magic Carpet,embedded sensors in carpet, or camera-based systemsthat we borrowed from sports medicine,we're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly householdsto collect actual kinematic motion datato understand: What are the subtle changes that are occurringthat can show us that mom has become risk at falls?And most often we can do two interventions,fix the meds mix.I'm a qualitative researcher, but when I look at these data streams coming infrom these homes, I can look at the data and tell you the daythat some doctor prescribed them something that nobody elseknew that they were on, because we see the changesin their patterns in the household. Right?These discoveries of behavioral markers,and behavioral changesare game changing, and like the discovery of the microscopebecause of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before.This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Irelandof -- actually what you're seeing isshe's looking at data,in this picture, from the Magic Carpet.So, we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway,and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months.Here's what some of this data might look like.This is actually sensor firings.These are two different subjects in our study.It's about a year's worth of data.The color represents different rooms they are in the house.This person on the left is living in their own home.This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility.I know this because look at how punctuated meal time iswhen they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right?Now, this doesn't mean that much to you.But when we look at these cycles of dataover a longer period of time -- and we're looking at everything frommotion around different rooms in the house,to sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up,about gait and stride length -- these streams of dataare starting to tell us things about behavioral patternsthat we've never understood before.You can go to ORCATech.org --it has nothing to do with whales, it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology --to see more about that.The problem is, Intel is still one of the largestfunders in the worldof independent living technology research.I'm not bragging about how much we fund;it's how little anyone else actually pays attentionto aging and funds innovation on aging,chronic disease management and independent living in the home.So, my mantra here, my fourth slogan is:10,000 households or bust.We need to drivea national, if not international, Framingham-type heart studyof independent living technologies,where we have 10,000 elderly connected householdswith broadband, full medical characterization,and a platform by which we can start to experimentand turn these from 20-household anecdotal studiesthat the universities fund,to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies.So, 10,000 households or bust.These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies.My fifth and final phrase:I have tried for two years,and there were moments when we were quite close,to make this healthcare reform bill be about reformfrom something and to something,from a mainframe modelto a personal health model,or to mean something more than just a debateabout the public option and how we're going to finance.It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare.We're going to figure something outfor the next 10 years, and try it.No matter who pays for it,we better start doing care in a fundamentally different wayand treating the home and the patientand the family member and the caregiversas part of these coordinated care teamsand using disruptive technologies that are already hereto do care in some pretty fundamental different ways.The president needs to stand up and say,at the end of a healthcare reform debate,"Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of careout of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes,to the home, in 10 years."It's achievable. We should do it economically,we should do it morally,and we should do it for quality of life.But there is no goal within this health reform.It's just a mess today.So, you know, that's my last message to you.How do we set a going-to-the-moon goalof dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming?It's not that innovation and technology is going to be themagic pill that cures all, but it's going to be part of the solution.And if we don't create a personal health movement,something that we're all aiming towards in reform,then we're going to move nowhere.So, I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward.Thanks very much.(Applause)

I have a vision for each one of you,and the vision I have for youis that when you wake up in the morning,and doing what you do;that as you go through the day,that as you go through the day,you become radiantly alive several times.And if your life isn't like that,A life is too short to be wasted.I've used up one minute already --is to give you a set of powerful toolswhich can get you started on being there.Is that of interest to you?Audience: Yes.Srikumar Rao: OK.This is a conference on happiness,you're devoting your entire lifeto being happy?is a quest for happiness.Correct?I'd like you to think about the following:What do you have to getin order to be happy?Anybody, quick?Right now, if you were to think about it,in order to be happy."I would like you to consider this:anything that you can get --Is that correct?can go away.Where does that leave you?Not a very nice place, right?What I have to suggest to youin order to be happy.Let me repeat that:In fact, happiness is your innate nature.You cannot not be happy.Now, all of you are very polite,they're not so polite.how come I am not experiencing it?How come I am experiencing my life sucks?"(Laughter)You have spent your entire lifelearning to be unhappy.And the way we learn to be unhappyWe think this is the way the world works.And the more we invest in a mental model,But it isn't: it's just a mental model,so we can be something.so we can be happy.so we can be happy.And the if-then model is:if this happens,then we will be happy.if my boss would have a heart attack,(Laughter)if only I had children,It doesn't matter what it is.The whole notion is if this happens,then I will be happy.between the persons in this audienceAnd the only thing that's differentThink about your life 10 years ago.Spend a minute doing that.Ten years ago, if you remember clearly,there were certain things you wanted.Is that correct?Odds are pretty goodIs that correct?Where has that left you?In exactly the same place, right?the model itself is flawed.changing the "if."I want to become the billionaire CEO,and then I will be happy."You've got your own variation on that.of the equation.I can demonstrate that to you.Can any of you recall a timeMaybe a rainbow, a mountain range,a valley, the sea.Virtually all of you could, right?Have you ever wondered why that happened?The reason that happened is that somehow,for some reason,at that instant,You didn't say,it would be ever so much more beautiful."(Laughter)I'd make it ever so much better."Oh no, the rainbow off-centerwas just fine.The tree with its crooked brancheswas just fine.your habitual-wanting self dropped away,and you felt it.And I know you felt it because now,even now after all those years,you can still remember it.The problem is that your life right now,with all of the problems that you have --is equally perfect.But you do not accept it.In fact, you're spending all your timeYou are not accepting it.And when you're not accepting it,you're buying into the if-then model:if this happens, then I will be happy.And it's the model itself that is flawed.I'd like to share with you that action.that are very successful.actions are within your control,not entirely, but to a large extent.OK?Actions are within your control.and you start to work towards it,and some of the time what you getis the exact opposite of what you wanted?Has that happened to any of you?and this has to change."he bought a very expensive dress for her.and nice things would happen.(Laughter)Has that happened to any of you?of what you wanted?Happens all the time.what we invest in,is the outcome.We define our life in the following way:here I am, here is where I want to go,to where I want to go,and if I succeed, life is wonderful.And if I don't, then I have failed,life is no good, life sucks.True? False?That is how we live.We invest in the outcome,and as I've just pointed out,more than your share of frustration, angstThere is an alternative.you invest in the process.He's very well-known in the United Statesand certainly among basketball fans.both as a player and as a coach.And what he told his entering team --the score doesn't matter.you will find the score to your liking."That is investing in a process.What we do is the exact opposite.We invest in the outcome.because if I get it I will be happy.Now, focusing on the outcome is fine.It gives you direction.Investing in the outcome meansdependent for your well-being.And that is a surefire recipe for failure.What you can do is something else.You can invest in the process.and you put everything into it.And if you succeed, wonderful.And if you don't succeed,still wonderful,you select another outcome and keep going.Let me give you an example.and the child stops crying,and then she gets up, takes a stepand a beautiful smile comes on her face.upsetting your living room arrangements.Right?Now, imagine what would happenif each time the child fell,she would say, "Oh my God, I failed again.I'm never going to learn to walk."And you have to get counseling for herto counsel her and so on?Sounds funny, doesn't it?But that is exactly what we're doing.She's investing in the process,not in the outcome.What we do is the exact opposite.we start investing in the outcome.we are going to get drained as we do.But if, on the other hand, we said,and give it every single bit I could,"every day is a blast,but nothing makes me passionate."So I say, "OK, what would?"Here's my job and here's how much it pays,this is the kind of person my boss is,the kind of people my colleagues are,how many windows I have --a bunch of parameters.it would not take more than six monthsbecause passion exists inside you.It does not exist in the job.right where you are,you are not going to find it outside.then you will find that the external worldrearranges itselfNew people enter your life.It's just a breeze,You hang around the water cooler,you went on a journey.You go on a journeyAll you do is go on journeys."Is this a journey I want to take?And if you start doing that,you will find that your life changes.everything changes.And you begin all of thatby focusing on the process.Invest in the process, not in the outcome.Thank you.

So, what I'm going to do isjust give you the latest episode of India's --maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera,which is cricket.And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:It's got love, joy, happiness,sadness, tears, laughter,lots of deceit, intrigue.And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 yearswhen the audience interest changes.And that's exactly what cricket has done.It's jumped 20 yearsinto 20-over game.And that's what I'm going to talk about,how a small changeleads to a very big revolution.But it wasn't always like that.Cricket wasn't always thisspeed-driven generations game.There was a time when you played cricket,you played timeless test matches,when you played on till the game got over.And there was this game in March 1939that started on the third of Marchand ended on the 14th of March.And it only ended because the English cricketershad to go from Durban to Cape Town,which is a two-hour train journey,to catch the ship that left on the 17th,because the next ship wasn't around for a long time.So, the match was ended in between.And one of the English batsmen said, "You know what?Another half an hour and we would have won."(Laughter)Another half an hour after 12 days.There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained,so they all sat around making friends with each other.But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket:because we had about the same pace of life.(Laughter)The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it?You fought by day, then it was sunset,so everyone went back home.And then you worked out your strategy,and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket wasthat in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.Princes patronize the game,not because they love the game,but because it was a means of ingratiating themselvesto the British rulers.But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket,which was, all you needed was a plank of woodand a rubber ball, and any number of peoplecould play it anywhere.Take a look:You could play it in the dumpwith some rocks over there,you could play it in a little alley --you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.(Laughter)You could play it on the banks of the Ganges --that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.Or you could play many games in one small patch of land,even if you didn't know which game you were actually in.(Laughter)As you can see, you can play anywhere.But slowly the game moved on,you know, finally.You don't always have five days. So, we moved on,and we started playing 50-over cricket.And then an enormous accident took place.In Indian sport we don't make things happen,accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.And we won this World Cup in 1983.And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,and we played it virtually every day.There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.But there was another big date.1983 was when we won the World Cup.1991,'92, we found a finance ministerand a prime ministerwilling to let the world look at India,rather than be this great country of intrigueand mystery in this closed country.And so we allowed multinationals into India.We cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,and we got all the multinationals coming in,with multinational budgets,who looked at per-capita incomeand got very excited about the possibilities in India,and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real, one scripted.The scripted one is what you see in the movies,the real one was cricket.And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me,Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take itall over the world.And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.And so cricket started becoming big;cricket started bringing riches in.Television started covering cricket. For a long timetelevision said, "We won't cover cricketunless you pay us to cover it."Then they said, "OK,the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars."So, it's a bit of a curve, that.And then another big accident happened in our cricket.England invented 20 overs cricket,and said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket."Just as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.Thank God for them.(Laughter)And so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see.India didn't want to play the T20 World Cup.But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin.And then something very dramatic happened.We got to the final, and then this moment,that will remain enshrined forever,for everybody, take a look.(Crowd cheering)The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.Announcer: And Zishan takes it! India wins!What a match for a Twenty20 final.India, the world champions.(Cheering)India, T20 champions.But what a game we had, M. S. Dhonigot it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player.A massive, massive success:India, the world TT champions.Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.The accident, of course, there, was that the batsmanthought the bowler was bowling fast.(Laughter)If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go,but it didn't go. And we suddenly discoveredthat we could be good at this game.And what it also did wasit led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.It was at a time when investment was coming in,India was feeling a little more confident about itself.And so there was a feeling that there was great pridein what we can do.And thankfully for all of us,the English are very good at inventing things,and then the gracious people that they are,they let the world become very good at it.(Laughter)And so England invented T20 cricket,and allowed India to hijack it.It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine,we just took it straight away, as is.(Laughter)And so, we launched our own T20 league.Six weeks, city versus city.It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country --the only two areas in which India was very proud abouttheir country, representing itself on the field.One was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.The other was Indian cricket.Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues.But the people getting into these city leagueswere people who were taking their cues from the West.America is a home of leagues. And they said,"Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India."But was India ready for it?Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.It was never promoted, it was never sold -- it was organized.And look what they did with our beautiful, nice,simple family game.All of a sudden, you had that happening.(Music)An opening ceremony to match every other.This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per monththan New Zealand's population twice over.So, it was a different India.But it was also a slightly more orthodox Indiathat was very happy to be modern,but didn't want to say that to people.And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.(Music)(Laughter)The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.They were not bureaucrats who were forcedinto sport because they didn't actually love it;these were people who ran serious companies.And so they started promoting cricket big time,started promoting clubs big time.And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollarsbefore a ball was bowled,1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years,and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchisesthat were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.But what they were very good at doingwas making it very localized.So, just to give you an example of how they did it --not Manchester United style promotion,but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.(Music)Of course, a lot of people said, "Maybe they dance better than they play."(Laughter)But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.All along, if you wanted a young cricketer,you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality,your own city, and you were very proudof the system that produced those cricketers.Now, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot --if Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example,they needn't go to Kalbadevior Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them,they could go to Trinidad.This was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world,where you can source from anywhereas long as you get the best product at the best price.And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the realitythat you can source the best product for the best priceanywhere in the world.So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago,overnight. And when he had to go back to representthe West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?"He said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today."We said, "No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave;it's about when do you have to reach there?"And so he said, "I've got to reach on date X."And they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one."So, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game,went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport,sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal,second refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.(Laughter)Never would India have thought on this scale before.Never would India have said, "I want a player to playone game for me, and I will use a corporate jetto send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaicato play a game."And I just thought to myself,"Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big."But what this also did was it startedmarrying the two most important things in Indian cricket,which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.There is cricket and the movies.And they came together because people in the moviesnow started owning clubs.And so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.And something very interesting happened.We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team --as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well,you got a hug from Preity Zinta.So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look --everyone's watching Preity Zinta.(Music)And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.We'd all seen matches in Kolkata,but we'd never seen anything like this:Shah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked upfor Kolkata -- not for India, but for Kolkata.But take a look at this.(Music)An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketerbecause they'd won in Kolkata.Can you imagine?And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said?(Applause)"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team."(Laughter)But I thought I'd take this opportunity --there's a few people from Pakistan in here.I'm so happy that you're herebecause I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right?We can play cricket together, we can be friends.So thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.(Applause)There was criticism too because they said,"Players are being bought and sold?Are they grain?Are they cattle?"Because we had this auction, you see.How do you fix a price for a player?And so the auction that followedliterally had people saying,"Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player."There it is.(Music)Auctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai.Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars.HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day --so 250 rupees for a test match,but if you finish in four days you only got 200.The best Indian players who played every test match --every one of the internationals, the top of the line players --standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year.Now they were getting 500,000 for six days' work.Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England,he got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said,"For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard,and I'm earning more than the footballers, wow."And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India.Could you have imagined that day would come?One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work.That's not bad, is it?So, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled.What India was doing, though, was benchmarkingitself against the best in the world,and it became a huge brand.Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.IPL became the biggest brand in Indiaand, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa,and we had to start the tournament in three weeks.Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks.But we did it. You know why?Because no country works as slowly as we dotill three weeks before an event,and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks.(Applause)Our population, which for a long time we thought was a problem,suddenly became our biggest assetbecause there were more people watching --the huge consuming class --everybody came to watch the cricket.We'd also made cricket the only sport in India,which is a pity, but in India every other sportpushes cricket to become big,which is a bit of a tragedy of our times.Now, this last minute before I go --there's a couple of side effects of all this.For a long time, India was this country of poverty,dust, beggars,snake charmers, filth,Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.Cricketers all over the world said,"You know, we love India. We love to play in India."And that felt good, you know?We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on viewand there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.Right so, finally,an English game that India usurped a little bit,but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.If you want to take the game around the world,it's got to be the shortest form of the game.You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end,or you can't take it all over the world.So that's what T20 is doing.Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game biggerand hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.Thank you very much. Thank you.(Applause)

I've always been interested inthe relationship of formal structures and human behavior.If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town, people will move there.Well, law is also a powerful driverof human behavior.And what I'd like to discuss todayis the need to overhaul and simplify the lawto release the energy and passionof Americans, so that we can beginto address the challenges of our society.You might have noticed that law has grownprogressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two.If you run a business, it's hard to do much of anythingwithout calling your general counsel.Indeed, there is this phenomenon nowwhere the general counsels are becoming the CEOs.It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.You need a lawyer to run the company,because there's so much law.But it's not just business that's affected by this,it's actually pressed down into the daily activitiesof ordinary people.A couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody, Wyoming.It was in a grizzly bear preserve,although no one told me that before we went.And our guide was a local science teacher.She was wholly unconcerned about the bears,but she was terrified of lawyers.The stories started pouring out.She'd just been involved in an episode where a parenthad threatened to sue the schoolbecause she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percentwhen he turned the paper in late.The principal didn't want to stand up to the parentbecause he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings.So, she had to go to meeting after meeting, same arguments madeover and over again.After 30 days of sleepless nights, she finally capitulatedand raised the grade.She said, "Life's too short, I just can't keep going with this."About the same time, she was going to take two students to a leadership conferencein Laramie, which is a couple of hours away,and she was going to drive them in her car,but the school said, "No, you can't drive them in the carfor liability reasons.You have to go in a school bus."So, they provided a bus that held 60 peopleand drove the three of them back and forthseveral hours to Laramie.Her husband is also a science teacher,and he takes his biology class on a hikein the nearby national park.But he was told he couldn't go on the hike this yearbecause one of the students in the class was disabled,so the other 25 students didn't get to go on the hike either.At the end of this day I could have filled a bookjust with stories about lawfrom this one teacher.Now, we've been taught to believe that lawis the foundation of freedom.But somehow or another, in the last couple of decades,the land of the free has become a legal minefield.It's really changed our lives in waysthat are sort of imperceptible;and yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time.It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to apediatrician friendin North Carolina. He said,"Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore.You wouldn't want to say something off-the-cuffthat might be used against you."This is a doctor, whose life is caring for people.My own law firm has a list of questionsthat I'm not allowed to askwhen interviewing candidates,such as the sinister question,bulging with hidden motives and innuendo,"Where are you from?"(Laughter)Now for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarmthat lawsuits are out of control.And we read every once in whileabout these crazy lawsuits, like the guyin the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollarsbecause they lost his pair of pants.The case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case.But the reality is, these crazy casesare relatively rare. They don't usually win.And the total of direct tort costin this country is about two percent,which is twice as much as in other countriesbut, as taxes go, hardly crippling.But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg.What's happened here, again,almost without our knowing,is our culture has changed.People no longer feel freeto act on their best judgment.So, what do we do about it?We certainly don't want to give up the rights,when people do something wrong, to seek redress in the courts.We need regulation to make surepeople don't pollute and such.We lack even a vocabulary to deal withthis problem,and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference.We've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute,every issue, is a matter of kind of individual rights.And so we peer through a legal microscope, and look at everything.Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstancesthat explain why Johnnyturned his paper in late in Cody, Wyoming?Is it possible that the doctormight have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker?And of course the hindsight bias is perfect.There's always a different scenario that you can sketch outwhere it's possible that something could have been done differently.And yet, we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope,hoping that we can judge any disputeagainst the standard of a perfect society,where everyone will agree what's fair,and where accidents will be extinct,risk will be no more.Of course, this is Utopia;it's a formula for paralysis, not freedom.It's not the basis of the rule of law,it's not the basis of a free society.So, now I have the first of four propositionsI'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law:You've got to judge law mainlyby its effect on the broader society,not individual disputes.Absolutely vital.So, let's pull back from the anecdotes for a secondand look at our society from high above.Is it working?What does the macro-data show us?Well, the healthcare system has been transformed:a culture pervaded with defensiveness,universal distrust of the system of justice,universal practice of defensive medicine.It's very hard to measurebecause there are mixed motives.Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes,and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong.But reliable estimatesrange between 60 billion and200 billion dollars per year.That's enough to provide care to all the peoplein America who don't have it.The trial lawyers say, "Well, this legal fearmakes doctors practice better medicine."Well that's been studied too, by the Institute of Medicineand others. Turns out that's not the case.The fear has chilled professional interactionso thousands of tragic errors occurbecause doctors are afraidto speak up: "Are you sure that's the right dosage?"Because they're not sure,and they don't want to take legal responsibility.Let's go to schools.As we saw with the teacher in Cody, Wyoming,she seems to be affected by the law.Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law.You could have a separate section of a law libraryaround each of the following legal concepts:due process, special education,no child left behind,zero tolerance, work rules ...it goes on. We did a studyof all the rules that affect one schoolin New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea.Tens of thousands of discreet rules,60 steps to suspend a student from school:It's a formula for paralysis.What's the effect of that? One is a decline in order.Again, studies have shownit's directly attributableto the rise of due process.Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years agowhere they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in Americasay that they spend at least half of their timemaintaining order in the classroom.That means those students are getting half the learningthey're supposed to, because if one child is disrupting the classno one can learn.And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order?They're threatened with a legal claim.We also surveyed that. Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachersin America have been threatened by their studentswith violating their rights, with lawsuitsby their students. They are threatening, their students.It's not that they usually sue,it's not that they would win, but it's anindication of the corrosion of authority.And how has this system of law worked for government?It doesn't seem to be working very well does it?Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington.The other day at the State of the Union speech,President Obama said,and I think we could all agree with this goal,"From the first railroads to the interstate highway system,our nation has always been the first to compete.There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains."Well, actually there is a reason:Environmental review has evolved into a processof no pebble left unturnedfor any major project taking the better part of a decade,then followed by years of litigationby anybody who doesn't like the project.Then, just staying above the Earth for one more second,people are acting like idiots,(Laughter)all across the country.(Applause)Idiots. A couple of years ago,Broward County, Florida, banned running at recess.(Laughter)That means all the boys are going to be ADD.I mean it's just absolutelya formula for failure.My favorite, though, are all the warning labels."Caution: Contents are hot,"on billions of coffee cups.Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand yearsand they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff,but they'll see all these labels, "Contents are extremely hot."They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac.That's the only explanation. Because whywould you have to tell people that something was actually hot?My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure.I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing.Five-inch fishing lure, it's a big fishing lure,with a three pronged hook in the back,and outside it said, "Harmful if swallowed."(Laughter)So, none of these peopleare doing what they think is right.And why not? They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law?Because it gives us the worst of both worlds:It's random -- anybody can sue for almost anythingand take it to a jury, not even an effort at consistency --and it's also too detailed.In the areas that are regulated, there are so many rulesno human could possibly know it.Well how do you fix it? We could spend 10,000 lifetimestrying to prune this legal jungle.But the challenge here is not one of justamending the law,because the hurdle for success is trust.People -- for law to be the platform for freedom,people have to trust it.So, that's my second proposition:Trust is an essential conditionto a free society.Life is complicated enough without legal fear.But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties,because it carries with it the power of state.And so the state can come in.It actually changes the way people think.It's like having a little lawyer on your shouldersall day long, whispering in your ear,"Could that go wrong? Might that go wrong?"It drives people from the smart part of the brain --that dark, deep well of the subconscious,where instincts and experience,and all the other factors of creativityand good judgment are --it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic.Pretty soon the doctor's saying, "Well, I doubtif that headache could be a tumor, but who would protect meif it were? So maybe I'll just order the MRI."Then you've wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests.If you make people self-consciousabout their judgments, studies showyou will make them make worse judgments.If you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the noteswhen she's playing the piece, she can't play the piece.Self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment.Edison stated it best. He said,"Hell, we ain't got no rules around here,we're trying to accomplish something."(Laughter)So, how do you restore trust?Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough,and tort reform, which is a great idea,lowers your cost if you're a businessperson,but it's like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust.States with extensive tort reformstill suffer all these pathologies.So, what's needed is not just to limit claims,but actually create a dry ground of freedom.It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure.And it is this:Law sets boundaries,and on one side of those boundaries are all the thingsyou can't do or must do --you can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes --but those same boundaries are supposed to defineand protect a dry ground of freedom.Isaiah Berlin put it this way:"Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn,within which men shall be inviolable."We've forgotten that second part.Those dikes have burst. People wade through lawall day long.So, what's needed nowis to rebuild these boundaries.And it's especially important to rebuild themfor lawsuits.Because what people can sue for establishes the boundariesfor everybody else's freedom.If someone brings a lawsuit over, "A kid fell off the seesaw,"it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit,all the seesaws will disappear.Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit.And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws, jungle gyms,merry-go-rounds, climbing ropes,nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four,because there's no risk associated with it.So, how do we rebuild it?Life is too complex for...(Applause)Life is too complex for a software program.All these choices involve value judgmentsand social norms, not objective facts.And so here is the fourth proposition.This is what we have, the philosophy we have to change to.And there are two essential elements of it:We have to simplify the law.We have to migrate from all this complexitytowards general principles and goals.The constitution is only 16 pages long.Worked pretty well for 200 years.Law has to be simple enoughso that people can internalize itin their daily choices.If they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.And how do you make it simple?Because life is complex,and here is the hardest and biggest change:We have to restore the authorityto judges and officialsto interpret and apply the law.(Applause)We have to rehumanize the law.To make law simple so that you feel free,the people in charge have to be freeto use their judgment to interpret and apply the lawin accord with reasonable social norms.As you're going down, and walking down the sidewalk during the day,you have to think that if there is a dispute,there's somebody in society who sees it as their jobto affirmatively protect youif you're acting reasonably.That person doesn't exist today.This is the hardest hurdle.It's actually not very hard. Ninety-eight percent of cases, this is a piece of cake.Maybe you've got a claim in small claims courtfor your lost pair of pants for $100,but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars.Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court.Takes five minutes. That's it,it's not that hard.But it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksandbecause we woke up in the 1960sto all these really bad values: racism,gender discrimination, pollution --they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal systemwhere no one could have bad values anymore.The problem is, we created a systemwhere we eliminated the right to have good values.It doesn't mean that people in authoritycan do whatever they want.They're still bounded by legal goals and principles:The teacher is accountable to the principal,the judge is accountable to an appellate court,the president is accountable to voters.But the accountability's up the linejudging the decision against the effect on everybody,not just on the disgruntled person.You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator.(Applause)So, what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy.We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy.We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom.It's not true. Authority, in fact,is essential to freedom.Law is a human institution;responsibility is a human institution.If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom,to maintain order, everybody's learning suffers.If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims,then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders.If the environmental agency can't decidethat the power lines are good for the environment,then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farmsto the city.A free society requires red lights and green lights,otherwise it soon descends into gridlock.That's what's happened to America. Look around.What the world needs nowis to restore the authority to make common choices.It's the only way to get our freedom back,and it's the only way to release the energy and passionneeded so that we can meet the challengesof our time. Thank you.(Applause)

I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.And that might seem a bit surprising becausemy full-time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds,about the things that we need to invent and deliverto help the poorest two billion live better lives.But energy and climate are extremely important to these people --in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow:There will be too much rain, not enough rain,things will change in waysthat their fragile environment simply can't support.And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.Also, the price of energy is very important to them.In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of,to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.Now, the price of energy has come down over time.Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution,and, even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity,and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning,we can make modern materials and do so many things.And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.But, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap --we need to meet a new constraint,and that constraint has to do with CO2.CO2 is warming the planet,and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one.If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,that leads to a temperature increase,and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects:the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects,in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes,and so you get ecosystem collapses.Now, the exact amount of how you mapfrom a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will beand where the positive feedbacks are,there's some uncertainty there, but not very much.And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be,but they will be extremely bad.I asked the top scientists on this several times:Do we really have to get down to near zero?Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?And the answer is that until we get near to zero,the temperature will continue to rise.And so that's a big challenge.It's very different than saying "We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,and we can just sort of squeeze under."This is something that has to get to zero.Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year,over 26 billion tons.For each American, it's about 20 tons;for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.And, somehow, we have to make changesthat will bring that down to zero.It's been constantly going up.It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all,so we have to go from rapidly risingto falling, and falling all the way to zero.This equation has four factors,a little bit of multiplication:So, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,and that's going to be based on the number of people,the services each person's using on average,the energy on average for each service,and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.So, let's look at each one of theseand see how we can get this down to zero.Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.Now that's back from high school algebra,but let's take a look.First, we've got population.The world today has 6.8 billion people.That's headed up to about nine billion.Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,health care, reproductive health services,we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent,but there we see an increase of about 1.3.The second factor is the services we use.This encompasses everything:the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.These are very good things:getting rid of poverty means providing these servicesto almost everyone on the planet.And it's a great thing for this number to go up.In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,we probably could cut back and use less,but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up,and so, over all, that will more than doublethe services delivered per person.Here we have a very basic service:Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework?And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going outand reading their school work under the street lamps.Now, efficiency, E, the energy for each service,here finally we have some good news.We have something that's not going up.Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings --there are a lot of services where you can bringthe energy for that service down quite substantially.Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.There are other services like how we make fertilizer,or how we do air transport,where the rooms for improvement are far, far less.And so, overall here, if we're optimistic,we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.But for these first three factors now,we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,and that just won't cut it.So let's look at this fourth factor --this is going to be a key one --and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero?If you burn coal, no.If you burn natural gas, no.Almost every way we make electricity today,except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale,is create a new system.And so, we need energy miracles.Now, when I use the term "miracle," I don't mean something that's impossible.The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.The Internet and its services are a miracle.So, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles.Usually, we don't have a deadline,where you have to get the miracle by a certain date.Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speedand get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this?Is there some kind of natural illustration,some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?"I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos,and somehow people enjoyed that.(Laughter)It really got them involved in the idea of,you know, there are people who live with mosquitos.So, with energy, all I could come up with is this.I decided that releasing fireflieswould be my contribution to the environment here this year.So here we have some natural fireflies.I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.(Laughter)Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one,but they don't really add up to much.We need solutions -- either one or several --that have unbelievable scaleand unbelievable reliability,and, although there's many directions people are seeking,I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers.I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.Those may make some contribution,and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better,but my key point hereis that we're going to have to work on each of these five,and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,because they all have significant challenges.Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels,either burning coal or burning natural gas.What you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not,and that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue,pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere,and hope it stays there.Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level,but getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky,and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard,but the toughest one here is this long-term issue.Who's going to be sure?Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times largerthan any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?This is a lot of volume.So that's a tough one.Next would be nuclear.It also has three big problems:Cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high;the issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong,that, even though you have these human operators,that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.And then what do you do with the waste?And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.People need to feel good about it.So three very tough problems that might be solvable,and so, should be worked on.The last three of the five, I've grouped together.These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel --they have some disadvantages.One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologiesis dramatically less than a power plant.This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles,thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant.Also, these are intermittent sources.The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day,and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.And so, if you depend on these sources,you have to have some way of getting the energyduring those time periods that it's not available.So, we've got big cost challenges here,we have transmission challenges:for example, say this energy source is outside your country;you not only need the technology,but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere.And, finally, this storage problem.And, to dimensionalize this, I went through and looked atall the types of batteries that get made --for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything --and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses,and what I found is that all the batteries we make nowcould store less than 10 minutes of all the energy.And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here,something that's going to be a factor of 100 betterthan the approaches we have now.It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent sourceto be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using.If you're counting on it for 100 percent,you need an incredible miracle battery.Now, how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach?Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there?Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundreds.In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people.And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "They're crazy." That's good.And, I think, here in the TED group,we have many people who are already pursuing this.Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolarthat has some great solar thermal technologies.Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companiesthat are doing great things and have interesting possibilities,and I'm trying to help back that.Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a companythat, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid.And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago,so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising.The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium --the one percent, which is the U235 --we decided, "Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238."It is kind of a crazy idea.In fact, people had talked about it for a long time,but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not,and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputersthat now you can simulate and see that, yes,with the right material's approach, this looks like it would work.And, because you're burning that 99 percent,you have greatly improved cost profile.You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuelall the leftover waste from today's reactors.So, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing.It breathes this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle.You can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor.In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem.I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky.This is the leftover, the 99 percent,where they've taken out the part they burn now,so it's called depleted uranium.That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years.And, simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process,you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead,but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideasthat we need to move forward.So let's think: How should we measure ourselves?What should our report card look like?Well, let's go out to where we really need to get,and then look at the intermediate.For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction.That really is very important, that we get there.And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries,still some agriculture,hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.So, to get to that 80 percent,the developed countries, including countries like China,will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether.So, the other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology,have we deployed it in all the developed countriesand we're in the process of getting it elsewhere?That's super important.That's a key element of making that report card.So, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like?Well, again, it should have the two elements.We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions:The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2,and, therefore, the less the temperature.But in some ways, the grade we get there,doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions,is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other,which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed,and we can measure that in terms of companies,pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed.There's a lot of great books that have been written about this.The Al Gore book, "Our Choice"and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."They really go through it and create a frameworkthat this can be discussed broadly,because we need broad backing for this.There's a lot that has to come together.So this is a wish.It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years --I could pick who's president,I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love,or I could pick that this thingthat's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented --this is the wish I would pick.This is the one with the greatest impact.If we don't get this wish,the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible,between the U.S. and China, between poor countries and rich,and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse.So, what do we have to do?What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive?We need to go for more research funding.When countries get together in places like Copenhagen,they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.They should discuss this innovation agenda,and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spendingon these innovative approaches.We do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade --something that gets that price signal out there.We need to get the message out.We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue,including the steps that the government takes.This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower, right --I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?Bil Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer,hire all the great scientists, which we've done,that's only tens of millions,and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactorto make sure that our materials work properly,then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions.The tough thing is building the pilot reactor;finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the locationthat will actually build the first one of these.Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised,then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density,are so different than nuclear as we know it.CA: And so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the groundalmost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel,of this sort of spent uranium,and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?BG: That's right. Today, you're always refueling the reactor,so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong:that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out,that's not good.So, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in --just think of it as a log --put it down and not have those same complexities.And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done.CA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution.BG: Yeah. Well, what happens with the waste,you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach --then you can actually take that,and put it into another one and burn that.And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today,that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors --that's our fuel to begin with.So, the thing that's been a problem from those reactorsis actually what gets fed into ours,and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramaticallyas you're going through this process.CA: I mean, you're talking to different people around the worldabout the possibilities here.Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this?BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place,and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called "nuclear,"so we've got a lot of interest,that people from the company have been in Russia, India, China --I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here,talking about how this fits into the energy agenda.So I'm optimistic. You know, the French and Japanese have done some work.This is a variant on something that has been done.It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor,and a lot of countries have built them,so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built.CA: So, in your mind, timescale and likelihoodof actually taking something like this live?BG: Well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation thingsthat's very cheap,we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy.That's sort of the deadline that the environmental modelshave shown us that we have to meet.And, you know, TerraPower, if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot --could easily meet that.And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies --we need it to be hundreds --who, likewise, if their science goes well,if the funding for their pilot plants goes well,that they can compete for this.And it's best if multiple succeed,because then you could use a mix of these things.We certainly need one to succeed.CA: In terms of big-scale possible game changes,is this the biggest that you're aware of out there?BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.It would have been, even without the environmental constraint,but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater.In the nuclear space, there are other innovators.You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one,but the modular people, that's a different approach.There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard,but maybe they say that about us.And so, there are different ones,but the beauty of this is a molecule of uraniumhas a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal,and so -- if you can deal with the negatives,which are essentially the radiation --the footprint and cost, the potential,in terms of effect on land and various things,is almost in a class of its own.CA: If this doesn't work, then what?Do we have to start taking emergency measuresto try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?BG: If you get into that situation,it's like if you've been over-eating, and you're about to have a heart attack:Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something.There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering,which are various techniques that would delay the heatingto buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.Now, that's just an insurance policy.You hope you don't need to do that.Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policybecause it might make you lazy,that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you.I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem,but there's now the geoengineering discussionabout -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster,or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect?CA: Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them,how might you persuade them that they're wrong?BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps.The ones who make scientific arguments are very few.Are they saying that there's negative feedback effectsthat have to do with clouds that offset things?There are very, very few things that they can even saythere's a chance in a million of those things.The main problem we have here, it's kind of like AIDS.You make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later.And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems,the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later,and a somewhat uncertain pain thing --in fact, the IPCC report, that's not necessarily the worst case,and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCCand say, "OK, that isn't that big of a deal."The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this.But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic,and meet the CO2 constraints,then the skeptics say, "OK,I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2,I kind of wish it did put out CO2,but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before."(Applause)CA: And so, that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument,that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem,it's going to take away all your other goalsof trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth,it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards thatwhen there are better things we can do.BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&amp;D piece --say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now --it's not that dramatic.It shouldn't take away from other things.The thing you get into big money on, and this, reasonable people can disagree,is when you have something that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that --that, to me, mostly is a waste.Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curveand it's going to get very cheap,I believe we should try more things that have a potentialto be far less expensive.If the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive,"then the rich can afford that.I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energyand not change our lifestyle.The disaster is for that two billion.And even Lomborg has changed.His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&amp;D getting more discussed?"He's still, because of his earlier stuff,still associated with the skeptic camp,but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp,and so, he's making the R&amp;D point.And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate.The R&amp;D piece, it's crazy how little it's funded.CA: Well Bill, I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people hereto say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much.BG: Thank you.(Applause)

Someone once said that politics is, of course, "showbiz for ugly people."So, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived.The other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician,to give a TED talk, particularly here in the U.K.,where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low.There was even a story recently that scientists had thought aboutactually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.And someone asked,"Why?"and they said, "Well, there's no shortage of politicians,no one really minds what happens to themand, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."(Laughter)Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide.This, I think, is the most important fact to bear in mindin British politics or American politics,and that is: We have run out of money.We have vast budget deficits.This is my global public debt clock,and, as you can see, it's 32 trillion and counting.And I think what this leads tois a very simple recognition,that there's one question in politics at the moment above all other,and it's this one: How do we make things better without spending more money?Because there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services,or to improve government, or to improve so many of the thingsthat politicians talk about.So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money --you can only measure success in public servicesin health care and education and policing by spending more money,you can only measure progress by spending money --you're going to have a pretty miserable time.But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being --things like your family relationships, friendship, community, values --then, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics.And the really simple argument I want to make tonight,the really straightforward argument is this:That if we combine the right political philosophy, the right political thinking,with the incredible information revolution that has taken place,and that all of you know so much more about than I do,I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics,remake government, remake public services,and achieve what's up on that slide, which is a big increase in our well-being.That's the argument I want to make tonight.So, starting with the political philosophy.Now I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers.Of course we don't.But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophythat are really relevant to this whole debate.The first is this: We believe that if you give peoplemore power and control over their lives,if you give people more choice,if you put them in the driving seat,then actually, you can create a stronger and better society.And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundanceof information that we have in our world today,I think you can completely, as I've said,remake politics, remake government, remake your public services.The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature.Politics and politicians will only succeedif they actually try and treat with people as they are,rather than as they would like them to be.Now, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought --go with the grain of human nature --with all the advances in behavioral economics,some of which we were just hearing about,again, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being,in happiness, in a stronger societywithout necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money.Now, why do I think now is the moment to make this argument?Well, I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short, condensed history lessonabout what I would say are the three passages of history:the pre-bureaucratic age, the bureaucratic ageand what we now live in, which I think is a post-bureaucratic age.A simpler way of thinking of itis that we have gone from a world of local control,then we went to a world of central control,and now we're in a world of people control.Local power, central power, now, people power.Now, here is King Cnut, king a thousand years ago.Thought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves.Couldn't actually turn back very much,because if you were king a thousand years ago,while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country,there wasn't much you were in charge of.You weren't in charge of policing, justice, education, health, welfare.You could just about go to war and that was about it.This was the pre-bureaucratic age,an age in which everything had to be local.You had to have local control because there was no nationally-available informationbecause travel was so restricted.So this was the pre-bureaucratic age.Next part of the cold history lesson,the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution.Suddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible,and this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age.And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are.Suddenly, you have the big, strong, central state.It was able -- but only it was able -- to organizehealth care, education, policing, justice.And it was a world of, as I say, not local power, but now central power.It had sucked all that power up from the localities.It was able to do that itself.The next great stage, which all of you are so familiar with:the massive information revolution.Just consider this one fact:One hundred years ago, sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars.Right now, here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else,and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost,and we can send and receive huge quantities of informationwithout it costing anything.So we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age,where genuine people power is possible.Now, what does this mean for our politics,for our public services, for our government?Well I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples,but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change.And this is so obvious, in a way, becauseyou think about how all of you have changedthe way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.That is already happened; the information and Internet revolutionhas actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways,but it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government.So, how could this happen?Well, I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference:in transparency, in greater choice and in accountability,in giving us that genuine people power.If we take transparency, here is one of my favorite websites,the Missouri Accountability Portal.In the old days, only the government could hold the information,and only a few elected people could try and grab that informationand question it and challenge it.Now here, on one website, one state in America,every single dollar spent by that governmentis searchable, is analyzable, is checkable.Think of the huge change that means:Any business that wants to bid for a government contractcan see what currently is being spent.Anyone thinking, "I could do that service better, I could deliver it cheaper,"it's all available there.We have only, in government and in politics,started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial worldwith the information revolution.So, complete transparency will make a huge difference.In this country, if we win the election,we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 poundstransparent and available online, searchable for anyone to see.We're going to make every contract -- we're announcing this today --available on the Internet so anyone can seewhat the terms are, what the conditions are,driving huge value for money,but also huge increases, I believe, in well-being as well.Choice. Now you all shop online, compare online, do everything online,and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surfaceof public services like education, or health care or policing,and you're going to see this change massively.We should be making this changewith the information revolution in our country,with searchable health sites, so you can see what operations work out properly,what records doctors have, the cleanliness of hospitals,who does best at infection control --all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Healthis now available for all of us to see.And the third of these big changes: accountability.This, I think, is a huge change.It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago.So, instead of having a situation where only the police have the informationabout which crimes are committed where,and we have to employ people in governmentto try and hold the police to account,suddenly, we've got this vast opportunity for people power,where we, as citizens, can see what crimes are being committed --where, when and by whom --and we can hold the police to account.And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat,but actually that's an assault, the one in blue.You can see what crime is committed where,and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account.So those three ways -- transparency, accountability and choice --will make a huge difference.Now I also said the other principlethat I think we should work on is understanding of people,is recognizing that going with the grain of human natureyou can achieve so much more.Now, we're got a huge revolution in understandingof why people behave in the way that they do,and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use.We're working with some of these people.We're being advised by some of these people, as was said,to try and bring all the experience to book.Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple, and I love.We want to get people to be more energy efficient.Why? It cuts fuel poverty, it cuts their bills,and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time.How do you do it?Well, we've had government information campaigns over the yearswhen they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home.We even had -- one government minister once told us tobrush our teeth in the dark.I don't think they lasted very long.Look at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics.The best way to get someone to cut their electricity billis to show them their own spending,to show them what their neighbors are spending,and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending.That sort of behavioral economicscan transform people's behaviorin a way that all the bullying and all the informationand all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve.Other examples are recycling.We all know we need to recycle more.How do we make it happen?All the proof from America is that actually, if you pay people to recycle,if you give them a carrot rather than a stick,you can transform their behavior.So what does all this add up to?Here are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last 50 years.Obviously, here we have JFK with that incredibly simpleand powerful formulation,"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,"an incredibly noble sentiment.But when he made that speech, what could you doto build the stronger, better society?You could fight for your country, you could die for your country,you could serve in your country's civil service,but you didn't really have the information and the knowledgeand the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now.And I think an even more wonderful speech,which I'm going to read a big chunk of,which sums up what I said at the beginningabout believing there is more to life than money,and more that we should try and measure than money.And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful descriptionof why gross national product captures so little:It "does not allow for the health of our children,the quality of their education, or the joy of their play.It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages,the intelligence of our public debate.It measures neither our wit nor our courage,neither our wisdom nor our learning,neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.It measures everything, in short,except that which makes life worthwhile."Again, a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago,and a beautiful dream 40 years ago,but now with the huge advances in information technology,with the massive changes in behavioral economics,with all that we know about how you advance well-being,that if we combine those insightsof giving power to people, and using information to make that possible,and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature,while at the same time, understanding why people behave in the way they do,it is a dream more easy to realize todaythan it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago.Thank you.(Applause)

Sadly,in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,four Americans that are aliveMy name's Jamie Oliver.I'm 34 years old.I'm from Essex in Englandand for the last seven yearsI'm not a doctor;I'm a chef,I don't have expensive equipmentor medicine.I use information, education.has a primal place in our homesthat binds us to the best bits of life.We have an awful, awful reality right now.America, you're at the top of your game.Can I please just see a raise of handsPut your hands up.Most of you. OK.have blessed our children with the destinyTwo-thirds of this room,You lot, you're all right,but we'll get you eventually, don't worry.(Laughter)The statistics of bad health are clear,very clear.Right?(Laughter)(Applause)This is a global problem.It's a catastrophe.It's sweeping the world.England is right behind you, as usual.(Laughter)We need a revolution.Mexico, Australia, Germany,India, China,Think about smoking.It costs way less than obesity now.150 billion dollars a year.In 10 years, it's set to double:300 billion dollars a year.(Laughter)We need it. The time is now.We're in a tipping-point moment.I've been doing this for seven years.I went to the eye of the storm.Or it was last year.(Laughter)Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town.I wanted to put heart and soul and people,your public,your public, your children.She's 16 years old.She's got six years to livebecause of the food that she's eaten.She's the third generation of Americansor her mom, or her mom's mom.She has six years to live.She's eating her liver to death.Stacy, the Edwards family.This is a normal family, guys.The family's obese.He gets bullied, for God's sake.But you know what?her uncle, died of obesity,and now her step-dad is obese.You see, the thing is,obesity and diet-related diseasedoesn't just hurt the people that have it;Pastor Steve:an inspirational man,He has to bury the people, OK?And he's fed up with it.He's sick of it.We're not geared up to do this.Can't even get them there. Forklift.OK, I see it as a triangle, OK?This is our landscape of food.I need you to understand it.You've probably heard all this before.Over the last 30 years,Let's be frank and honest.Well, modern-day life.Let's start with the Main Street.powerful powers, in this country.(Sighs)Supermarkets as well.Big companies. Big companies.Thirty years ago, most of the foodwas largely local and largely fresh.Labeling is a massive problem.Home.The biggest problem with the homewhat made our society.That is not happening anymore.and as life always evolves,It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?I want to show you a situation(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.And I need you to knowHow are you feeling?and this isn't going to get them there.But I'm killing them.JO: Yes you are. You are.But we can stop that.Normal.Let's get on schools,OK, school.to make us creative, do wonderful things,make us earn a living, etc., etc.But we haven't really evolved itSchool food is something180 days of the year.judging the circumstances.(Laughter)Before I crack into my rant,which I'm sure you're waiting for --(Laughter)in the next three months.I offer myself as their ambassador.I'm not slagging them off.They're doing the best they can do.They're doing their best.But they're doing what they're told,The system is highly run by accountants;There's a problem:If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker,is buy cheaper shit.Now, the reality is,it's highly processed,ingredients you wouldn't believe --there's not enough veggies at all.French fries are considered a vegetable.They have scissors in the classroom,but knives and forks? No.And the way I look at it is:you're purely endorsing,And yes, by the way, it is fast food:It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers,(Sighs)is on obesity, and it's going to double.We're not teaching our kids.elementary or secondary school, OK?We don't teach kids about food, right?which is very common in England.(Video) Who knows what this is?Child: Potatoes.Do you know what that is?Do you know what that is?Child: Broccoli?JO: What about this? Our good old friend.Child: Celery.JO: No. What do you think this is?Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is,then they will never eat it.(Laughter)JO: Normal. England and America,England and America.Guess what fixed that.Two one-hour sessions.(Applause)I want to tell you about somethingEvery kid has the right to milk at school.They'll be having two bottles, OK?And most kids do.But milk ain't good enough anymore.Don't get me wrong, I support milk --but someone at the milk boardthat if you put loads of flavorings,colorings and sugar in milk,more kids will drink it.Yeah.Obviously now that's going to catch onthe apple board is going to work outDo you know what I mean?Okay? There's sugar in everything.It's in everything.There's our milk. There's our carton.and they are having two a day.So, let me just show you.We've got one kid, here --You know, there's your week.There's your month.And I've taken the liberty of putting injust from milk.Now, I don't know about you guys,but judging the circumstances, right,any judge in the whole world,That's my belief.(Applause)(Applause ends)and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer,This, all this bad news, is preventable.That's the good news.It's very, very preventable.we need to reboot.Here is the thing, right,it cannot just come from one source.To reboot and make real tangible change,and say, "In 10 years' time,the history of your children's lives,you know you're going to live longer --So, supermarkets.Where else do you shop so religiously?Week in, week out.Love them.They just sell us what we want. All right.They need to help us shop.for people that are busy.This is not expensive.in America soon, and quick.The big brands, you know, the food brands,I know, easier said than done.It's the future. It's the only way.Fast food.With the fast-food industryyou know, it's very competitive.with fast food restaurants.I know how they do it.I mean, basically they've weaned us onand everyone loves them, right?But we need to get the government to workand over a five, six, seven year periodwean of us off the extreme amountsNow, also, back to the sort of big brands:and has got to be sorted.OK, school.Obviously, in schools, we owe it to themto make sure those 180 days of the year,from that little precious age of four,until 18, 20, 24, whatever,they need to be cooked proper, fresh foodfrom local growers on site, OK?for your children, yeah?(Applause)knowing how to cook 10 recipesthat will save their life.Life skills.(Applause)If you can cook, time doesn't matter.Marissa, her father died in her hand,I think she'd be quite happyDefinitely they shouldn't be left out.Let's go back to the home.it's so achievable.You can care and be commercial.Absolutely.For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.And for me, it's quite romantic,how to cook something,and they teach three of their mates,that only has to repeat itself 25 times,Romantic, yes, but most importantly,it's about trying to get people to realizeWe've got to put back what's been lost.Huntington's Kitchen.Huntington, where I made this program,we've got this prime-time programI truly believe that change will happen.I worked in the schools.I found local sustainable fundingsix-and-a-half grand per school.(Applause)The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay?This can do 5,000 people a year,which is 10 percent of their population,and it's people on people.Around America, if we just look back now,in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups,garden set-ups, education --The problem is they all want to roll outwhat they're doing to the next school,but there's no cash.and doing well.Businesses of America need to support(Applause)And look, I know it's weirdtalking about all this.All I can say is: I care.I'm a father,and I love this country.And I believe truly, actually,It's incredibly important.(Audience) Yeah!(Applause)When I was in Huntington,And I thought, "You know what?movers and shakers in America."I'm here.So, my wish.Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.My wishto educate every childabout food,to inspire families to cook again,and to empower people everywhereto fight obesity.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause continues)

So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in Americaand a Japanese man comes up to you and says,"Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.This is 26th, that's 27th."He says, "OK, but what is the name of that block?"You say, "Well, blocks don't have names.Streets have names; blocks are just theunnamed spaces in between streets."He leaves, a little confused and disappointed.So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,you turn to a person next to you and say,"Excuse me, what is the name of this street?"They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."And you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?"And they say, "Well, streets don't have names.Blocks have names.Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.All of these blocks have names,and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks.And you say then, "OK, then how do you know your home address?"He said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight.There's Block 17, house number one."You say, "OK, but walking around the neighborhood,I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."He says, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.The first house ever built on a block is house number one.The second house ever built is house number two.Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."So, I love that sometimes we need togo to the opposite side of the worldto realize assumptions we didn't even know we had,and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.So, for example, there are doctors in Chinawho believe that it's their job to keep you healthy.So, any month you are healthy you pay them,and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failedat their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick.(Applause)In most music, we think of the "one"as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.But in West African music, the "one"is thought of as the end of the phrase,like the period at the end of a sentence.So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:two, three, four, one.And this map is also accurate.(Laughter)There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,the opposite is also true.So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,that the opposite may also be true.Domo arigato gozaimashita.

So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in Americaand a Japanese man comes up to you and says,"Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.This is 26th, that's 27th."He says, "OK, but what is the name of that block?"You say, "Well, blocks don't have names.Streets have names; blocks are just theunnamed spaces in between streets."He leaves, a little confused and disappointed.So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,you turn to a person next to you and say,"Excuse me, what is the name of this street?"They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."And you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?"And they say, "Well, streets don't have names.Blocks have names.Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.All of these blocks have names,and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks.And you say then, "OK, then how do you know your home address?"He said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight.There's Block 17, house number one."You say, "OK, but walking around the neighborhood,I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."He says, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.The first house ever built on a block is house number one.The second house ever built is house number two.Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."So, I love that sometimes we need togo to the opposite side of the worldto realize assumptions we didn't even know we had,and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.So, for example, there are doctors in Chinawho believe that it's their job to keep you healthy.So, any month you are healthy you pay them,and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failedat their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick.(Applause)In most music, we think of the "one"as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.But in West African music, the "one"is thought of as the end of the phrase,like the period at the end of a sentence.So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:two, three, four, one.And this map is also accurate.(Laughter)There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,the opposite is also true.So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,that the opposite may also be true.Domo arigato gozaimashita.

As an Indian, and now as a politicianand a government minister,I've become rather concerned aboutthe hype we're hearing about our own country,all this talk about India becoming a world leader,even the next superpower.In fact, the American publishers of my book,"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,"added a gratuitous subtitle saying,"India: The next 21st-century power."And I just don't think that's what India's all about,or should be all about.Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadershipseems to me terribly archaic.It's redolent of James Bond moviesand Kipling ballads.After all, what constitutes a world leader?If it's population, we're on course to top the charts.We will overtake China by 2034.Is it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.The Americans have even recognized it,in an agreement.Is it the economy? Well, we have nowthe fifth-largest economy in the worldin purchasing power parity terms.And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,we grew at 6.7 percent.But, somehow, none of that adds up to me,to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,in this part of the 21st century.And so I wondered, couldwhat the future beckons for India to be all aboutbe a combination of these things allied to something else,the power of example,the attraction of India's culture,what, in other words, people like to call "soft power."Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,Joseph Nye, a friend of mine.And, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,it's essentially the ability of a country to attract othersbecause of its culture, its political values,its foreign policies.And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,but we know the Alliance Francaiseis all about French soft power, the British Council.The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.But, the fact is, in fact,that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonaldshave done more for American soft poweraround the world than any specifically government activity.So soft power is something that really emergespartly because of governments,but partly despite governments.And in the information era we all live in today,what we might call the TED age,I'd say that countries are increasingly being judgedby a global public that's been fedon an incessant diet of Internet news,of televised images,of cellphone videos, of email gossip.In other words, all sorts of communication devicesare telling us the stories of countries,whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.Now, in this age, again, countries with accessto multiple channels of communicationand information have a particular advantage.And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.India has more all-news TV channelsthan any country in the world,in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.But, the fact still is that it's not just that.In order to have soft power, you have to be connected.One might argue that India has becomean astonishingly connected country.I think you've already heard the figures.We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.Currently there are 509 million cellphonesin Indian hands, in India.And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.In fact, those 15 million cellphonesare the most connections that any country,including the U.S. and China,has ever established in the history of telecommunications.But, what perhaps some of you don't realizeis how far we've come to get there.You know, when I grew up in India,telephones were a rarity.In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliamenthad the right to allocate 15 telephone linesas a favor to those they deemed worthy.If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessmanor an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.But sometimes it just sat there.I went to high school in Calcutta.And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.But half the time we would pick it upwith an expectant look on our faces,there would be no dial tone.If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.In fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello."(Laughter)If you then wanted to connect to another city,let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,you'd have to book something called a trunk call,and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.Or you could pay eight times the going ratefor something called a lightning call.But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.In fact, so woeful was our telephone servicethat a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly mannerthat in a developing countrycommunications are a luxury, not a right,that the government had no obligation to provide better service,and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting listfor telephones in India.Now, fast-forward to today and this is what you see:the 15 million cell phones a month.But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cartthat looks like it was designed in the 16th century,wielding a coal-fired steam ironthat might have been invented in the 18th century.He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.The other day I was in Kerala, my home state,at the country farm of a friend,about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.And it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?"And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drinkon a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,and a voice said, "I'm up here."And right on top of the nearest coconut tree,with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,was a local toddy tapper,who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coastto find out where they get the best possible prices.Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking laborto find out if the market town was open,if the market was on,whether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudgeto the market town to get that information and come back,then they'd load the cart.Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.So this empowerment of the underclassis the real result of India being connected.And that transformation is part of where India is heading today.But, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarizedin the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump --Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me --and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.And the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad."And the second goat says, "No, the book was better."(Laughter)I usually tend to think that the book is usually better,but, having said that,the fact is that Bollywood is nowtaking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate motherin a village in Senegaltakes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,just to watch a Bollywood movie.She can't understand the dialogue.She's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.And this is happening more and more.Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problemAfghanistan is for so many of us in the world.India doesn't have a military mission there.You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?One simple fact:you couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.Why? Because that was the momentwhen the Indian television soap opera,"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.Every Afghan family wanted to watch it.They had to suspend functions at 8:30.Weddings were reported to be interruptedso guests could cluster around the T.V. set,and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch --so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency --about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,any moving part they could find, at 8:30,because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,"Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi."(Laughter)That's soft power. And that is what India is developingthrough the "E" part of TED:its own entertainment industry.The same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples --but it's true of our music, of our dance,of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurantssince I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North Americaand not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.But, today in Britain, for example,Indian restaurants in Britainemploy more people than the coal mining,ship building and iron and steel industries combined.So the empire can strike back.(Applause)But, with this increasing awareness of India,with you and with I, and so on,with tales like Afghanistan,comes something vital in the information era,the sense that in today's worldit's not the side of the bigger army that wins,it's the country that tells a better story that prevails.And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.as a student in the mid '70s,I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewherespeak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technologywith the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.I had a friend, a history major like me,who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,by an anxiously perspiring European saying,"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?"(Laughter)We've gone from the image of India asland of fakirs lying on beds of nails,and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,computer wizards, software gurus.But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.But, there is something more substantive to that.The story rests on a fundamental platformof political pluralism.It's a civilizational story to begin with.Because India has been an open society for millennia.India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first templeby the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.In fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas,landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state,somewhere around 52 A.D.,he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.And to this day remains the only Jewish diasporain the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountereda single incident of anti-semitism.(Applause)That's the Indian story.Islam came peacefully to the south,slightly more differently complicated history in the north.But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting populationkeeps growing by 20 million a year.But, the fact isthat the last elections, five years ago,gave the world extraordinary phenomenonof an election being won by a woman political leaderof Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,to be sworn in as Prime Ministerby a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,in a country 81 percent Hindu.(Applause)This is India, and of course it's all the more strikingbecause it was four years later that we all applaudedthe U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,more than 220 years of free and fair elections,which took till last year to elect a president or a vice presidentwho wasn't white, male or Christian.So, maybe -- oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon --and he is male, but he isn't white.All the others have been all those three.(Laughter)All his predecessors have been all those three,and that's the point I was trying to make.(Laughter)But, the issue isthat when I talked about that example,it's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.Because ultimately, that electoral outcomehad nothing to do with the rest of the world.It was essentially India being itself.And ultimately, it seems to me,that always works better than propaganda.Governments aren't very good at telling stories.But people see a society for what it is,and that, it seems to me, is what ultimatelywill make a difference in today's information era,in today's TED age.So India now is no longerthe nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,we've every religion know to mankind,with the possible exception of Shintoism,though that has some Hindu elements somewhere.We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.And those of you who cashed your money heremight be surprised to see how many scripts there areon the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.We've got all of that.We don't even have geography uniting us,because the natural geography of the subcontinentframed by the mountains and the sea was hackedby the partition with Pakistan in 1947.In fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,because the name "India" comes from the river Indus,which flows in Pakistan.But, the whole point is that Indiais the nationalism of an idea.It's the idea of an ever-ever-land,emerging from an ancient civilization,united by a shared history,but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.And it's the nationalism of an idea thatessentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,and still rally around a consensus.And the consensus is of a very simple principle,that in a diverse plural democracy like Indiayou don't really have to agree on everything all the time,so long as you agree on the ground rulesof how you will disagree.The great success story of India,a country that so many learned scholars and journalistsassumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.And I do want to make the pointthat if there is anything worth celebrating about India,it isn't military muscle, economic power.All of that is necessary,but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.We can't really be both of those.We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with thehardware of development,the ports, the roads, the airports,all the infrastructural things we need to do,and the software of development,the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in Indiato be able to have a couple of square meals a day,to be able to send his or her childrento a decent school,and to aspire to work a jobthat will give them opportunities in their livesthat can transform themselves.But, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.But, it's all taking place in an open society,in a rich and diverse and plural civilization,in one that is determined to liberate and fulfillthe creative energies of its people.That's why India belongs at TED,and that's why TED belongs in India.Thank you very much.(Applause)

To understand the business of mythologyand what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do,you have to hear a storyof Ganesha,the elephant-headed godwho is the scribe of storytellers,and his brother,the athletic warlord of the gods,Kartikeya.The two brothers one day decided to go on a race,three times around the world.Kartikeya leapt on his peacockand flew around the continentsand the mountains and the oceans.He went around once,he went around twice,he went around thrice.But his brother, Ganesha,simply walked around his parentsonce, twice, thrice,and said, "I won.""How come?" said Kartikeya.And Ganesha said,"You went around 'the world.'I went around 'my world.'"What matters more?If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,'you understand the difference between logos and mythos.'The world' is objective,logical, universal, factual,scientific.'My world' is subjective.It's emotional. It's personal.It's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams.It is the belief system that we carry.It's the myth that we live in.'The world' tells us how the world functions,how the sun rises,how we are born.'My world' tells us why the sun rises,why we were born.Every culture is trying to understand itself:"Why do we exist?"And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life,its own customized version of mythology.Culture is a reaction to nature,and this understanding of our ancestorsis transmitted generation from generationin the form of stories, symbols and rituals,which are always indifferent to rationality.And so, when you study it, you realizethat different people of the worldhave a different understanding of the world.Different people see things differently --different viewpoints.There is my world and there is your world,and my world is always better than your world,because my world, you see, is rationaland yours is superstition.Yours is faith.Yours is illogical.This is the root of the clash of civilizations.It took place, once, in 326 B.C.on the banks of a river called the Indus,now in Pakistan.This river lends itself to India's name.India. Indus.Alexander, a young Macedonian,met there what he called a "gymnosophist,"which means "the naked, wise man."We don't know who he was.Perhaps he was a Jain monk,like Bahubali over here,the Gomateshwara Bahubaliwhose image is not far from Mysore.Or perhaps he was just a yogiwho was sitting on a rock, staring at the skyand the sun and the moon.Alexander asked, "What are you doing?"and the gymnosophist answered,"I'm experiencing nothingness."Then the gymnosophist asked,"What are you doing?"and Alexander said, "I am conquering the world."And they both laughed.Each one thought that the other was a fool.The gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world?It's pointless."And Alexander thought,"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?What a waste of a life."To understand this difference in viewpoints,we have to understandthe subjective truth of Alexander --his myth, and the mythology that constructed it.Alexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotletold him the story of Homer's "Iliad."They told him of a great hero called Achilles,who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,but when he withdrew from the battle,defeat was inevitable."Achilles was a man who could shape history,a man of destiny,and this is what you should be, Alexander."That's what he heard."What should you not be?You should not be Sisyphus,who rolls a rock up a mountain all dayonly to find the boulder rolled down at night.Don't live a life which is monotonous,mediocre, meaningless.Be spectacular! --like the Greek heroes,like Jason, who went across the seawith the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece.Be spectacular like Theseus,who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur.When you play in a race, win! --because when you win, the exhilaration of victoryis the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods."Because, you see, the Greeks believedyou live only once,and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx.And if you have lived an extraordinary life,you will be welcomed to Elysium,or what the French call "Champs-Élysées" --(Laughter) --the heaven of the heroes.But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard.He heard a very different story.He heard of a man called Bharat,after whom India is called Bhārata.Bharat also conquered the world.And then he went to the top-most peakof the greatest mountain of the center of the worldcalled Meru.And he wanted to hoist his flag to say,"I was here first."But when he reached the mountain peak,he found the peak covered with countless flagsof world-conquerors before him,each one claiming "'I was here first' ...that's what I thought until I came here."And suddenly, in this canvas of infinity,Bharat felt insignificant.This was the mythology of the gymnosophist.You see, he had heroes, like Ram -- Raghupati Ramand Krishna, Govinda Hari.But they were not two characters on two different adventures.They were two lifetimes of the same hero.When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins.When Ram dies, Krishna is born.When Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram.You see, the Indians also had a riverthat separates the land of the living from the land of the dead.But you don't cross it once.You go to and fro endlessly.It was called the Vaitarani.You go again and again and again.Because, you see,nothing lasts forever in India, not even death.And so, you have these grand ritualswhere great images of mother goddesses are builtand worshiped for 10 days ...And what do you do at the end of 10 days?You dunk it in the river.Because it has to end.And next year, she will come back.What goes around always comes around,and this rule applies not just to man,but also the gods.You see, the godshave to come back again and again and againas Ram, as Krishna.Not only do they live infinite lives,but the same life is lived infinite timestill you get to the point of it all."Groundhog Day."(Laughter)Two different mythologies.Which is right?Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world.One linear, one cyclical.One believes this is the one and only life.The other believes this is one of many lives.And so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one.So, the value of his life was the sum totalof his achievements.The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity.So, no matter what he did,it was always zero.And I believe it is this mythological paradigmthat inspired Indian mathematiciansto discover the number zero.Who knows?And that brings us to the mythology of business.If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior,if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior,then it was bound to influence the business they were in.You see, what is businessbut the result of how the market behavesand how the organization behaves?And if you look at cultures around the world,all you have to do is understand the mythologyand you will see how they behave and how they do business.Take a look.If you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world,you will see an obsession with binary logic,absolute truth, standardization,absoluteness, linear patterns in design.But if you look at cultures which have cyclicaland based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic,with opinion,with contextual thinking,with everything is relative, sort of --(Laughter)mostly.(Laughter)You look at art. Look at the ballerina,how linear she is in her performance.And then look at the Indian classical dancer,the Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer,curvaceous.(Laughter)And then look at business.Standard business model:vision, mission, values, processes.Sounds very much like the journey throughthe wilderness to the promised land,with the commandments held by the leader.And if you comply, you will go to heaven.But in India there is no "the" promised land.There are many promised lands,depending on your station in society,depending on your stage of life.You see, businesses are not run as institutions,by the idiosyncrasies of individuals.It's always about taste.It's always about my taste.You see, Indian music, for example,does not have the concept of harmony.There is no orchestra conductor.There is one performer standing there, and everybody follows.And you can never replicate that performance twice.It is not about documentation and contract.It's about conversation and faith.It's not about compliance. It's about setting,getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules --just look at your Indian people around here,you'll see them smile; they know what it is.(Laughter)And then look at people who have done business in India,you'll see the exasperation on their faces.(Laughter)(Applause)You see, this is what India is today. The ground realityis based on a cyclical world view.So, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse,chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable.And people are okay with it.And then globalization is taking place.The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in.Which is rooted in one-life culture.And a clash is going to take place,like on the banks of the Indus.It is bound to happen.I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor.I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why.I love mythology too much.I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study.So, I had to teach it to myself.And mythology does not pay, well, until now.(Laughter)So, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry.And I worked in the healthcare industry.And I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy,and a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy.I even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics.And I would see the exasperationbetween my American and European colleagues,when they were dealing with India.Example: Please tell us the processto invoice hospitals.Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.(Laughter)How do you parameterize "mostly"?How do you put it in a nice little software? You can't.I would give my viewpoints to people.But nobody was interested in listening to it,you see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group.You see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar.And there are more than 200 formats,across 50 cities and towns of India.And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets.And he knew very intuitively,that best practices,developed in Japan and China and Europe and Americawill not work in India.He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does.He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.So, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said,"All I want to do is align belief."Sounds so simple.But belief is not measurable.You can't measure it. You can't manage it.So, how do you construct belief?How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness.Even if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious.So, I tried to work on the standard model of culture,which is, develop stories, symbols and rituals.And I will share one of the rituals with you.You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.Hindus don't have the concept of commandments.So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life.So, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God.So, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God.You want to see God.And you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes,large unblinking eyes,sometimes made of silver,so they look at you.Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seekis divine empathy."Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad."(Laughter)"Why did I do the setting,why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please."And based on this, we created a ritual for leaders.After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store,we blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders,the customer, his family, his team, his boss.You read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys,and then you remove the blindfold.And invariably, you see a tear,because the penny has dropped.He realizes that to succeed,he does not have to be a "professional,"he does not have to cut out his emotions,he has to include all these peoplein his world to succeed, to make them happy,to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.The customer is happy, because the customer is God.That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters,behavior will happen, business will happen.And it has.So, then we come back to Alexanderand to the gymnosophist.And everybody asks me, "Which is the better way, this way or that way?"And it's a very dangerous question,because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.So, I will not answer the question.What I will give you is an Indian answer,the Indian head-shake.(Laughter)(Applause)Depending on the context,depending on the outcome,choose your paradigm.You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions.They are cultural creations,not natural phenomena.And so the next time you meet someone, a stranger,one request:Understand that you live in the subjective truth,and so does he.Understand it.And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.You will discover that within infinite mythslies the eternal truth.Who sees it all?Varuna has but a thousand eyes.Indra, a hundred.You and I, only two.Thank you. Namaste.(Applause)

A few years ago, my eyes were openedto the dark side of the construction industry.In 2006, young Qatari studentstook me to go and see the migrant worker camps.And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapersin the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildingsis the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.1.1 million of them.Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankanand Nepalese, these laborers risk everythingto make money for their families back home.They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there.And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water,no air conditioning, and their passports taken away.While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities,99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector,and so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable.Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged,but the numbers are simply overwhelming.In August 2008,UAE public officials notedthat 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor campshad violated minimum health and fire safety regulations.And last summer, more than 10,000 workersprotested for the non-payment of wages,for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing.And then the financial collapse happened.When the contractors have gone bust,as they've been overleveraged like everyone else,the difference is everything goes missing,documentation, passports,and tickets home for these workers.Currently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned.There is no way back home.And there is no way, and no proof of arrival.These are the boom-and-bust refugees.The question is, as a building professional,as an architect, an engineer, as a developer,if you know this is going on,as we go to the sights every single week,are you complacent or complicitin the human rights violations?So let's forget your environmental footprint.Let's think about your ethical footprint.What good is itto build a zero-carbon, energy efficient complex,when the labor producing this architectural gemis unethical at best?Now, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road.But, quite frankly, on this issue,there is no other road.So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse.And that as we worry about our next job in the office,the next design that we can get, to keep our workers.Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work.Thank you.(Applause)

The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.Which is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting.They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.And I go on the podium.You know, this little office of the conductor.Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,with a lot of space.And in front of all that noise,you do a very small gesture.Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.Noise becomes music.And this is fantastic. And it's so temptingto think that it's all about me.(Laughter)All those great people here, virtuosos,they make noise, they need me to do that.Not really. If it were that,I would just save you the talk,and teach you the gesture.So you could go out to the worldand do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.Let's look at the first video.I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.(Music)Was that nice?So that was a sort of a success.Now, who should we thank for the success?I mean, obviously the orchestra musiciansplaying beautifully,the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.They don't often even look at the conductor.Then you have the clapping audience, yeah,actually taking part in doing the music.You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feastthat you will ever get in Vienna.(Laughter)Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to saythat, "Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts."(Laughter)So that's a sort of a tradition.But Viennese audiences do not do that.Here they go out of their regular, just to be part of that,to become part of the orchestra, and that's great.You know, audiences like you, yeah,make the event.But what about the conductor? What can you saythe conductor was doing, actually?Um, he was happy.And I often show this to senior management.People get annoyed."You come to work. How come you're so happy?"Something must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness.And I think the happiness, the important thing is this happinessdoes not come fromonly his own story and his joy of the music.The joy is about enabling other people's storiesto be heard at the same time.You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.You have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah.You have the stories of the individualsin the orchestra and in the audience.And then you have other stories, unseen.People who build this wonderful concert hall.People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.And all those stories are being heard at the same time.This is the true experience of a live concert.That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?And not all conductors do just that.Let's see somebody else, a great conductor.Riccardo Muti, please.(Music)Yeah, that was very short, but you could seeit's a completely different figure. Right?He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?So clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.Can we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second?Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.Okay? Ready?Audience: ♫ Aaaaaaah ... ♫Itay Talgam: Come on, with me. If you do it without meI feel even more redundant than I already feel.So please, wait for the conductor.Now look at me. "Aaaaaah," and I stop you. Let's go.Audience: ♫ ... Aaaaaaaah ... ♫(Laughter)Itay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.(Laughter)But ... There is a vacancy for a ...But -- (Laughter)-- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.Now what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ...(Laughter)And then -- sort of -- (Laughter)So not only the instruction is clear,but also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you.(Laughter)So, does it work? Yes, it works --to a certain point.When Muti is asked, "Why do you conduct like this?"He says, "I'm responsible."Responsible in front of him.No he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart,which is -- (Laughter) -- like a third seat from the center.(Laughter)So he says, "If I'm --(Applause)if I'm responsible for Mozart,this is going to be the only story to be told.It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it."And you know what happened to Muti?Three years ago he got a letter signed byall 700 employees of La Scala,musical employees, I mean the musicians,saying, "You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign."(Laughter)"Why? Because you don't let us develop.You're using us as instruments, not as partners.And our joy of music, etc., etc. ..."So he had to resign. Isn't that nice?(Laughter)He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy.Well, can you do it with less control,or with a different kind of control?Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.(Music)I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.It's not true. When he was a young manof about 30, he wrote what he called"The Ten Commandments for Conductors."The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concertit means that you must have done something wrong.That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better.It says: Never look at the trombones --it only encourages them.(Laughter)So, the whole idea is really to letit happen by itself.Do not interfere.But how does it happen? Did you seehim turning pages in the score?Now, either he is senile,and doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying,"Come on guys. You have to play by the book.So it's not about my story. It's not about your story.It's only the execution of the written music,no interpretation."Interpretation is the real story of the performer.So, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control.Let's see another super-conductor,a German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.(Music)What's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed.Did you see the hands?Did you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice.Once like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.And then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay?Like Muti. You ready? Because Muti ...(Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it.Audience: (Claps)Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again.Audience: (Claps)Itay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained,let me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.Audience: (Claps) (Laughter)Itay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter)Because you didn't know when to play.Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonicdoesn't know when to play.(Laughter)But I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism.This is a German orchestra, yes?They look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.(Laughter)"Do you understand what this guy wants?"And after doing that,they really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestralead the whole ensemble in playing together.And when Karajan is asked about ithe actually says, "Yes, the worst damageI can do to my orchestrais to give them a clear instruction.Because that wouldprevent the ensemble, the listening to each otherthat is needed for an orchestra."Now that's great. What about the eyes?Why are the eyes closed?There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.And he cues in a flute player like this.The guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter)"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"What do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start?Oh yeah. He says, "You start when you can't stand it anymore."(Laughter)Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.It's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head.And you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressurebecause I don't give you instruction,and yet, you have to guess my mind.So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yetvery firm control.Can we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go backto the first conductor we've seen:Carlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please.(Music)(Laughter) Yeah.Well, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way?No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.When he does this, it's not,"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix,smash it on the floor." It's not that.He says, "This is the gesture of the music.I'm opening a space for youto put in another layerof interpretation."That is another story.But how does it really work togetherif it doesn't give them instructions?It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah?You're not really given any instructions,but the forces of the process itself keep you in place.That's what he does.The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.And that's what makes them into partners.You have the plan in your head.You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.But here and there and that. You know what to do.And you become a partner building the rollercoaster,yeah, with sound,as you actually take the ride.This is very exciting for those players.They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.(Laughter)It is very tiring. Yeah?But it's the best music making, like this.But of course it's not only about motivationand giving them a lot of physical energy.You also have to be very professional.And look again at this Kleiber.Can we have the next video, quickly?You'll see what happens when there is a mistake.(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.(Music)And now there is a trumpet player whodoes something not exactly the way it should be done.Go along with the video. Look.See, second time for the same player.(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.(Laughter)"Wait for me after the concert.I have a short notice to give you."You know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important.But authority is not enough to make people your partners.Let's see the next video, please. See what happens here.You might be surprised having seen Kleiberas such a hyperactive guy.He's conducting Mozart.(Music)The whole orchestra is playing.(Music)Now something else.(Music)See? He is there 100 percent,but not commanding, not telling what to do.Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing.(Music)Another solo now. See what you can pick up from this.(Music)Look at the eyes.Okay. You see that?First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.It's not feedback. It's an "Mmmm ..." Yeah, it comes from here.So that's a good thing.And the second thing isit's about actually being in control,but in a very special way.When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes,going from here? (Singing)You know what happens? Gravitation is no more.Kleiber not only creates a process,but also creates the conditions in the worldin which this process takes place.So again, the oboe playeris completely autonomousand therefore happy and proud of his work,and creative and all of that.And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.So control is no longer a zero-sum game.You have this control. You have this control. And all you put together,in partnership, brings about the best music.So Kleiber is about process.Kleiber is about conditions in the world.But you need to have process and content to create the meaning.Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.Since he was a great teacher,Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please.(Music)Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one.(Laughter)Did you see Lenny's face?You know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain.And you're playing a painful sound.And you look at Lenny and he's suffering.But not in a way that you want to stop.It's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.(Laughter)But you can see the music on his face.You can see the baton left his hand. No more baton.Now it's about you, the player,telling the story.Now it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story.And even briefly, you become the storytellerto which the community, the whole community, listens to.And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?Now, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together,and maybe some others,you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.My friend Peter says,"If you love something, give it away." So, please.(Music)(Applause)

Thirteen trillion dollars in wealthhas evaporated over the course of the last two years.We've questioned the future of capitalism.We've questioned the financial industry.We've looked at our government oversight.We've questioned where we're going.And yet, at the same time, this very well may bea seminal moment in American history,an opportunity for the consumerto actually take control and guide usto a new trajectory in America.I'm calling this The Great Unwind.And the idea is a simple, simple idea,which is the fact that the consumerhas moved from a state of anxiety to action.Consumers who represent 72 percentof the GDP of America have actually started,just like banks and just like businesses,to de-leverage, to unwind their leverage,in daily life, to remove themselvesfrom the liability and riskthat presents itself as we move forward.So, to understand this -- and I'm going to stress this --it's not about the consumer being in retreat.The consumer is empowered.In order to understand this, we're going to step back and looka little bit at what's happened over the course of the last year and a half.So, if you've been gone, this is the easy CliffsNoteson what's happened in the economy. Okay?(Laughter)Unemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down.Commodity prices are like this.If you're a mom trying to manage a budget,and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer,and it's somewhere between 50 and 70,do you plan vacations? How do you buy?What is your strategy in your household?Will the bailout work? We have national debt, Detroit,currency valuations, healthcare, all these issues facing us.You put them all together, you mix them up in a bouillabaisse,and you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time-bomb.In fact, let's go back and look at what caused this crisis,because the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives,actually contributed a large part to the problem.This is something I call the 50-20 paradox.It took us 50 yearsto reach annual savings ratingsof almost 10 percent. 50 years.Do you know what this was right here?This was World War II. Do you know why savings was so high?There was nothing to buy, unless you wanted to buy some rivets. Right?So, what happened though, over the course of the last 20 years --we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate.Because we binged. We bought extra-large cars,supersized everything, we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome.All these things together basically createda factor where the consumer sort of drove usheadlong into the crisis that we face today.The personal debt-to-income ratiobasically went from 65 percentto 135 percent in the span of about 15 years.So consumers got overleveraged.And of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government.This is an absolutely staggering chart.It shows leverage, trended out from 1919 to 2009.And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenonof the fact that we are actuallystepping forth and basically leveragingfuture education, future children in our households.So if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout,what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills,first of all, 360,000 dollarsis about the size of a five-foot-four guy.But if you stack it up, you just see this amazing, staggering amount ofdollars that have been put into the systemto fund and bail us out.So this is the first 315 billion.But I read this fact the other day, that one trillion secondsequals 32 thousand years,so if you think about that, the context, the casualnesswith which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here, and trillion there,we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage.However, consumers have moved.They are taking responsibility.What we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate.In fact, 11 straight months of savings have happenedsince the beginning of the crisis.We are working our way back up to that 10 percent.Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years,almost a 3.7 percent decline.Visa now reports that more people are using debit cardsthan they're using credit cards.So we're starting to pay for things with money that we have.And we're starting to be much more carefulabout how we save and how we invest.But that's not really the whole story.Because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation.And you've got to admit, over the course of the last year and a half,consumers have been doing some pretty weird things.It's been pretty staggering, what we've lived through.If you take into account 80 percent of all Americanswere born after World War II,this is essentially our Depression.And so, as a result, some crazy things have happened.I'll give you some examples. Lets talk about dentists,vasectomies, guns and shark attacks. Okay?(Laughter)Dentists report molars,you know, people grinding their teeth, coming inand reporting the fact that they've had stress.And so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced.Guns, gun sales, according to the FBI,who does background checks, are up almost 25 percent since January.Vasectomies are up 48 percent,according to the Cornell institute.And lastly, but a very good point,hopefully not related to the former point I just made,which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003.Does anybody know why?No one is at the beach. So there is a bright side to everything.But seriously, what we see happening,and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat,is that this is a tremendous opportunityfor the consumer who drove us into this recessionto lead us right back out.And what I mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumptionto mindful consumption. Right?If you think about the last three decades,the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '90s,to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade,but the one thing that has been holding them back is the ability to discriminate.By restricting their demand, consumers can actuallyalign their values with their spending,and drive capitalism and businessto not just be about more, but be about better.We're going to explain that right now.Based on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator,proprietary tool of VML and Young &amp; Rubicam,we set out to understand what's been happening in the crisiswith the consumer marketplace.We found a couple of really interesting things.We're going to go through four value-shifts that we seedriving new consumer behaviors,that offer new management principles.The first cultural value shift that we see is this tendencytoward something we call liquid life.This is the movement from Americans defining their successon having things to having liquidity,because the less excess that you have around you,the more nimble and fleet of foot you are.As a result, déclassé consumption is in.Déclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending moneyfrivolously makes you look a little bit anti-fashion.The management principle is dollars and cents.So let's look at some examples of this déclasséconsumption that falls out of this value.First things is we see something must be happening whenP. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.(Laughter)But seriously, we also have this phenomenonon Madison Avenue and in other places,where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiqueswith ordinary, sort of genericpaper bags to hide the brand purchases.We see high-end haggling in fashion today.High-end haggling for luxury and real estate.We also see just a relaxing of ego,and sort of a dismantling of artifice.This is a story on the yacht clubthat's all basically blue collar.Blue-collar yacht club, where you can join the yacht club,but you've got to work in the boat yard,as sort of condition of membership.We also see the trend towardtourism that's a little bit more low key. Right?Agritourism, going to vineyards and going to farms.And then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents.What businesses can do to connectwith these new mindsets is really interesting.A couple things that are kind of cool.One is that Frito-Lay figured out this liquidity thingwith their consumer.They found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month,less at the end of the month. So what they didis they started to change their packaging.Larger packs at the beginning of the month, smaller packagingat the end of the month.Really interestingly, too, was the San Francisco Giants.They've just instituted dynamic pricing.So it takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups,to the weather, to the team records,in setting prices for the consumer.Another quick example of these types of movements isthe rise of Zynga.Zynga has risen on the consumer's desireto not want to be locked in to fixed-cost.Again, this theme is about variable cost, variable living.So micropayments have become huge.And lastly, some people are using Huluactually as a device to get rid of their cable bill.So, really clever ideas therethat are kind of being taken ahold and marketers are starting to understand.The second of the four valuesis this movement toward ethics and fair play.We see that play itself out with empathy and respect.The consumer is demanding it.And, as a result, businesses must providenot only value, but values.Increasingly, consumers are looking at the culture of the company,looking for their conduct in the marketplace.So, what we see with empathy and respect, lots of really hopeful thingsthat have come out of this recession.And I'll give you a few examples.One is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods,and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system.Also a wonderful byproduct of sort of a really lousy thing,which has been unemployment, is a rise involunteerism that's been noted in our country.We also see the phenomenon --some of you may have "boomerang kids" --these are "boomerang alumni,"where universities are actually reconnecting with alumniin helping them with jobs, sharing skills and retraining.We also talked about character and professionalism.We had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City, you know, in January,and suddenly Sully has become a key name on Babycenter.(Laughter)So, from a value and values standpoint,what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways.Microsoft is doing something wonderful.They are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with I.T. training,using their existing infrastructure to do something good.Also a really interesting company is Gore-Tex.Gore-Tex is all about personal accountabilityof their management and their employees,to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses.But they also talk about the fact thattheir executives, all of their expense reportsare put onto their company intranet for everyone to see.Complete transparency.Think twice before you have that bottle of wine.The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerismis about durable living.We're seeing on our data that consumers are realizingthis is a marathon, not a sprint.They are digging in. And they're looking for ways to extract valueout of every purchase that they make.Witness the fact that Americans are holding on to their carslonger than ever before,9.4 years on average, in March. A record.We also see the fact that libraries have becomea huge resource for America.Did you know that 68 percent of Americansnow carry a library card?The highest percentage ever in our nation's history.So what you see in this trend is alsothe accumulation of knowledge.Continuing education is up.Everything is focused on betterment, and training,and development and moving forward.We also see a big DIY movement.I was fascinated to learn that 30 percentof all homes in America are actually built by owners.That includes cottages and the like. But 30 percent.So, people are getting their hands dirty. They are rolling up their sleeves.They want these skills.We see that with the phenomenon of raising backyardhens and chickens and ducks. And when you work out the math,they say it doesn't work, but the principle is therethat it's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself.And then we look at the High Line in New York City,an excellent use of reimaginingexisting infrastructure for something good, which isa brand new park in New York City.So, what brands can do, and companies,is pay dividends to consumers,be a brand that lasts,offer transparency, promise you're going to be there beyond today's sale.Perfect example of that is Patagonia.Patagonia's Footprint Chronicles basicallygoes through and tracks every product that they make,and gives you social responsibility,and helps you understand the ethicsthat are behind the product that they make.Another great example is Fidelity.Rather than instant cash-back rewards on your credit or debit purchases,this is about 529 rewardsfor your student education.Or the interesting company SunRun.I love this company. They've created a consumer collectivewhere they put solar panels on householdsand create a consumer-based utility,where the electricity that they generate is basicallypumped back out into the marketplace.So, it's a consumer driven co-op.So, the fourth sort of post-crisis consumerism that we seeis this movement about return to the fold.It's incredibly important right now.Trust is not parceled out, as we all know.It's now about connecting to your communities,connecting to your social networks.In my book I talked about the fact that 72 percentof people trust what other people sayabout a brand or a company, versus 15 percent on advertising.So, in that respect,cooperative consumerism has really taken off.This is about consumers working togetherto get what they want out of the marketplace.Let's look at a couple of quick examples.The artisanal movement is huge.Everything about locally derived products and services,supporting your local neighborhoods,whether it's cheeses, wines and other products.Also this rise of local currencies.Realizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment,you're doing business with people you trust,in your local markets.So, this rise of this sort of local currencyis another really interesting phenomenon.And then they did a recent reportI thought was fascinating.They actually started, in certain communities in the United States,start to publish people's electricity usage.And what they found out is when that was available for public record,the people's electricity usage in those communities dropped.Then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling,which is the whole phenomenon of consumersorganizing togetherto buy meat from organic farmsthat they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled.And then there is this other really interesting movementthat's happened in California, which is about carrot mobs.The traditional thing would be to boycott right?Have a stick? Well why not have a carrot?So these are consumers organizing, pooling their resourcesto incentify companies to do good.And then we look at what companies can do.This is all the opportunity about being a community organizer.You have to realize that you can't fight and control this.You actually need to organize it.You need to harness it. You need to give it meaning.And there is lots of really interesting examples herethat we see.First is just the rise of the fact thatZagat's has actually moved out ofand diversified from rating restaurants,into actually rating healthcare.So what credentials does Zagat's have?Well, they have a lot, because it's their network of people. Right?So that becomes a very powerful force for themto make their brand more elastic.Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.This Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck. Right?It's a moving truck through L.A., and the only way you can find itis through Twitter.Or you look at Johnson &amp; Johnson's Momversations.A phenomenal blog that's been built up.Where J&amp;J basically is tapping intothe power of mommy bloggers,allowing them to basically create a forumwhere they can communicate and they can connect.And it's also become a very, very valuablesort of advertising revenue for J&amp;J as well.This plus the fact that you've gotphenomenal work from CEOsfrom Ford to Zappos, connecting on Twitter,creating an open environment,allowing their employees to be part of the process,rather than hidden behind walls.You see this rising force in sort oftotal transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt,all because the consumer is demanding it.So, when we look at this and we step back,what I believe is that the crisis that exists todayis definitely real.It's been tremendously powerful for consumers.But, at the same time, this is also a tremendous opportunity.And the Chinese character for crisisis actually the same side of the same coin.Crisis equals opportunity.What we're seeing with consumers right nowis the ability for them to actuallylead us forward out of this recession.So, we believe that values-driven spendingwill force capitalism to be better.It will drive innovation.It will make longer-lasting products. It willcreate better, more intuitive customer service.It will give us the opportunity to connect with companiesthat share the values that we share.So, when we look back and step out at thisand see the beginning of these trendsthat we're seeing in our data,we see a very hopeful picture for the future of America.Thank you very much.(Applause)



julian_treasure_the_4_ways_sound_affects_us
1464366

Over the next five minutes,my intention is to transform your relationship with sound.Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental,and much of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise)We stand on street corners, shouting over noise like this,and pretending that it doesn't exist.Well, this habit of suppressing sound has meant that ourrelationship with sound has become largely unconscious.There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time,and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today.First is physiological. (Loud alarm clocks)Sorry about that. I've just given you a shot of cortisol, your fight/flight hormone.Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time,but also your breathing, your heart rate -- which I just also did --and your brainwaves.It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it.This is surf. (Ocean waves)It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute.Most people find that very soothing,and, interestingly, 12 cycles per minuteis roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human.There is a deep resonance with being at rest.We also associate it with being stress-freeand on holiday.The second way in which sound affects you is psychological.Music is the most powerful form of sound that we knowthat affects our emotional state. (Albinoni's Adagio)This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sadif I leave it on.Music is not the only kind of sound, however, which affects your emotions.Natural sound can do that too.Birdsong, for example, is a sound which most peoplefind reassuring. (Birds chirping)There is a reason for that. Over hundreds of thousands of yearswe've learned that when the birds are singing, things are safe.It's when they stop you need to be worried.The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively.You can't understand two people talking at once ("If you're listening to this version of")("me you're on the wrong track.") or in this case one person talking twice.Try and listen to the other one. ("You have to choose which me you're going to listen to.")We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input,which is why noise like this -- (Office noise) --is extremely damaging for productivity.If you have to work in an open-plan office like this,your productivity is greatly reduced.And whatever number you're thinking of, it probably isn't as bad as this.(Ominous music)You are one third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.And I have a tip for you. If you have to work in spaces like that,carry headphones with you, with a soothing sound like birdsong.Put them on and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be.The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally.With all that other stuff going on, it would be amazingif our behavior didn't change.(Techno music inside a car) So, ask yourself: Is this person ever going to driveat a steady 28 miles per hour? I don't think so.At the simplest, you move away from unpleasant soundand towards pleasant sounds.So if I were to play this -- (Jackhammer) --for more than a few seconds, you'd feel uncomfortable;for more than a few minutes, you'd be leaving the room in droves.For people who can't get away from noise like that,it's extremely damaging for their health.And that's not the only thing that bad sound damages.Most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental, and even hostile,and it has a dramatic effect on sales.For those of you who are retailers, you may want to look awaybefore I show this slide.They are losing up to 30 percent of their businesswith people leaving shops faster, or just turning around on the door.We all have done it, leaving the areabecause the sound in there is so dreadful.I want to spend just a moment talking aboutthe model that we've developed, which allows us to start at the topand look at the drivers of sound, analyze the soundscapeand then predict the four outcomes I've just talked about.Or start at the bottom,and say what outcomes do we want,and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect.At last we've got some science we can apply.And we're in the business of designing soundscapes.Just a word on music. Music is the most powerful sound there is,often inappropriately deployed.It's powerful for two reasons. You recognize it fast,and you associate it very powerfully.I'll give you two examples. (First chord of The Beatles' "A Hard Day's Night")Most of you recognize that immediately.The younger, maybe not. (Laughter)(First two notes of "Jaws" theme) And most of you associate that with something!Now, those are one-second samples of music.Music is very powerful. And unfortunatelyit's veneering commercial spaces, often inappropriately.I hope that's going to change over the next few years.Let me just talk about brands for a moment,because some of you run brands. Every brand is out theremaking sound right now.There are eight expressions of a brand in sound.They are all important. And every brand needs to have guidelines at the center.I'm glad to say that is starting to happen now.(Intel ad jingle)You all recognize that one. (Nokia ringtone) This is themost-played tune in the world today.1.8 billion times a day, that tune is played.And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing.Just leave you with four golden rules, for those of you who run businesses,for commercial sound.First, make it congruent,pointing in the same direction as your visual communication.That increases impact by over 1,100 percent.If your sound is pointing the opposite direction, incongruent,you reduce impact by 86 percent.That's an order of magnitude, up or down.This is important.Secondly, make it appropriate to the situation.Thirdly, make it valuable. Give people something with the sound.Don't just bombard them with stuff.And, finally, test and test it again.Sound is complex. There are many countervailing influences.It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens.So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness.If you're listening consciously,you can take control of the sound around you.It's good for your health. It's good for your productivity.If we all do that we move to a statethat I like to think will be sound living in the world.I'm going to leave you with a little bit more birdsong. (Birds chirping)I recommend at least five minutes a day, but there is no maximum dose.Thank you for lending me your ears today.(Applause)



rory_sutherland_life_lessons_from_an_ad_man
2745167

This is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sisterthat pays all the bills.It's held every two years in Burma.And I particularly remember a really good speechby Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.(Laughter)But, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business,that what we create in advertising,which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value,you might call it badge value, subjective value,intangible value of some kind --gets rather a bad rap.If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the futurewhere there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.You can either live in a world which is poorer,which people in general don't like.Or you can live in a world where actually intangible valueconstitutes a greater part of overall value,that actually intangible value, in many waysis a very, very fine substitutefor using up labor or limited resourcesin the creation of things.Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.The question was given to a bunch of engineers,about 15 years ago, "How do we make the journey to Paris better?"And they came up with a very good engineering solution,which was to spend six billion poundsbuilding completely new tracksfrom London to the coast,and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journeymerely to make it shorter.Now what is the hedonic opportunity coston spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion.What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top maleand female supermodels,pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrusfor the entire duration of the journey.(Laughter)(Applause)Now, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.(Laughter)Now, here is another naive advertising man's question again.And this shows that engineers,medical people, scientific people,have an obsession with solving the problems of reality,when actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealthin society, most problems are actually problems of perception.So I'll ask you another question.What on earth is wrong with placebos?They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.They work extraordinarily well.They have no side effects,or if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.(Laughter)So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blogby Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,and actually produce placebo education.The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.It actually works by giving you the impressionthat you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane senseof unwarranted self-confidence,which then makes you very, very successful in later life.So, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.(Laughter)(Applause)But, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.How many problems of life can be solvedactually by tinkering with perception,rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy businessof actually trying to change reality?Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,but doing a bit of historical research,it seems to be Fredrick the Great.Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keenfor the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.And you get a far lower risk of famine,because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.The only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.And also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables --rather like contemporary Scottish people.(Laughter)So, actually, he tried making it compulsory.The Prussian peasantry said,"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing."There are even records of people being executedfor refusing to grow potatoes.So he tried plan B.He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potatoas a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.And he planted it in a royal potato patch,with guards who had instructionsto guard over it, night and day,but with secret instructions not to guard it very well.(Laughter)Now, 18th century peasants know that there is onepretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,it's worth stealing.Before long, there was a massive undergroundpotato-growing operation in Germany.What he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.It was an absolute masterpiece.I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said,"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk."Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,in Turkey, to modernize it.Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickbackand a hell of a lot of resistance.Ataturk was a lateral thinker.He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.(Laughter)(Applause)I can't verify that fully, but it does not matter.There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:All convicted child molestershave to drive a Porsche Cayenne.(Laughter)What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.Which is that, actually, first one,all value is actually relative.All value is perceived value.For those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja -- it's actually the Spanish for "orange juice."Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the pesoin Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendorsdecided to practice price discriminationto the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.As an advertising man, I have to admire that.But the first thing is that all value is subjective.Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.These funny signs that flash your speed at you,some of the new ones, on the bottom right,now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,to act as an emotional trigger.What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percentof the running cost of a conventional speed camera,but they prevent twice as many accidents.So, the bizarre thing, which is bafflingto conventional, classically trained economists,is that a weird little smiley facehas a better effect on changing your behaviorthan the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points.Tiny little behavioral economics detail:in Italy, penalty points go backwards.You start with 12 and they take them away.Because they found that loss aversionis a more powerful influence on people's behavior.In Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!"Not so in Italy.Another fantastic case of creating intangible valueto replace actual or material value, which remember, is what,after all, the environmental movement needs to be about:This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813.The wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French,were encouraged to give in all their jewelry.And it was replaced with replica jewelrymade of cast iron.Here's one: "Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813."The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence,the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussiawasn't made of gold or diamonds.It was made of cast iron.Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic valueof having gold jewelry. This actuallyhad symbolic value, badge value.It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.So, the modern equivalent would of course be this.(Laughter)But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare --there are opposite kind of thingswhere actually the value in them depends on them beingubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.Adam Smith talks about 18th century America,where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,it was almost a block in the economy in New England,because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money onwithout incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.It's perfectly possible to create these social pressureswhich lead to more egalitarian societies.What's also interesting, if you look at productsthat have a high componentof what you might call messaging value,a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:They are often quite egalitarian.In terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of somethingwhich replaces material value with symbolic value.Coca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos,and you may not like the Coca-Cola company,but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke.What Warhol said about Coke is, he said,"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United Statescan't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street."Now, that is, actually, when you think about it -- we take it for granted --it's actually a remarkable achievement,to produce something that's that democratic.Now, we basically have to change our views slightly.There is a basic view that real value involves making things,involves labor. It involves engineering.It involves limited raw materials.And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version.And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.It patently veers toward propaganda.However, what we do have nowis a much more variegated media ecosystemin which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.When I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhoodas translated into food.You had a monopoly supplier. On the left,you have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC.(Laughter)And on your right you have a dependent publicwhich is pathetically grateful for anything you give it.(Laughter)Nowadays, the user is actually involved.This is actually what's called, in the digital world, "user-generated content."Although it's called agriculture in the world of food.(Laughter)This is actually called a mash-up,where you take content that someone else has producedand you do something new with it.In the world of food we call it cooking.This is food 2.0,which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people.This is mobile food. British are very good at that.Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty,the pie, the sandwich.We invented the whole lot of them.We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food,but it's not very portable, generally.(Laughter)I only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich.He actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name.(Laughter)Finally, we have contextual communication.Now, the reason I show you Pernod -- it's only one example.Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.It tastes great within the borders of that country,but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.(Laughter)Unicum in Hungary, for example.The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina,which even tastes shite when you're in Greece.(Laughter)But so much communication now is contextualthat the capacity for actually nudging people,for giving them better information -- B.J. Fogg,at the University of Stanford, makes the pointthat actually the mobile phone is --He's invented the phrase, "persuasive technologies."He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,contextual, timely and immediate,is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.Now, if we have all these tools at our disposal,we simply have to ask the question,and Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.I'll give you one example.If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,put 50 dollars into your pension,you would save a lot more.The reason is that the interface fundamentally determinesthe behavior. Okay?Now, marketing has done a very, very good job of creatingopportunities for impulse buying.Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.If you did this, more people would save more.It's simply a question of changing the interfaceby which people make decisions,and the very nature of the decisions changes.Obviously, I don't want people to do this,because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as justconsumerism needlessly postponed.(Laughter)But if anybody did want to do that,that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:fundamental opportunities to change human behavior.Now, I've got an example here from Canada.There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canadacalled Hunter Somerville,who was working in improv in Toronto,and got a part-time job in advertising,and was given the job of advertising Shreddies.Now this is the most perfect case of creatingintangible, added value,without changing the product in the slightest.Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.(Laughter)In working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,he came up with this.Video: (Buzzer)Man: Shreddies is supposed to be square.(Laughter)Woman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out?(Laughter)Voiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal.Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.(Applause)Rory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect exampleof intangible value creation. All it requires isphotons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.I would say it's a work of genius.But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.Man: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product,which is something very exciting for them.So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.(Laughter)So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.(Laughter)Woman: Weren't they square?Woman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.Man: They -- Yeah, it's all in the appearance.But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,if you flip it over it looks like a nine.But a six is very different from a nine.Woman # 3: Or an "M" and a "W". Man: An "M" and a "W", exactly.Man #2: [unclear]You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like thatit's more interesting looking.Man: Just try both of them.Take a square one there, first.(Laughter)Man: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.Man: The first one?(Laughter)Rory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.There were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,who actually resented this intrusion.So, eventually, the manufacturers actuallyarrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.(Laughter)(Applause)(Laughter)If you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization calledthe American Institute of Wine Economics,which actually does extensive research into perception of things,and discovers that except for amongperhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,there is no correlation between quality and enjoymentin wine,except when you tell the people how expensive it is,in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.So drink your wine blind in the future.But this is both hysterically funny --but I think an important philosophical point,which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,and less time agonizing over what else we can do.Two quotations to more or less end with.One of them is, "Poetry is when you make new thingsfamiliar and familiar things new."Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is,to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but alsoto gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value onthose things which are already existing.There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.Because they help people share news.They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,and increase the kind of third-partyenjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.The second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session,which is, "We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,"which I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.And a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,love, sex and other things,and learn to place a material valueon what you've previously discountedfor being merely intangible, a thing not seen,you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.Thank you very much indeed.(Applause)



david_logan_on_tribal_leadership

What we're really here to talk about is the "how."Okay, so how exactly do we create thisworld-shattering, if you will, innovation?Now, I want to tell you a quick story.We'll go back a little more than a year.In fact, the date -- I'm curious to knowif any of you know what happened on this momentous date?It was February 3rd, 2008.Anyone remember what happened,February 3rd, 2008?Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.And the reason that this date was so momentousis that what my colleagues, John Kingand Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticedas we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties,is that it seemed to usthat across the United States,if you will, tribal councils had convened.And they had discussed things of great national importance.Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"and, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?"But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.And if you go back in time to February 3rd,it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.But when we talked to people,it appeared that a funnel effect had happenedin these tribes all across the United States.Now what is a tribe? A tribe is a group ofabout 20 -- so kind of more than a team --20 to about 150 people.And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done.But not just work. It's within these tribesthat societies get built,that important things happen.And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representativesfrom various tribal councils that met,also known as Super Bowl parties,we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.We said, "The tribes that we're inare saying it's going to be Obama."Now, the reason we knew thatwas because we spent the previous 10 yearsstudying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.All of you are members of tribes.In walking around at the break,many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,which is to find someonewho is a member of a tribe,and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,and make introductions.That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.So here is the bottom line.If you focus in on a group like this --this happens to be a USC game --and you zoom in with one of those super satellite camerasand do magnification factors so you could see individual people,you would in fact see not a single crowd,just like there is not a single crowd here,but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.And from a distance it appears that it's a single group.And so people form tribes.They always have. They always will.Just as fish swim and birds fly,people form tribes. It's just what we do.But here's the rub.Not all tribes are the same,and what makes the difference is the culture.Now here is the net out of this.You're all a member of tribes.If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're inand nudge them forward,along these tribal stagesto what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.But we're going to start with what we call Stage One.Now, this is the lowest of the stages.You don't want this. Okay?This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.But it's one that I think we need to learn from.Stage One produces peoplewho do horrible things.This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.Stage One is a group where peoplesystematically sever relationships from functional tribes,and then pool togetherwith people who think like they do.Stage One is literally the culture of gangsand it is the culture of prisons.Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.And I want to make the pointthat as members of society, we need to.It's not enough to simply write people off.But let's move on to Stage Two.Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks."So, this other book that Steve mentioned,that just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance,"my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,argue that as people see the world, so they behave.Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,then their behavior will follow automatically from that.It will be despairing hostility.They'll do whatever it takes to survive,even if that means undermining other people.Now, my birthday is coming up shortly,and my driver's license expires.And the reason that that's relevant is that very soonI will be walking into what we calla Stage Two tribe,which looks like this.(Laughter)Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehiclesacross the land, you find a Stage Two culture?No. But in the one near me,where I have to go in just a few days,what I will say when I'm standing in line is,"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"(Laughter)Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?Actually, no, I'm not.But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.So in a Stage Two culture --and we find these in all sorts of different places --you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.You find them in all places in society.I've come across them at the organizationsthat everybody raves about as being best in class.But here is the point. If you believe and you sayto people in your tribe, in effect,"My life sucks.I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USCmy life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does."If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.What kind of innovation would get done?The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?In fact it would be basically nil.Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the onethat hits closest to home for many of us.Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.And we park. And we stay.Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."(Laughter)I'm great and you're not.Now imagine having a whole room of peoplesaying, in effect, "I'm great and you're not."Or, "I'm going to find some way to compete with youand come out on top as a result of that."A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.And one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my articlein the New England Journal of Medicine?"And the other said, "No. That's great. Congratulations!"The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,"Well while you were, you know, doing your research," --notice the condescending tone --"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeriesthan anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."And the third one got the same wry smile and said,"Well, while you were off doing your research,and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,that eventually we'll train monkeys to do,or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,I was off running the future of the residency program,which is really the future of medicine."And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.Now, we find these in placeswhere really smart, successful people show up.Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.(Laughter)Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.It is moving from Stage Threeto Stage Four.Let's take a look at a quick video snippet.This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.And my question on the other side is just going to be,"What do you think they value?"It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.This is their lobby.Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.Notice people are applauding for us.They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they didthey probably wouldn't applaud.But you'll notice the level of excitement.Notice, again, how they decorate their office.Now, what's important to people at Zappos,these may not be the things that are important to you.But they value things like fun. And they value creativity.One of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.So when individuals come togetherand find something that unites themthat's greater than their individual competence,then something very important happens.The group gels. And it changesfrom a group of highly motivatedbut fairly individually-centric peopleinto something larger,into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.There is, in fact, another stage.Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great,"this may seem a little incongruous.This is a scene or snippetfrom the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africafor which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.Now think about that. South Africa,terrible atrocities had happened in the society.And people came togetherfocused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.There was no road map. No one had ever doneanything like this before.And in this atmosphere, where the only guidancewas people's values and their noble cause,what this group accomplished was historic.And people, at the time, feared that South Africawould end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,descending into one skirmish after anotherin a civil war that seems to have no end.In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.Largely because people like Desmond Tutuset up a Stage Five processto involve the thousands and perhaps millionsof tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.So, people hear this and they conclude the following,as did we in doing the study.Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.That's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way?I don't want to talk like they doat the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.I really don't want to just say "I'm great,"because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.Saying, "We're great" -- that sounds pretty good.But I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great."Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findingsthat come out of all this.The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independenceand actually read it,the phrase that sticks in many of our mindsis things about inalienable rights.I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,oriented only by our values,no other guidance.In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two."My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,also known as King George.We're great! Who is not great? England!"Sorry. (Laughter)Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi?What about Martin Luther King?I mean, surely these were just people who preached, "Life is great," right?Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another.In fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.He didn't say "We have a dream." He said, "I have a dream."Why did he do that? Because most peopleare not at Stage Five.Two percent are at Stage One.About 25 percent are at Stage Two,saying, in effect, "My life sucks."48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes,say, "I'm great and you're not."And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.Only about 22 percent of tribesare at Stage Four,oriented by our values, saying "We're great.And our values are beginning to unite us."Only two percent, only two percent of tribesget to Stage Five.And those are the ones that change the world.So the first little finding from thisis that leaders need to be able to talk all the levelsso that you can touch every person in society.But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.So we have to have the ability to talkall the levels, to go to where they are.And then leaders nudge peoplewithin their tribes to the next level.I'd like to show you some examples of this.One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,former Mayor of San Francisco. Before thathe was Chief of Police in San Francisco.And he grew up essentially in Stage One.And you know what changed his life? It was walking intoone of these, a Boys and Girls Club.Now here is what happened to this personwho eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.He went from being alive and passionateat Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks,despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" --to walking into a Boys and Girls Club,folding his arms, sitting down in a chair,and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.I don't know anybody.I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were,then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything."In fact, that's progress.We move people from Stage One to Stage Twoby getting them in a new tribeand then, over time, getting them connected.So, what about movingfrom Stage Three to Stage Four?I want to argue that we're doing that right here.TED represents a set of values,and as we unite around these values,something really interesting begins to emerge.If you want this experience to live onas something historic,then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do somethingbeyond what people normally doand call networking.Which is not just to meet new peopleand extend your reach, extend your influence,but instead, find someone you don't know,and find someone else you don't know,and introduce them.That's called a triadic relationship.See, people who build world-changing tribes do that.They extend the reach of their tribesby connecting them, not just to myself,so that my following is greater,but I connect people who don't know each otherto something greater than themselves.And ultimately that adds to their values.But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,which is great, to Stage Five?The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out ofa place called the Gallup Organization.You know they do polls, right?So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?Pretty much everybody else who does polls.If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.So, they were bored.They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked."How could we,instead of just polling what Asia thinksor what the United States thinks,or who thinks what about Obamaversus McCain or something like that,what does the entire world think?"And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.They had people involved who were Nobel laureatesin economics, who reported being bored.And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paperand were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the populationof Sub-Saharan Africa?How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,and speak languages we don't speak,and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in orderto achieve on this great mission,we have to be able to do it.Incidentally, they did pull it off.And they released the first-ever world poll.So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.First of all: we all form tribes, all of us.You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reachof the tribes that you have.But the question on the table is this:What kind of an impact are the tribesthat you are in making?You're hearing one presentation after another,often representing a group of people, a tribe,about how they have changed the world.If you do what we've talked about, you listenfor how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.You remember to talk all five culture stages.Because we've got people in all five, around us.And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:Will your tribes change the world?Thank you very much.(Applause)



tim_brown_urges_designers_to_think_big

I'd like to talk a little bit this morningabout what happens if we move from designto design thinking.Now this rather old photo up thereis actually the first project I was ever hired to do,something like 25 years ago.It's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one,and my task was tomake this thing a little bit more modern,a little bit easier to use.I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job.Unfortunately, not very long afterwardsthe company went out of business.This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine.I put an attractive shell around some new technology.Again, 18 months later,the product was obsolete.And now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete.Now, I'm a fairly slow learner,but eventually it occurred to me thatmaybe what passed for designwasn't all that important --making things more attractive,making them a bit easier to use,making them more marketable.By focusing on a design,maybe just a single product,I was being incrementaland not having much of an impact.But I think this small view of designis a relatively recent phenomenon,and in fact really emergedin the latter half of the 20th centuryas design became a tool of consumerism.So when we talk about design today,and particularly when we read about it in the popular press,we're often talking about products like these.Amusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.Important? Not so very.But this wasn't always the way.And I'd like to suggest that if we takea different view of design,and focus less on the objectand more on design thinking as an approach,that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact.Now this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel,designed many great things in his career in the 19th century,including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristoland the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.Both great designs and actually very innovative too.His greatest creationruns actually right through here in Oxford.It's called the Great Western Railway.And as a kid I grew up very close to here,and one of my favorite things to dowas to cycle along by the side of the railwaywaiting for the great big express trains to roar past.You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting,"Rain, Steam and Speed".Now, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengerswas the experience of floating across the countryside.Now, this was back in the 19th century.And to do that meant creating the flattest gradientsthat had ever yet been made,which meant building long viaducts across river valleys --this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead --and long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire.But he didn't stop there. He didn't stopwith just trying to design the best railway journey.He imagined an integrated transportation systemin which it would be possible for a passenger to embarkon a train in Londonand disembark from a ship in New York.One journey from London to New York.This is the S.S. Great Western that he builtto take care of the second half of that journey.Now, Brunel was working 100 years beforethe emergence of the design profession,but I think he was using design thinkingto solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.Now, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin,the business school professor at the University of Toronto,calls integrative thinking.And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideasand opposing constraintsto create new solutions.In the case of design, that meansbalancing desirability, what humans need,with technical feasibility,and economic viability.With innovations like the Great Western,we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.So somehow, we went from this to this.Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world,to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glassesworking on small things.As our industrial society matured,so design became a professionand it focused on an ever smaller canvasuntil it came to stand for aesthetics,image and fashion.Now I'm not trying to throw stones here.I'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood,and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.There we go.But I do think that perhaps designis getting big again.And that's happening throughthe application of design thinkingto new kinds of problems --to global warming, to education,healthcare, security, clean water, whatever.And as we see this reemergence of design thinkingand we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems,there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.And I'd like to talk about some of thosejust for the next few minutes.The first of those is that design ishuman-centered.It may integrate technology and economics,but it starts with what humans need, or might need.What makes life easier, more enjoyable?What makes technology useful and usable?But that is more than simply good ergonomics,putting the buttons in the right place.It's often about understanding culture and contextbefore we even know where to start to have ideas.So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India,they wanted to understand what the aspirationsand motivations were of these school childrento understand how they might play a rolein screening their parents.Conversion Sound has developed a high quality,ultra-low-cost digital hearing aidfor the developing world.Now, in the West we rely on highly trained techniciansto fit these hearing aids.In places like India, those technicians simply don't exist.So it took a team working in Indiawith patients and community health workersto understand how a PDAand an application on a PDAmight replace those techniciansin a fitting and diagnostic service.Instead of starting with technology,the team started with people and culture.So if human need is the place to start,then design thinking rapidly moves on tolearning by making.Instead of thinking about what to build,building in order to think.Now, prototypes speed up the process of innovation,because it is only when we put our ideas out into the worldthat we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses.And the faster we do that,the faster our ideas evolve.Now, much has been said and written aboutthe Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India.They do an incredible job of serving very poor patientsby taking the revenues from those who can afford to payto cross-subsidize those who cannot.Now, they are very efficient,but they are also very innovative.When I visited them a few years ago,what really impressed me was their willingnessto prototype their ideas very early.This is the manufacturing facilityfor one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.They make their own intraocular lenses.These are the lenses that replace thosethat are damaged by cataracts.And I think it's partly their prototyping mentalitythat really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough.Because they brought the cost downfrom $200 a pair,down to just $4 a pair.Partly they did this by instead of buildinga fancy new factory,they used the basement of one of their hospitals.And instead of installing the large-scale machinesused by western producers,they used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing worldand have recently moved into a custom factory.So if human need is the place to start,and prototyping, a vehicle for progress,then there are also some questions to ask about the destination.Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption,design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation --the shift from a passive relationshipbetween consumer and producerto the active engagement of everyonein experiences that are meaningful,productive and profitable.So I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about,this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things,and take that a little bit further and say thatI think the design of participatory systems,in which many more forms of valuebeyond simply cashare both created and measured,is going to be the major theme, not only for design,but also for our economy as we go forward.So William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942,created what became Britain's welfare statein which he hoped that every citizenwould be an active participantin their own social well-being.By the time he wrote his third report,he confessed that he had failedand instead had created a society of welfare consumers.Hilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater,and Hugo Manassei of Participlehave taken this idea of participation,and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0,they are suggesting a frameworkfor reinventing the welfare state.So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle,they worked with residents in Southwark, South Londonand a small team of designersto develop a new membership organizationto help the elderly with household tasks.Designs were refined and developedwith 150 older people and their familiesbefore the service was launched earlier this year.We can take this idea of participationperhaps to its logical conclusionand say that design may have its greatest impactwhen it's taken out of the hands of designersand put into the hands of everyone.Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare systemKaiser Permanentestudy the topic of improving the patient experience,and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledgeand change shift.Through a program of observational research,brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping,they've developed a completely new way to change shift.They went from retreating to the nurse's stationto discuss the various states and needs of patients,to developing a system that happened on the wardin front of patients, using a simple software tool.By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patientsdown from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average.They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness.When you multiply that by all the nursesin all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system,it resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.And this is just one of thousandsof opportunities in healthcare alone.So these are just some of the kind of basic ideasaround design thinkingand some of the new kinds of projectsthat they're being applied to.But I'd like to go back to Brunel here,and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now,and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool.And that connection is change.In times of change we neednew alternatives, new ideas.Now, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution,when all of life and our economywas being reinvented.Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course,and indeed they are part of the problem today.But, again, we are in the midst of massive change.And that change is forcing us to questionquite fundamental aspects of our society --how we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves,how we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.And in these times of change, we need these new choicesbecause our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.So why design thinking?Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems.Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approachwhere we make the best choice out of available alternatives,it encourages us to take a divergent approach,to explore new alternatives, new solutions,new ideas that have not existed before.But before we go through that process of divergence,there is actually quite an important first step.And that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer?What's the design brief?Now Brunel may have asked a question like this,"How do I take a train from London to New York?"But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?So these are some that we've been asked to think about recently.And one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund,in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.How might we improve access to safe drinking waterfor the world's poorest people,and at the same time stimulate innovationamongst local water providers?So instead of having a bunch of American designerscome up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate,we took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach.We teamed designers and investment experts up with11 water organizations across India.And through workshops they developedinnovative new products, services, and business models.We hosted a competitionand then funded five of those organizationsto develop their ideas.So they developed and iterated these ideas.And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with themto help design new social marketing campaigns,community outreach strategies, business models,new water vessels for storing waterand carts for delivering water.Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market.And the same process is just getting underwaywith NGOs in East Africa.So for me, this project showskind of how far we can go fromsome of those sort of small thingsthat I was working onat the beginning of my career.That by focusing on the needs of humansand by using prototypesto move ideas along quickly,by getting the process out of the hands of designers,and by getting the active participation of the community,we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions.And just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,we can have a bigger impact.So that's one thing that we've been working on.I'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interestedto know what this community thinks we could work on.What kinds of questions do we thinkdesign thinking could be used to tackle?And if you've got any ideasthen feel free, you can post them to Twitter.There is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ.And the list looked something like this a little while ago.And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested inby using the same hash code.So I'd like to believe that design thinkingactually can make a difference,that it can help create new ideasand new innovations,beyond the latest High Street products.To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design,more like Brunel, less a domain of a professional priesthood.And the first step is to start asking the right questions.Thank you very much.(Applause)

Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.Arguably the financial markets have failed usand the aid system is failing us,and yet I stand firmly with the optimistswho believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.Because of the resources, the skills,and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world,with the mindset to create change.And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen,who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower,but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.And by definition, every one of you who is in this roommust consider yourself a global soul,a global citizen.You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worstthat human beings can do for one another and to one another.And no matter what country you live or work in,you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,even in their most ordinariness.Today there is a raging debateas to how best we lift people out of poverty,how best we release their energies.On the one hand, we have people that saythe aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.And on the other we have people who saythe problem is that we need more aid.And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.We call it patient capital.The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spentin Africa since 1970and say, and what do we have but environmental degradationand incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?They use Mobutu as metaphor.And their policy prescription is tomake government more accountable,focus on the capital markets,invest, don't give anything away.On the other side, as I said, there are those who saythe problem is that we need more money.That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail outand we'll hand a lot of aid,but when it comes to our poor brethren,we want little to do with it.They point to the successes of aid:the eradication of smallpox,and the distribution of tens of millionsof malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.Both sides are right.And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.Even more problematic, they're not listening topoor people themselves.After 25 years of working on issues ofpoverty and innovation,it's true that there are probably no more market-orientedindividuals on the planetthan low-income people.They must navigate markets daily,making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,to move their way through society,and yet if a single catastrophic health problemimpacts their family,they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.And so we need both the marketand we need aid.Patient capital works between,and tries to take the best of both.It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communitiesand are building solutionsto healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,but as individual customers, consumers, clients,people who want to make decisions in their own lives.Patient capital requires that we haveincredible tolerance for risk,a long time horizon in terms of allowing thoseentrepreneurs time to experiment,to use the market as the best listening device that we have,and the expectation of below-market returns,but outsized social impact.It recognizes that the market has its limitation,and so patient capital also workswith smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economyto include all people.Now, entrepreneurs need patient capitalfor three reasons.First, they tend to work in marketswhere people make one, two, three dollars a dayand they are making all of their decisions within that income level.Second, the geographies in which they workhave terrible infrastructure --no roads to speak of, sporadic electricityand high levels of corruption.Third, they are often creating markets.Even if you're bringing clean waterfor the first time into rural villages, it is something new.And so many low-income peoplehave seen so many failed promises brokenand seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to themthat building trust takes a lot of time,takes a lot of patience.It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.Not only to build the systems,the business models that allow usto reach low income people in a sustainable way,but to connect those businessto other markets, to governments, to corporations --real partnerships if we want to get to scale.I want to share one storyabout an innovation called drip irrigation.In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneurnamed Amitabha Sadangi from India,who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.And he was expressing his frustrationthat the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,despite the fact that 200 million farmersalone in India make under a dollar a day.They were creating subsidieseither for large farms,or they were giving inputs to the farmersthat they thought they should use, rather thanthat the farmers wanted to use.At the same time Amitabha wasobsessed with this drip irrigation technologythat had been invented in Israel.It was a way of bringing small amounts of waterdirectly to the stalk of the plant.And it could transformswaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,because these systems were both too expensive,and they were constructed for fields that were too large.The average small village farmerworks on two acres or less.And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovationand he would redesign it from the perspectiveof the poor farmers themselves,because he spent so many years listening to what they needednot what he thought that they should have.And he used three fundamental principles.The first one was miniaturization.The drip irrigation systemhad to be small enough that a farmer only hadto risk a quarter acre,even if he had two,because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.Second, it had to be extremely affordable.In other words, that risk on the quarter acreneeded to be repaid in a single harvest,or else they wouldn't take the risk.And third, it had to be what Amitabha callsinfinitely expandable.What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,the farmers could buy a secondand a third and a fourth.As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,has sold over 300,000 farmers these systemsand has seen their yields and incomesdouble or triple on average,but this didn't happen overnight.In fact, when you go back to the beginning,there were no private investorswho would be willing to take a risk on building a new technologyfor a market class that made under a dollar a day,that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planetand that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.And so we needed grants. And he used significant grantsto research, to experiment, to fail,to innovate and try again.And when he had a prototypeand had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,that's when patient capital could come in.And we helped him build a company, for profit,that would build on IDE's knowledge,and start looking at sales and exports,and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could exportthis drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.And while, again, you needed patienceto move a technology for the poorin India into Pakistan,just to get the permits,over time we were able to start a companywith Dr. Sono, who runs a largecommunity development organization in the Thar Desert,which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.And though that company has just started,our assumption is that there toowe'll see the impact on millions.But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.We're starting to see these happening all around the world.In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturinghas worked in partnership with us,with UNICEF, with the Global Fund,to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednetsfor Africans around the world.Lifespring Hospitalis a joint venture between Acumen and the government of Indiato bring quality, affordable maternal health careto low-income women,and it's been so successful that it's currently buildinga new hospital every 35 days.And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going toreinvent a completely broken industry,building an ambulance service in Bombaythat would use the technology of Google Earth,a sliding scale pricing systemso that all people could have access,and a severe and public decisionnot to engage in any form of corruption.So that in the terrorist attacks of Novemberthey were the first responder,and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companiesin India.This idea of scale is critical.Because we're starting to see these enterprisesreach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussedhave reached at least a quarter million people.But that's obviously not enough.And it's where the idea of partnershipbecomes so important.Whether it's by finding those innovationsthat can access the capital markets,government itself, or partner with major corporations,there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.President Obama understands that.He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fundto focus on what works in this country,and look at how we can scale it.And I would submit that it's time to considera global innovation fundthat would find these entrepreneurs around the worldwho really have innovations, not only for their country,but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.And then measure the returns,both from a financial perspectiveand from a social impact perspective.When we think about new approaches to aid,it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.We've had a rocky relationship with that countryand, in all fairness,the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.But again I would say that this is our momentfor extraordinary things to happen.And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,we could use this time to investnot directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,nor in international experts,but in the many existing entrepreneursand civil society leaderswho already are building wonderful innovationsthat are reaching people all across the country.People like Rashani Zafar,who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a waycalled incremental housing,where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellersinto safe, affordable community housing.Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundationthat are building schools across the country.It's not hyperboleto say that these civil society institutionsand these social entrepreneursare building real alternatives to the Taliban.I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,and those of you who've also worked therecan attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.President Kennedy said thatthose who make peaceful revolution impossiblemake violent revolution inevitable.I would say that the converse is true.That these social leaderswho really are looking at innovationand extending opportunityto the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,provide real pathways to hope.And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,while we need to strengthen the judiciary,build greater stability,we also need to think about lifting those leaderswho can be role models for the rest of the world.On one of my last visits to Pakistan,I asked Dr. Sono if he would take meto see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.It was about 115 degrees.And we drove for eight hoursalong this moonscape-like landscapewith very little color, lots of heat,very little discussion, because we were exhausted.And finally, at the end of the journey,I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.That there in the desertwas a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.Because one of the poorest farmers on Earthhad gotten access to a technologythat had allowed him to change his own life.His name was Raja,and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyesand warm expressive handsthat reminded me of my father.And he said it was the first dry seasonin his entire life that he hadn't takenhis 12 children and 50 grandchildrenon a two day journey across the desertto work as day laborers at a commercial farmfor about 50 cents a day.Because he was building these crops.And with the money he earned he could stay this year.And for the first time ever in three generations,his children would go to school.We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.And he said, "Of course I will.Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore."When we think about solutions to poverty,we cannot deny individualstheir fundamental dignity.Because at the end of the day,dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectorswho are building innovations that recognizethat what people want is freedomand choice and opportunity.Because that is where dignity really starts.Martin Luther King said thatlove without power is anemic and sentimental,and that power without loveis reckless and abusive.Our generation has seen both approaches tried,and often fail.But I think our generation also might be the firstto have the courage to embrace both love and power.For that is what we'll need, as we move forwardto dream and imagine what it will really taketo build a global economy that includes all of us,and to finally extend that fundamental propositionthat all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.The time for us to begin innovatingand looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.I can only talk from my own experience,but in eight years of running Acumen fund,I've seen the power of patient capital.Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking,but to truly build systems that have createdmore than 25,000 jobsand delivered tens of millions of services and productsto some of the poorest people on the planet.I know it works.But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,in whatever job you do,to start thinking about how we mightbuild solutions that startfrom the perspective of those we're trying to help.Rather than what we think that they might need.It will take embracing the world with both arms.And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,with a sense of integrity and perseverance.And yet these are the very qualitiesfor which men and women have been honoredthroughout the generations.And there is so much good that we can do.Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.Thank you.(Applause)

but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.(Laughter)In the late 1980s,in a moment of youthful indiscretion,I went to law school.(Laughter)In America, law is a professional degree:When I got to law school,I didn't do very well.To put it mildly, I didn't do very well.that made the top 90% possible.(Laughter)Thank you.I never practiced law a day in my life;I pretty much wasn't allowed to.(Laughter)But today, against my better judgment,against the advice of my own wife,what's left of those legal skills.I don't want to tell you a story.I want to make a case.I want to make a hard-headed,evidence-based,dare I say lawyerly case,for rethinking how we run our businesses.So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,take a look at this.This is called the candle problem.Some of you might know it.It's created in 1945by a psychologist named Karl Duncker.He created this experimentI bring you into a room.And I say to you,so the wax doesn't drip onto the table."Now what would you do?Doesn't work.It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.And eventually, after five or ten minutes,most people figure out the solution,which you can see here.But it can also have this other function,as a platform for the candle.The candle problem.done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,who is now at Princeton University, US,This shows the power of incentives.He gathered his participants and said:To one group he said,"I'm going to time you to establish norms,To the second group he offered rewards.you get five dollars.you get 20 dollars."It's a nice motivator.Question:Answer:3.5 min longer.This makes no sense, right?(Laughter)Incentivize them.That's how business works.But that's not happening here.You've got an incentive designedand it does just the opposite.It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.What's interesting about this experimentis that it's not an aberration.for nearly 40 years.These contingent motivators --if you do this, then you get that --work in some circumstances.or, often, they do harm.and also one of the most ignored.I spent the last couple of yearsand intrinsic motivators.And I'm telling you, it's not even close.between what science knowsand what business does.around carrots and sticks.But for 21st century tasks,doesn't work,often doesn't work,and often does harm.Let me show you.Glucksberg did another similar experiment,like this up here.Same deal. You: we're timing for norms.You: we're incentivizing.What happened this time?Why?Because when the tacks are out of the box,it's pretty easy isn't it?(Laughter)where there is a simple set of rulesand a clear destination to go to.Rewards, by their very nature,narrow our focus, concentrate the mind;that's why they work in so many cases.So, for tasks like this,zoom straight ahead to it,they work really well.But for the real candle problem,you don't want to be looking like this.That reward actually narrows our focusand restricts our possibility.Let me tell you why this is so important.In western Europe,in many parts of Asia,in North America, in Australia,and more of this kind of work.computer programming --has become fairly easy to outsource,fairly easy to automate.Software can do it faster.Low-cost providers can do it cheaper.So what really mattersThink about your own work.Think about your own work.Are the problems that you face,do they have a clear set of rules,and a single solution?No. The rules are mystifying.The solution, if it exists at all,is surprising and not obvious.Everybody in this roomAnd for candle problems of any kind,in any field,those if-then rewards,don't work!It makes me crazy.And here's the thing.This is not a feeling.This is not a philosophy.(Laughter)This is a fact --a true fact.(Laughter)(Applause)Let me give you an example.Let me marshal the evidence here.games that involved creativity,and motor skills, and concentration.And the offered them, for performance,three levels of rewards:What happened?bonuses worked as they would be expected:Okay?a larger reward led to poorer performance.Then they said,Let's go to Madurai, India and test it."Standard of living is lower.is more meaningful there.What happens?People offered the medium level of rewardsthey did the worst of all.No, these are economists from MIT,Do you know who sponsored this research?That's the American experience.LSE, London School of Economics,like George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,and Mick Jagger.(Laughter)Last month,just last month,economists at LSE looked at 51 studiesHere's what they said:"We find that financial incentivesand what business does.of the economic collapse,their policies about talent and people,based on assumptions that are outdated,unexamined,if we really want high performanceto entice people with a sweeter carrot,or threaten them with a sharper stick.We need a whole new approach.The good news is that the scientistsrevolves around three elements:autonomy, mastery and purpose.Purpose: the yearning to do what we dofor our businesses.I want to talk today only about autonomy.Management did not emanate from nature.Somebody invented it.Management is great.if you want compliance.You don't see a lot of it,getting the issue of money off the table,and then giving people lots of autonomy.Some examples.It looks like less than half.(Laughter)And they do something incredibly cool.Work on anything you want."come up with an elegant hack.Being Australians, everybody has a beer.They call them FedEx Days.Why?It's pretty; not bad.(Laughter)That one day of intense autonomythat might never have existed.with 20% time --done, famously, at Google --working on anything they want.They have autonomy over their time,their task, their team, their technique.Radical amounts of autonomy.And at Google, as many of you know,are birthed during that 20% time:things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.created by two American consultants,In a ROWE people don't have schedules.They show up when they want.They just have to get their work done.What happens?Almost across the board,Autonomy, mastery and purpose,Some of you might look at this and say,"Hmm, that sounds nice, but it's Utopian."And I say, "Nope.I have proof."Different model, right?Do it for fun.Do it because you like to do it.Just 10 years ago,if you had gone to an economist, anywhere,If they went head to head, who would win?"anywhere on planet EarthThis is the Thrilla in Manila.Autonomy, mastery and purpose,versus carrot and sticks, and who wins?Let me wrap up.Here is what science knows.One: Those 20th century rewards,but that unseen intrinsic drive--the drive to do things for their own sake.The drive to do things cause they matter.And here's the best part.We already know this.into the 21st century,of carrots and sticks,we can strengthen our businesses,and maybe, maybe --we can change the world.I rest my case.(Applause)

Take a look at this picture.It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.These African students are doing their homeworkunder streetlights at the airport in the capital citybecause they don't have any electricity at home.Now, I haven't met these particular students,but I've met students like them.Let's just pick one -- for example, the one in the green shirt.Let's give him a name, too: Nelson.I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.So here is the puzzle.Why is it that Nelson has accessto a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone,but doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technologyfor generating electric light in the home?Now, in a word, the answer is "rules."Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's availablewhen people can bring new technologies inand make them available to someone like Nelson.What kinds of rules?The electric company in this nationoperates under a rule, which says that it has to sellelectricity at a very low, subsidized price --in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.So it has neither the resources, nor the incentives,to hook up many other users.The president wanted to change this rule.He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules,rules where businesses earn a small profit,so they have an incentive to sign up more customers.That's the kind of rules that the cellphone companythat Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.The president has seen how those rules worked well.So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,but ran into a firestorm of protestfrom businesses and consumerswho wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.So he was stuck with rules that prevented himfrom letting the win-win solution help his country.And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.The real challenge then, is to try to figure outhow we can change rules.Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?I want to argue that there is a general abstract insightthat we can make practical,which is that, if we can give more choices to people,and more choices to leaders --who, in many countries, are also people.(Laughter)But, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader,a choice like giving the president the choiceto raise prices on electricity,takes away a choice that people in the economy want.They want the choice to be able to continue consumingsubsidized electric power.So if you give just to one side or the other,you'll have tension or friction.But if we can find ways to give more choices to both,that will give us a set of rulesfor changing rules that get us out of traps.Now, Nelson also has access to the Internet.And he says that if you want to seethe damaging effects of rules,the ways that rules can keep people in the dark,look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.In particular check out Asia.If you zoom in here,you can see North Korea, in outline here,which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.Now, you won't be surprised to learnthat the rules in North Koreakeep people there in the dark.But it is important to recognizethat North Korea and South Koreastarted out with identical sets of rulesin both the sense of laws and regulations,but also in the deeper senses of understandings,norms, culture, values and beliefs.When they separated, they made choicesthat led to very divergent pathsfor their sets of rules.So we can change -- we as humans can change the rulesthat we use to interact with each other,for better, or for worse.Now let's look at another region, the Caribbean.Zoom in on Haiti,in outline here.Haiti is also dark,compared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic,which has about the same number of residents.Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico,which has half as many residentsas either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.What Haiti warns us is thatrules can be bad because governments are weak.It's not just that the rules are bad becausethe government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.So that if we want to create environments with good rules,we can't just tear down.We've got to find ways to build up, as well.Now, China dramatically demonstratesboth the potential and the challengesof working with rules.Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart,China was the world's high-technology leader.Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder.But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period,effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas --a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.And they soon adopted rules whichslowed down innovationand cut China off from the rest of the world.So as other countries in the world innovated,in the sense both of developingnewer technologies,but also developing newer rules,the Chinese were cut off from those advances.Income there stayed stagnant,as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.This next chart looks at more recent data.It plots income, average income in Chinaas a percentage of average income in the United States.In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.But then in the late '70s something changed.Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching upvery quickly with the United States.If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clueto the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.The brightest spot in China,which you can see on the edge of the outline here,is Hong Kong.Hong Kong was a small bit of Chinathat, for most of the 20th century,operated under a very different set of rulesthan the rest of mainland China --rules that were copiedfrom working market economies of the time,and administered by the British.In the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place wheremillions of people could go, from the mainland,to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.But, to get on a process of increasing income,increasing skillsled to very rapid growth there.Hong Kong was also the modelwhich leaders like Deng Xiaopingcould copy, when they decided to moveall of the mainland towards the market model.But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understoodthe importance of offering choices to his people.So instead of forcing everyone in Chinato shift immediately to the market model,they proceeded by creating some special zonesthat could do, in a sense, what Britain did:make the opportunity to go work with the market rulesavailable to the people who wanted to opt in there.So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:zones where Chinese could come and work,and cities grew up very rapidly there;also zones where foreign firms could come inand make things.One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.In that city there is a Taiwanese firmthat made the iPhone that many of you have,and they made it with labor from Chinesewho moved there to Shenzhen.So after the four special zones,there were 14 coastal citesthat were open in the same sense,and eventually demonstrated successesin these places that people could opt in to,that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus fora move toward the market model for the entire economy.Now the Chinese example shows us several points.One is: preserve choices for people.Two: operate on the right scale.If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that,but a village would be too smallto get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of peopleall working under good rules.On the other hand, the nation is too big.If you try to change the rules in the nation,you can't give some people a chanceto hold back, see how things turn out,and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.But cities give you this opportunityto create new places,with new rules that people can opt in to.And they're large enoughto get all of the benefits that we can havewhen millions of us work together under good rules.So the proposal is that weconceive of something called a charter city.We start with a charter that specifiesall the rules requiredto attract the people who we'll need to build the city.We'll need to attract the investorswho will build out the infrastructure --the power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.You'll need to attract firms,who will come hire the people who move there first.And you'll need to attract families,the residents who will come and live there permanently,raise their children, get an education for their children,and get their first job.With that charter, people will move there.The city can be built.And we can scale this model.We can go do it over and over again.To make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.Those are captured in the charter.We also need the choices for people.That's really built into the modelif we allow for the possibility of building citieson uninhabited land.You start from uninhabited territory.People can come live under the new charter,but no one is forced to live under it.The final thing we need are choices for leaders.And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaderswe need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:cases where nations work together,in effect, de facto,the way China and Britain worked togetherto build, first a little enclave of the market model,and then scale it throughout China.In a sense, Britain, inadvertently,through its actions in Hong Kong,did more to reduce world povertythan all the aid programs that we've undertakenin the last century.So if we allow for these kind of partnershipsto replicate this again,we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility,a delegation of control from one country to anotherto take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities.Now, when I say that,some of you are starting to think,"Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?"It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotionsthat come up when we start to think about these things,can get in the way, can make us pull back,can shut down our ability,and our interest in trying to explore new ideas.Why is this not like colonialism?The thing that was bad about colonialism,and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs,is that it involved elements ofcoercion and condescension.This model is all about choices,both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.And, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.So let's talk about how this could play out in practice.Let's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.It must have occurred to Castrothat he has the chance to do for Cubawhat Deng Xiaoping did for China,but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the souththat has a very special status.There is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay,where a treaty gives the United Statesadministrative responsibilityfor a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan.Castro goes to the prime minister of Canadaand says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.They want to get out.Why don't you, Canada, take over?Build -- run a special administrative zone.Allow a new city to be built up there.Allow many people to come in.Let us have a Hong Kong nearby.Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.Others will hold back. But this will bethe gateway that will connectthe modern economy and the modern worldto my country."Now, where else might this model be tried?Well, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.Many of them totally get the notion of a special zonethat people can opt into as a rule.It's a rule for changing rules.It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-inwithout coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.They also totally get the idea that in some instancesthey can make more credible promises to long-term investors --the kind of investors who will come build the port,build the roads, in a new city --they can make more credible promisesif they do it along with a partner nation.Perhaps even in some arrangementthat's a little bit like an escrow account,where you put land in the escrow accountand the partner nation takes responsibility for it.There is also lots of land in Africawhere new cities could be built.This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.There are immense stretches of land like this --land where hundreds of millions of people could live.Now, if we generalize this and think aboutnot just one or two charter cites, but dozens --cities that will help create places for themany hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of peoplewho will move to cities in the coming century --is there enough land for them?Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night,the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it lookslike most of the world is already built out.So let me show you why that's wrong.Take this representation of all of the land.Turn it into a square that stands forall the arable land on Earth.And let these dots represent the land that's already taken upby the cities that three billion people now live in.If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangleyou can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residentstake up only three percent of the arable land on earth.So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people,they would be dots like this.We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earthby building more cities that people can move to.And if these are cities governed by good rules,they can be cities where people are safe from crime,safe from disease and bad sanitation,where people have a chance to get a job.They can get basic utilities like electricity.Their kids can get an education.So what will it take to get startedbuilding the first charter cities,scaling this so we build many more?It would help to have a manual.(Laughter)What university professors could dois write some details that might go into this manual.You wouldn't want to let us run the cities,go out and design them.You wouldn't let academics out in the wild. (Laughter)But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like,suppose it isn't just Canadathat does the deal with Raul Castro.Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant,and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to beone of the partners in a four-way joint venture.How would we write the treaty to do that?There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.How would we finance this?Turns out Singapore and Hong Kongare cities that made huge gainson the value of the land that they owned when they got started.You could use the gains on the value of the landto pay for things like the police, the courts,but the school system and the health care system too,which make this a more attractive place to live,makes this a place where people have higher incomes --which, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zoneand build it, and set up the basic rules,go very much in the right direction.So there are many other details like this.How could we have buildings that arelow cost and affordable for people who workin a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,but make those buildings energy efficient,and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall downin an earthquake or a hurricane.Many technical details to be worked out,but those of us who are already starting to pursue these thingscan already tell that there is no roadblock,there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination,that will keep us from delivering ona truly global win-win solution.Let me conclude with this picture.The reason we can be so well off,even though there is so many people on earth,is because of the power of ideas.We can share ideas with other people,and when they discover them, they share with us.It's not like scarce objects,where sharing means we each get less.When we share ideas we all get more.When we think about ideas in that way,we usually think about technologies.But there is another class of ideas:the rules that govern how we interact with each other;rules like, let's have a tax systemthat supports a research universitythat gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free.Let's have a system where we have ownership of landthat is registered in a government office,that people can pledge as collateral.If we can keep innovating on our space of rules,and particularly innovate in the senseof coming up with rules for changing rules,so we don't get stuck with bad rules,then we can keep moving progress forwardand truly make the world a better place,so that people like Nelson and his friendsdon't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.(Applause)

Good morning everybody.I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.The first thing is water.Now I see you've all been enjoying the waterthat's been provided for you here at the conference,over the past couple of days.And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.But what if it wasn't?What if it was from a source like this?Then statistics would actually saythat half of you would now be sufferingwith diarrhea.I talked a lot in the past about statistics,and the provision of safe drinking water for all.But they just don't seem to get through.And I think I've worked out why.It's because, using current thinking,the scale of the problemjust seems too huge to contemplate solving.So we just switch off:us, governments and aid agencies.Well, today, I'd like to show youthat through thinking differently,the problem has been solved.By the way, since I've been speaking,another 13,000 people around the worldare suffering now with diarrhea.And four children have just died.I invented Lifesaver bottlebecause I got angry.I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004,when I was watching the devastating newsof the Asian tsunami as it rolled in,playing out on TV.The days and weeks that followed,people fleeing to the hills,being forced to drink contaminated wateror face death.That really stuck with me.Then, a few months later,Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America."Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."Day one: nothing.Day two: nothing.Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?People were shooting each other on the streetsfor TV sets and water.That's when I decided I had to do something.Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months,and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife. (Laughter)However, after a few failed prototypes,I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.Okay, now for the science bit.Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capableof filtering down to about 200 nanometers.The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.So a 200-nanometer bacteriais going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.The smallest virus, on the other hand,is about 25 nanometers.So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.So nothing is getting through.Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.Would you like to see that?I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.We're in the fine city of Oxford.So -- someone's done that up.Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've goneand got some water from the River Cherwell,and the River Thames,that flow through here. And this is the water.But I got to thinking, you know,if we were in the middle of a flood zonein Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.And this is from my pond.(Sniffs) (Coughs) Have a smell of that, mister cameraman.Okay. (Laughs) Right.We're just going to pour that in there.Audience: Ugh!Michael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runofffrom a sewage plant farm.So I'm just going to put that in there.(Laughter)Put that in there. There we go.(Laughter)And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.So we're just going to put that in there as well.(Laughter)Okay. (Laughter) Now.The Lifesaver bottle works really simply.You just scoop the water up.Today I'm going to use a jugjust to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water,and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?(Laughter)Okay. There we go.Replace the top.Give it a few pumps. Okay?That's all that's necessary.Now as soon as I pop the teat,sterile drinking water is going to come out.I've got to be quick. Okay, ready?There we go. Mind the electrics.That is safe, sterile drinking water.(Applause)Cheers.(Applause)There you go Chris.(Applause)What's it taste of?Chris Anderson: Delicious.Michael Pritchard: Okay.Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?(Laughter)Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.It'll last for 6,000 liters.And when it's expired, using failsafe technology,the system will shut off, protecting the user.Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.It's good for another 6,000 liters.So let's look at the applications.Traditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?We ship water.Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?Diseases spread. More resources are required.The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.But by thinking differently,and shipping these,people can stay put.They can make their own sterile drinking water,and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.Now, it doesn't require a natural disasterfor this to work.Using the old thinking, of national infrastructureand pipe work, is too expensive.When you run the numbers on a calculator,you run out of noughts.So here is the "thinking different" bit.Instead of shipping water,and using man-made processes to do it,let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.She picks the water up from there,desalinates it, for free, transports it over there,and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.And where do people live? Near water.All we've go to dois make it sterile. How do we do that?Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.Or we could use one of these.The same technology, in a jerry can.This will process 25,000 liters of water;that's good enough for a family of four,for three years.And how much does it cost?About half a cent a day to run.Thank you.(Applause)So, by thinking differently, and processing waterat the point of use,mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a dayto collect their water.They can get it from a source nearby.So with just eight billion dollars,we can hit the millennium goal's targetof halving the number of peoplewithout access to safe drinking water.To put that into context,The U.K. government spends about 12 billion poundsa year on foreign aid.But why stop there?With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.So the three-and-a-half billion peoplethat suffer every year as a result,and the two million kids that die every year,will live.Thank you.(Applause)

I want to share with yousome ideas about the secret power of time,in a very short time.Video: All right, start the clock please. 30 seconds studio.Keep it quiet please. Settle down.It's about time. End sequence. Take one.15 seconds studio.10, nine, eight, seven,six, five, four, three, two ...Philip Zimbardo: Let's tune into the conversationof the principals in Adam's temptation."Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did.""One bite, Adam. Don't abandon Eve.""I don't know, guys.I don't want to get in trouble.""Okay. One bite. What the hell?"(Laughter)Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting,yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective,present focus and future focus.Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment.Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage --thank you George Bush --the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.And most of them did so without using birth control.So much for promises.Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.They can have one marshmallow now. But if they waituntil the experimenter comes back, they can have two.Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.They cannot wait. The others, of course, wait.They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later.Walter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford,went back 14 years later,to try to discover what was different about those kids.There were enormous differences between kids who resistedand kids who yielded, in many ways.The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points.They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students.They were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today,the key for you,is, they were future-focused rather than present-focused.So what is time perspective? That's what I'm going to talk about today.Time perspective is the study of how individuals,all of us, divide the flow of your human experienceinto time zones or time categories.And you do it automatically and non-consciously.They vary between cultures, between nations,between individuals, between social classes,between education levels.And the problem is that they can become biased,because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others.What determines any decision you make?You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation,what other people are doing and what you're feeling.And those people, when they make their decisions in that format --we're going to call them "present-oriented,"because their focus is what is now.For others, the present is irrelevant.It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"So that their decisions are based on past memories.And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.For others it's not the past, it's not the present,it's only about the future.Their focus is always about anticipated consequences.Cost-benefit analysis.We're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be.So, time paradox, I want to argue,the paradox of time perspective,is something that influences every decision you make,you're totally unaware of.Namely, the extent to which you have one of thesebiased time perspectives.Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.You can be present-hedonistic,namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist --it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.You can be future-oriented, setting goals.Or you can be transcendental future:namely, life begins after death.Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidlydepending on the demands of the situation,that's what you've got to learn to do.So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?High on past-positive. Moderately high on future.And moderate on present-hedonism.And always low on past-negativeand present-fatalism.So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past --past-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self.What you get from the future is wingsto soar to new destinations, new challenges.What you get from the present hedonismis the energy, the energy to explore yourself,places, people, sensuality.Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.What do futures sacrifice for success?They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time.They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence.They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.And they live for work, achievement and control.I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.(Laughter)And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto,a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present.I'm here as a future-oriented personwho went over the top, who did all these sacrificesbecause teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.Told me don't eat that marshmallow,because if you wait you're going to get two of them,until I learned to balance out.I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive,so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive,and I'm happier than I have ever been.I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems:changing the drop-out rates of school kids,combating addictions, enhancing teen health,curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures --promoting sustainability and conservation,reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate,altering appeals to suicidal terrorists,and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes.So I want to end by saying:many of life's puzzles can be solvedby understanding your time perspective and that of others.And the idea is so simple, so obvious,but I think the consequences are really profound.Thank you so much.(Applause)

Why do so many people reach success and then fail?One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.So we do everything that leads up to success,but then we get there. We figure we've made it,we sit back in our comfort zone,and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.And it doesn't take long to go downhill.And I can tell you this happens,because it happened to me.Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.But then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it.I can just sit back and relax."Reaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work.But then I stopped because I figured, "Hey, I'm good enough.I don't need to improve any more."Reaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas.Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas.But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guyand I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.And the only thing that came was creative block.I couldn't come up with any ideas.Reaching success, I always focused on clients and projects,and ignored the money. Then all this money started pouring in.And I got distracted by it.And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent,when I should have been talking to my clients.And reaching success, I always did what I loved.But then I got into stuff that I didn't love,like management. I am the world's worst manager,but I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all,the president of the company.Well, soon a black cloud formed over my headand here I was, outwardly very successful,but inwardly very depressed.But I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.I bought a fast car.(Laughter)It didn't help.I was faster but just as depressed.So I went to my doctor. I said, "Doc,I can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed.It's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me.But money can't buy happiness."He said, "No. But it can buy Prozac."And he put me on anti-depressants.And yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work,because I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called.(Laughter)And clients didn't call.(Laughter)Because they could see I was no longer serving them,I was only serving myself.So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better.Well, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock.My partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go.It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.And that was great.Because with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage.So I went back to doing the projects I loved.I had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short,did all the things that took me back up to success.But it wasn't a quick trip.It took seven years.But in the end, business grew bigger than ever.And when I went back to following these eight principles,the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.And I woke up one day and I said,"I don't need Prozac anymore."And I threw it away and haven't needed it since.I learned that success isn't a one-way street.It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.It's a continuous journey.And if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome,"we just keep following these eight principles,because that is not only how we achieve success,it's how we sustain it.So here is to your continued success.Thank you very much.(Applause)

What's happening to the climate?It is unbelievably bad.This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic,which is likely to be gone at this pointin the next three or four or five years. Very, very, very scary.So we all look at what we can do.And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2,52 percent are tied to buildings.Only nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.So we ran off to a sushi bar.And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.And it was something called EcoRock.And we said we could redesign the 115-year-oldgypsum drywall process that generates20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.So it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent,which is exactly what we've done.We started R&amp;D in 2006.Decided to use recycled content from cementand steel manufacturing.There is the inside of our lab. We haven't shown this before.But our people had to do some 5,000different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.And they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.So then we went forward and built our production line in China.We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S., unfortunately.We did the line install over the summer.We started right there, with absolutely nothing.You're seeing for the first time, a brand new drywall production line,not made using gypsum at all.That's the finished production line there.We got our first panel out on December third.That is the slurry being poured onto paper, basically. That's the line running.The exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.These are people who worked this project for two to three years.And they are so excited. That's the first board off the line.Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very, very excited.But this has a huge, huge impact on the environment.We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that, had a great signing ceremony,leading to people hopefully using these products across the world.And we've got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing.We happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Yearfor "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science.Thank you. Thank you.So here is what we learned: 8,000 gallons of gasequivalent to build one house.You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times.We must change everything.Look around the room: chairs, wood,everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem.Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this, because anyone can.And these job losses, we can fix them with green-collar jobs.We've got four plants. We're building this stuff around the country.We're going as fast as we can.Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum,you know, CO2 generated. Right?So what will you do? I'll tell you what I did and why I did it. And I know my time's up.Those are my kids, Natalie and David.When they have their kids, 2050,they'd better look back at Grandpa and say,"Hey, you gave it a good shot. You did the best you couldwith the team that you had."So my hope is that when you leave TED,you will look at reducing your carbon footprintin however you can do it.And if you don't know how, please find me -- I will help you.Last but not least, Bill Gates, I know you invented Windows.Wait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented.Thank you so much.(Applause)

ray_anderson_on_the_business_logic_of_sustainability

Believe me or not, I come offering a solutionto a very important part of this larger problem,with the requisite focus on climate.And the solution I offeris to the biggest culpritin this massive mistreatment of the earthby humankind,and the resulting decline of the biosphere.That culprit is business and industry,which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 yearssince my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956.As an industrial engineer,cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur.After founding my company, Interface, from scratchin 1973, 36 years ago,to produce carpet tiles in Americafor the business and institution markets,and shepherding it through start-up and survivalto prosperity and global dominance in its field,I read Paul Hawken's book,"The Ecology of Commerce,"the summer of 1994.In his book, Paul charges business and industryas, one, the major culpritin causing the decline of the biosphere,and, two, the only institution that is large enough,and pervasive enough, and powerful enough,to really lead humankind out of this mess.And by the way he convicted meas a plunderer of the earth.And I then challenged the people of Interface, my company,to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability,which we defined as eventually operatingour petroleum-intensive company in such a wayas to take from the earthonly what can be renewed by the earth, naturally and rapidly --not another fresh drop of oil --and to do no harm to the biosphere.Take nothing: do no harm.I simply said, "If Hawken is rightand business and industry must lead,who will lead business and industry?Unless somebody leads, nobody will."It's axiomatic. Why not us?And thanks to the people of Interface,I have become a recovering plunderer.(Laughter)(Applause)I once told a Fortune Magazine writerthat someday people like me would go to jail.And that became the headline of a Fortune article.They went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO.From plunderer to recovering plunderer,to America's greenest CEO in five years --that, frankly, was a pretty sad commentaryon American CEOs in 1999.Asked later in the Canadian documentary, "The Corporation,"what I meant by the "go to jail" remark,I offered that theft is a crime.And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.But I realized, for that to be true --for theft of our children's future to be a crime --there must be a clear, demonstrable alternativeto the take-make-waste industrial systemthat so dominates our civilization,and is the major culprit, stealing our children's future,by digging up the earthand converting it to products that quickly become wastein a landfill or an incinerator --in short, digging up the earth and converting it to pollution.According to Paul and Anne Ehrlichand a well-known environmental impact equation,impact -- a bad thing --is the product of population, affluence and technology.That is, impact is generated by people,what they consume in their affluence,and how it is produced.And though the equation is largely subjective,you can perhaps quantify people, and perhaps quantify affluence,but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify.So the equation is conceptual.Still it works to help us understand the problem.So we set out at Interface, in 1994,to create an example:to transform the way we made carpet,a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy,and to transform our technologiesso they diminished environmental impact,rather than multiplied it.Paul and Anne Ehrlich's environmental impact equation:I is equal to P times A times T:population, affluence and technology.I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it readI equals P times A divided by T.Now, the mathematically-minded will see immediatelythat T in the numerator increases impact -- a bad thing --but T in the denominator decreases impact.So I ask, "What would move T, technology,from the numerator -- call it T1 --where it increases impact,to the denominator -- call it T2 --where it reduces impact?I thought about the characteristicsof first industrial revolution,T1, as we practiced it at Interface,and it had the following characteristics.Extractive: taking raw materials from the earth.Linear: take, make, waste.Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy.Wasteful: abusive and focused on labor productivity.More carpet per man-hour.Thinking it through, I realized that all those attributesmust be changed to move T to the denominator.In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable;linear by cyclical;fossil fuel energy by renewable energy, sunlight;wasteful by waste-free;and abusive by benign;and labor productivity by resource productivity.And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes,and get rid of T1 altogether,we could reduce our impact to zero,including our impact on the climate.And that became the Interface plan in 1995,and has been the plan ever since.We have measured our progress very rigorously.So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years.Net greenhouse gas emissionsdown 82 percent in absolute tonnage.(Applause)Over the same span of timesales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled.So an 82 percent absolute reductiontranslates into a 90 percent reductionin greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales.This is the magnitudeof the reduction the entire global technospheremust realize by 2050to avoid catastrophic climate disruption --so the scientists are telling us.Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production,due to efficiencies in renewables.The cheapest, most secure barrel of oil there isis the one not used through efficiencies.Water usage is down 75 percentin our worldwide carpet tile business.Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business,which we acquired in 1993right here in California, City of Industry,where water is so precious.Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total, and growing rapidly.Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total,going for 100 percent.We have diverted 148 million pounds --that's 74,000 tons --of used carpet from landfills,closing the loop on material flowsthrough reverse logisticsand post-consumer recycling technologiesthat did not exist when we started 14 years ago.Those new cyclical technologieshave contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpetsince 2004,meaning no net contribution to global climate disruptionin producing the carpet throughout the supply chain,from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation --independent third-party certified.We call it Cool Carpet.And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator,increasing sales and profits.Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home,under the brand Flor,misspelled F-L-O-R.You can point and click today at Flor.comand have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days.It is practical, and pretty too.(Laughter)(Applause)We reckon that we are a bit over halfwayto our goal: zero impact, zero footprint.We've set 2020 as our target year for zero,for reaching the top, the summit of Mount Sustainability.We call this Mission Zero.And this is perhaps the most important facet:we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business.A better business model,a better way to bigger profits.Here is the business case for sustainability.From real life experience, costs are down, not up,reflecting some 400 million dollarsof avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste --the first face of Mount Sustainability.This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface.And this dispels a myth too,this false choice between the environment and the economy.Our products are the best they've ever been,inspired by design for sustainability,an unexpected wellspring of innovation.Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose.You cannot beat it for attracting the best peopleand bringing them together.And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing.No amount of advertising, no clever marketing campaign,at any price, could have produced or createdthis much goodwill.Costs, products, people, marketplaces --what else is there?It is a better business model.And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits.There is a dip there, from 2001 to 2003:a dip when our sales, over a three-year period,were down 17 percent.But the marketplace was down 36 percent.We literally gained market share.We might not have survived that recessionbut for the advantages of sustainability.If every business were pursuing Interface plans,would that solve all our problems?I don't think so.I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation,I equals P times A divided by T2.That A is a capital A,suggesting that affluence is an end in itself.But what if we reframed Ehrlich further?And what if we made A a lowercase 'a,'suggesting that it is a means to an end,and that end is happiness --more happiness with less stuff.You know that would reframe civilization itself --(Applause) --and our whole system of economics,if not for our species, then perhaps for the one that succeeds us:the sustainable species, living on a finite earth,ethically, happily and ecologicallyin balance with natureand all her natural systems for a thousand generations,or 10,000 generations --that is to say, into the indefinite future.But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species?Well maybe so. But I don't think so.At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypicalsustainable, zero-footprint industrial companyfully into existence by 2020.We can see our way now,clear to the top of that mountain.And now the challenge is in execution.And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says,"If something exists, it must be possible."(Laughter)If we can actually do it, it must be possible.If we, a petro-intensive company can do it, anybody can.And if anybody can, it follows that everybody can.Hawken fulfilled business and industry,leading humankind away from the abyssbecause, with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere,a very dear person is at risk here --frankly, an unacceptable risk.Who is that person?Not you. Not I.But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here.And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb.On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996,I was talking to people, as I did at every opportunity back then,bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting.But about five days later back in Atlanta,I received an email from Glenn Thomas,one of my people in the California meeting.He was sending me an original poemthat he had composed after our Tuesday morning together.And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life.Because it told me, by God, one person got it.Here is what Glenn wrote. And here is that person, most at risk.Please meet "Tomorrow's Child.""Without a name, an unseen face, and knowing not your time or place,Tomorrow's child, though yet unborn,I met you first last Tuesday morn.A wise friend introduced us two.And through his sobering point of viewI saw a day that you would see, a day for you but not for me.Knowing you has changed my thinking.For I never had an inklingthat perhaps the things I do might someday,somehow threaten you.Tomorrow's child, my daughter, son,I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good,though always having known I should.Begin, I will.The way the cost of what I squander, what is lost,if ever I forget that youwill someday come and live here too."Well, every day of my life since,"Tomorrow's Child" has spoken to mewith one simple but profound message,which I presume to share with you.We are, each and every one,a part of the web of life.The continuum of humanity, sure, but in a larger sense, the web of life itself.And we have a choice to makeduring our brief, brief visitto this beautiful blue and green living planet:to hurt it or to help it.For you, it's your call.Thank you.(Applause)



nandan_nilekani_s_ideas_for_india_s_future
751900

Let me talk about Indiathrough the evolution of ideas.Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at itbecause in every society, especially an open democratic society,it's only when ideas take root that things change.Slowly ideas lead to ideology,lead to policies that lead to actions.In 1930 this country went through a Great Depression,which led to all the ideas of the state and social security,and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time.In the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution, which lead to deregulation.And today, after the global economic crisis,there was a whole new set of rulesabout how the state should intervene.So ideas change states.And I looked at India and said,really there are four kinds of ideaswhich really make an impact on India.The first, to my mind,is what I call as "the ideas that have arrived."These ideas have brought together somethingwhich has made India happen the way it is today.The second set of ideas I call "ideas in progress."Those are ideas which have been acceptedbut not implemented yet.The third set of ideas are what I call as"ideas that we argue about" --those are ideas where we have a fight,an ideological battle about how to do things.And the fourth thing, which I believe is most important, is"the ideas that we need to anticipate."Because when you are a developing countryin the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having,you can actually anticipatewhat that did and do things very differently.Now in India's case I believe there are six ideaswhich are responsible for where it has come today.The first is really the notion of people.In the '60s and '70swe thought of people as a burden.We thought of people as a liability.Today we talk of people as an asset.We talk of people as human capital.And I believe this change in the mindset,of looking at people as something of a burdento human capital,has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset.And this change in thinking of human capitalis linked to the factthat India is going through a demographic dividend.As healthcare improves,as infant mortality goes down,fertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that.India is going to havea lot of young people with a demographic dividendfor the next 30 years.What is unique about this demographic dividendis that India will be the only country in the worldto have this demographic dividend.In other words, it will be the only young country in an aging world.And this is very important. At the same timeif you peel away the demographic dividend in India,there are actually two demographic curves.One is in the south and in the west of India,which is already going to be fully expensed by 2015,because in that part of the country, the fertility rate isalmost equal to that of a West European country.Then there is the whole northern India,which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend.But a demographic dividend is only as goodas the investment in your human capital.Only if the people have education,they have good health, they have infrastructure,they have roads to go to work, they have lights to study at night --only in those cases can you really get the benefitof a demographic dividend.In other words, if you don't really invest in the human capital,the same demographic dividendcan be a demographic disaster.Therefore India is at a critical pointwhere either it can leverage its demographic dividendor it can lead to a demographic disaster.The second thing in India has been the change inthe role of entrepreneurs.When India got independence entrepreneurs were seenas a bad lot, as people who would exploit.But today, after 60 years, because of the rise of entrepreneurship,entrepreneurs have become role models,and they are contributing hugely to the society.This change has contributedto the vitality and the whole economy.The third big thing I believe that has changed Indiais our attitude towards the English language.English language was seen as a language of the imperialists.But today, with globalization,with outsourcing, English has become a language of aspiration.This has made it something that everybody wants to learn.And the fact that we have English is now becominga huge strategic asset.The next thing is technology.Forty years back, computers were seenas something which was forbidding, something which was intimidating,something that reduced jobs.Today we live in a countrywhich sells eight million mobile phones a month,of which 90 percent of those mobile phonesare prepaid phonesbecause people don't have credit history.Forty percent of those prepaid phonesare recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge.That is the scale at whichtechnology has liberated and made it accessible.And therefore technology has gonefrom being seen as something forbiddingand intimidating to something that is empowering.Twenty years back,when there was a report on bank computerization,they didn't name the report asa report on computers,they call them as "ledger posting machines."They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers.And when they wanted to have more advanced, more powerful computersthey called them "advanced ledger posting machines."So we have come a long way from those dayswhere the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment,and really has changed the way Indians think of technology.And then I think the other pointis that Indians today are far morecomfortable with globalization.Again, after having lived for more than 200 yearsunder the East India Company and under imperial rule,Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalizationbelieving it was a form of imperialism.But today, as Indian companies go abroad,as Indians come and work all over the world,Indians have gained a lot more confidenceand have realized that globalization is something they can participate in.And the fact that the demographics are in our favor,because we are the only young country in an aging world,makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians.And finally, India has hadthe deepening of its democracy.When democracy came to India 60 years backit was an elite concept.It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracybecause they wanted to bring in the idea ofuniversal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth.But today democracy has become a bottom-up processwhere everybody has realizedthe benefits of having a voice,the benefits of being in an open society.And therefore democracy has become embedded.I believe these six factors --the rise of the notion of population as human capital,the rise of Indian entrepreneurs,the rise of English as a language of aspiration,technology as something empowering,globalization as a positive factor,and the deepening of democracy -- has contributedto why India is today growingat rates it has never seen before.But having said that,then we come to what I call as ideas in progress.Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society,but you are not able to implement those things.And really there are four things here.One is the question of education.For some reason, whatever reason -- lack of money,lack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture --primary education was never given the focus it required.But now I believe it's reached a pointwhere it has become very important.Unfortunately the government schools don't function,so children are going to private schools today.Even in the slums of Indiamore than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools.So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work.But having said that, there is an enormous desireamong everybody, including the poor, to educate their children.So I believe primary education is an ideawhich is arrived but not yet implemented.Similarly, infrastructure --for a long time, infrastructure was not a priority.Those of you who have been to India have seen that.It's certainly not like China.But today I believe finally infrastructure is somethingwhich is agreed upon and which people want to implement.It is reflected in the political statements.20 years back the political slogan was, "Roti, kapada, makaan,"which meant, "Food, clothing and shelter."And today's political slogan is, "Bijli, sadak, pani,"which means "Electricity, water and roads."And that is a change in the mindsetwhere infrastructure is now accepted.So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived,but simply not implemented.The third thing is again cities.It's because Gandhi believed in villagesand because the British ruled from the cities,therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city.For a long time we have neglected our cities.And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see.But today, finally, after economic reforms,and economic growth,I think the notion that cities are enginesof economic growth,cities are engines of creativity,cities are engines of innovation,have finally been accepted.And I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities.Again, an idea which is arrived, but not yet implemented.The final thing is the notion of India as a single market --because when you didn't think of India as a market,you didn't really bother about a single market, because it didn't really matter.And therefore you had a situationwhere every state had its own market for products.Every province had its own market for agriculture.Increasingly now the policies oftaxation and infrastructure and all that,are moving towards creating India as a single market.So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening,which is as important as external globalization.These four factors I believe --the ones of primary education,infrastructure, urbanization, and single market --in my view are ideas in Indiawhich have been accepted, but not implemented.Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict.The ideas that we argue about.These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.What are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues.Because of the historical Indian background, in the caste system,and because of the fact that there have been many peoplewho have been left out in the cold,a lot of the politics is about how to make surethat we'll address that.And it leads to reservations and other techniques.It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people,and all the left and right arguments that we have.A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideologyof caste and other things.This policy is causing gridlock.This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved.The second one is the labor policies that we have,which make it so difficult forentrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies,that 93 percent of Indian laboris in the unorganized sector.They have no benefits: they don't have social security;they don't have pension; they don't have healthcare; none of those things.This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these peopleinto the formal workforce,you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws,which are not as onerous as they are today.At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector,and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for.The third thing is our higher education.Indian higher education is completely regulated.It's very difficult to start a private university.It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India.As a result of that our higher educationis simply not keeping pace with India's demands.That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address.But most important I believeare the ideas we need to anticipate.Here India can look at what is happening in the westand elsewhere, and look at what needs to be done.The first thing is, we're very fortunatethat technology is at a pointwhere it is much more advancedthan when other countries had the development.So we can use technology for governance.We can use technology for direct benefits.We can use technology for transparency, and many other things.The second thing is, the health issue.India has equally horriblehealth problems of the higher state of cardiac issue,the higher state of diabetes, the higher state of obesity.So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseaseswith a set of rich country diseases.Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health.We really need to put in place a strategyso that we don't go to the other extreme of health.Similarly today in the Westyou're seeing the problem of entitlement --the cost of social security, the cost of Medicare, the cost of Medicaid.Therefore when you are a young country,again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension systemso that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old.And then again, India does not have the luxuryof making its environment dirty,because it has to marry environment and development.Just to give an idea, the world has to stabilizeat something like 20 gigatons per year.On a population of nine billionour average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year.India is already at two tons per year.But if India grows at something like eight percent,income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050.So we're saying: income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon.Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment,the way we look at energy,the way we create whole new paradigms of development.Now why does this matter to you?Why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you?Number one, this matters becausethis represents more than a billion people.A billion people, 1/6th of the world population.It matters because this is a democracy.And it is important to provethat growth and democracy are not incompatible,that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society,and you can have growth.It's important because if you solve these problems,you can solve the problems of poverty in the world.It's important becauseyou need it to solve the world's environment problems.If we really want to come to a point,we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission,we want to really lower the use of energy --it has to be solved in countries like India.You know if you look at the developmentin the West over 200 years,the average growth may have been about two percent.Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent.And that makes a huge difference.When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percentand the population was growing at two percent,its per capita income was doubling every 45 years.When the economic growth goes to eight percentand population growth drops to 1.5 percent,then per capita income is doubling every nine years.In other words, you're certainly fast-forwarding this whole processof a billion people going to prosperity.And you must have a clear strategywhich is important for India and important for the world.That is why I think all of youshould be equally concerned with it as I am.Thank you very much.(Applause)

I'm not at all a cook.So don't fear, this is not going to be a cooking demonstration.But I do want to talk to you about somethingthat I think is dear to all of us.And that is bread -- something which is as simpleas our basic, most fundamental human staple.And I think few of us spend the daywithout eating bread in some form.Unless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets,bread is standard.Bread is not only standard in the Western diet.As I will show to you, it is actuallythe mainstay of modern life.So I'm going to bake bread for you.In the meantime I'm also talking to you,so my life is going to be complicated. Bear with me.First of all, a little bit of audience participation.I have two loaves of bread here.One is a supermarket standard:white bread, pre-packaged,which I'm told is called a Wonderbread.(Laughter)I didn't know this word until I arrived.And this is more or less,a whole-meal, handmade,small-bakery loaf of bread.Here we go. I want to see a show of hands.Who prefers the whole-meal bread?Okay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all?(Laughter)I have two tentative male hands.(Laughter)Okay, now the question is really,why is this so?And I think it is becausewe feel that this kind of breadreally is about authenticity.It's about a traditional way of living.A way that is perhaps more real, more honest.This is an image from Tuscany, where we feelagriculture is still about beauty.And life is really, too.And this is about good taste, good traditions.Why do we have this image?Why do we feel that this is more true than this?Well I think it has a lot to do with our history.In the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved,most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalistsor they were closely related to food production.And we have this mythical imageof how life was in rural areas in the past.Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image.It was a mythical past.Of course, the reality is quite different.These poor farmersworking the land by hand or with their animals,had yield levels that are comparableto the poorest farmers today in West Africa.But we have, somehow,in the course of the last few centuries, or even decades,started to cultivate an image ofa mythical, rural agricultural past.It was only 200 years agothat we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution.And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here,it's very important to understandwhat that revolution did to us.It brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.And it actually drove up our yields.And even sort of horrible things, like picking beans by hand,can now be done automatically.All that is a real, great improvement, as we shall see.Of course we also, particularly in the last decade,managed to envelop the worldin a dense chain of supermarkets,in a chain of global trade.And it means that you now eat products,which can come from all around the world.That is the reality of our modern life.Now you may prefer this loaf of bread.Excuse my hands but this is how it is.But actually the real relevant bread,historically, is this white Wonder loaf.And don't despise the white breadbecause it really, I think,symbolizes the fact that bread and foodhave become plentiful and affordable to all.And that is a feat that weare not really conscious of that much.But it has changed the world.This tiny bread that is tasteless in some waysand has a lot of problemshas changed the world.So what is happening?Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics.With the advent of the Industrial Revolutionwith modernization of agriculturein the last few decades, since the 1960s,food availability, per head, in this world,has increased by 25 percent.And the world population in the meantime has doubled.That means that we have now more food availablethan ever before in human history.And that is the result, directly,of being so successfulat increasing the scale and volume of our production.And this is true, as you can see, for all countries,including the so-called developing countries.What happened to our bread in the meantime?As food became plentiful here,it also meant that we were able to decreasethe number of people working in agricultureto something like, on average, in the high income countries,five percent or less of the population.In the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers.And it frees us all up to do other things --to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food.That is, historically, a really unique situation.Never before has the responsibility to feed the worldbeen in the hands of so few people.And never before have so many peoplebeen oblivious of that fact.So as food became more plentiful, bread became cheaper.And as it became cheaper, bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things.We added in more sugar.We add in raisins and oil and milkand all kinds of things to make bread,from a simple food into kind of a support for calories.And today, bread now is associated with obesity,which is very strange.It is the basic, most fundamental foodthat we've had in the last ten thousand years.Wheat is the most important crop -- the first crop we domesticatedand the most important crop we still grow today.But this is now this strange concoctionof high calories.And that's not only true in this country,it is true all over the world.Bread has migrated to tropical countries,where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgersand where the commutersfind bread much more handy to usethan rice or cassava.So bread has become from a main staple,a source of caloriesassociated with obesityand also a source of modernity,of modern life.And the whiter the bread, in many countries, the better it is.So this is the story of bread as we know it now.But of course the price of mass productionhas been that we moved large-scale.And large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes,destruction of biodiversity --still a lonely emu herein the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields.The costs have been tremendous --water pollution, all the things you know about, destruction of our habitats.What we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about.And this is where I have to query all of you.How many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals?How many of you actually can make a breadin this way, without starting with a bread machineor just some kind of packaged flavor?Can you actually bake bread? Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs?We have become very removedfrom what our bread really is,which, again, evolutionarily speaking,is very strange.In fact not many of you know thatour bread, of course, was not a European invention.It was invented by farmers in Iraqand Syria in particular.The tiny spike on the left to the centeris actually the forefather of wheat.This is where it all comes from,and where these farmers who actually, ten thousand years ago,put us on the road of bread.Now it is not surprisingthat with this massification and large-scale production,there is a counter-movement that emerged --very much also here in California.The counter-movement says, "Let's go back to this.Let's go back to traditional farming.Let's go back to small-scale, to farmers' markets,small bakeries and all that." Wonderful.Don't we all agree? I certainly agree.I would love to go back to Tuscanyto this kind of traditional setting,gastronomy, good food.But this is a fallacy.And the fallacy comes from idealizinga past that we have forgotten about.If we do this, if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farmingwe are going, actually, to relegatethese poor farmers and their husbands --among whom I have lived for many years,working without electricity and water, to try to improve their food production --we relegate them to poverty.What they want are implementsto increase their production:something to fertilize the soil,something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market.We cannot just think that small-scaleis the solution to the world food problem.It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it,if you want to afford it.In fact we do not want this poor womanto work the land like this.If we say just small-scale production,as is the tendency here,to go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Roslingcannot even eat oranges anymorebecause in Scandinavia we don't have oranges.So local food production is out.But also we do not wantto relegate to poverty in the rural areas.And we do not want to relegatethe urban poor to starvation.So we must find other solutions.One of our problems is that world food productionneeds to increase very rapidly --doubling by about 2030.The main driver of that is actually meat.And meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particularis what drives the prices of cereals.That need for animal protein is going to continue.We can discuss alternatives in another talk, perhaps one day,but this is our driving force.So what can we do?Can we find a solution to produce more?Yes. But we need mechanization.And I'm making a real plea here.I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmerto work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice,150,000 times, just to plant a crop and weed it.You cannot ask people to work under these conditions.We need clever low-key mechanizationthat avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we've had.So what can we do?We must feed three billion people in cities.We will not do that through small farmers' marketsbecause these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal.They have low incomes. And they benefitfrom cheap, affordable, safe and diverse food.That's what we must aim for in the next 20 to 30 years.But yes there are some solutions.And let me just do one simple conceptual thing:if I plot science as a proxyfor control of the production process and scale.What you see is that we've startedin the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture,which was sort of small-scale and low-control.We've moved towards large-scale and very high control.What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in therebut go to a kind of regional scale --not just in terms of the scale of the fields,but in terms of the entire food network.That's where we should move.And the ultimate may be, but it doesn't apply to cereals,that we have entirely closed ecosystems --the horticultural systems right at the top left-hand corner.So we need to think differently about agriculture science.Agriculture science for most people -- and there are not many farmersamong you here --has this name of being bad,of being about pollution, about large-scale,about the destruction of the environment.That is not necessary.We need more science and not less. And we need good science.So what kind of science can we have?Well first of all I thinkwe can do much better on the existing technologies.Use biotechnology where useful,particularly in pest and disease resistance.There are also robots, for example,who can recognize weedswith a resolution of half an inch.We have much cleverer irrigation.We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to.And we need to think very dispassionatelyabout the comparative advantagesof small-scale and large-scale.We need to think that land is multi-functional.It has different functions.There are different ways in which we must use it --for residential, for nature, for agriculture purposes.And we also need to re-examine livestock.Go regional and go to urban food systems.I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements.I want to have horticultureand greenhouses on top of residential areas.And I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhousesand from the fermentation of cropsto heat our residential areas.There are all kinds of ways we can do it.We cannot solve the world food problemby using biological agriculture.But we can do a lot more.And the main thing that I would really ask all of youas you go back to your countries, or as you stay here:ask your government for an integrated food policy.Food is as important as energy,as security, as the environment.Everything is linked together.So we can do that. In fact in a densely populated countrylike the River Delta, where I live in the Netherlands,we have combined these functions.So this is not science fiction. We can combine thingseven in a social sense of makingthe rural areas more accessible to people --to house, for example, the chronically sick.There is all kinds of things we can do.But there is something you must do. It's not enough for me to say,"Let's get more bold science into agriculture."You must go backand think about your own food chain.Talk to farmers. When was the last timeyou went to a farm and talked to a farmer?Talk to people in restaurants.Understand where you are in the food chain,where your food comes from.Understand that you are partof this enormous chain of events.And that frees you up to do other things.And above all, to me, food is about respect.It's about understanding, when you eat,that there are also many people who are still in this situation,who are still struggling for their daily food.And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have,to think that doing everything by handis going to be the solution,is really not morally justified.We need to help to lift them out of poverty.We need to make them proud of being a farmerbecause they allow us to survive.Never before, as I said,has the responsibility for foodbeen in the hands of so few.And never before have we had the luxuryof taking it for grantedbecause it is now so cheap.And I think there is nobody else who has expressedbetter, to me, the idea that food, in the end,in our own tradition, is something holy.It's not about nutrients and calories.It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity.Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi,75 years ago, when he spoke about bread.He did not speak about rice, in India. He said,"To those who have to go without two meals a day,God can only appear as bread."And so as I'm finishing my bread here --and I've been baking it, and I'll try not to burn my hands.Let me sharewith those of you here in the first row.Let me share some of the food with you.Take some of my bread.And as you eat it, and as you try it --please come and stand up.Have some of it.I want you to think that every bite connects youto the past and the future:to these anonymous farmers,that first bred the first wheat varieties;and to the farmers of today,who've been making this. And you don't even know who they are.Every meal you eatcontains ingredients from all across the world.Everything makes us so privileged,that we can eat this food, that we don't struggle every day.And that, I think,evolutionarily-speaking is unique.We've never had that before.So enjoy your bread.Eat it, and feel privileged.Thank you very much.(Applause)

So the first question is, why do we need toeven worry about a pandemic threat?What is it that we're concerned about?When I say "we," I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations.We're concerned in the national security community,and of course in the biology community and the public health community.While globalization has increased travel,it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere,all the time, all over the world.And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you.So a plague outbreak in Surat, Indiabecomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event --a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.Katrina showed usthat we cannot completely depend on governmentto have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things.Indeed, an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once.Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu --some of you call it bird flu --which first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s,but we didn't know about it until 1997.At the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1.But we're now up to 55 countries in the world,have had this virus emerge,in either birds, or people or both.In the bird outbreaks we now can seethat pretty much the whole world has seen this virusexcept the Americas.And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment.In domestic birds, especially chickens,it's 100 percent lethal.It's one of the most lethal things we've seenin circulation in the worldin any recent centuries.And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens,and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmerswith the result that there's cover-up.It's also carried on migration patternsof wild migratory aquatic birds.There has been this centralized eventin a place called Lake Chenghai, China.Two years ago the migrating birdshad a multiple eventwhere thousands died because of a mutation occurringin the virus,which made the species range broaden dramatically.So that birds going to Siberia, to Europe, and to Africacarried the virus, which had not previously been possible.We're now seeing outbreaks in human populations --so far, fortunately, small events,tiny outbreaks, occasional clusters.The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two yearsto form two distinct families, if you will,of the H5N1 viral treewith branches in them,and with different attributes that are worrying.So what's concerning us? Well, first of all,at no time in history have we succeeded in makingin a timely fashion, a specific vaccinefor more than 260 million people.It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling.But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effectiveif we have a real outbreak.So one thought is:after 9/11, when the airports closed,our flu season was delayed by two weeks.So the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is justimmediately -- we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human,the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter --let's shut down the airports.However, huge supercomputer analyses,done of the likely effectiveness of this,show that it won't buy us much time at all.And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans.For example, all masks are made in China.How do you get them mobilized around the worldif you've shut all the airports down?How do you get the vaccines moved around the worldand the drugs moved, and whatever may or not be available that would work.So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive.We're worried because this virus, unlike any other fluwe've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meatof the infected animals.We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats,and now also domestic pet dogs.And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets,we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu:seizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.This is not your normal garden-variety flu.It mimics what we now understandabout reconstructing the 1918 flu virus,the last great pandemic,in that it also jumped directly from birds to people.We had evolution over time,and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings:55 percent of people who have become infectedwith H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.And we don't have a huge number of peoplewho got infected and never developed disease.In experimental feeding in monkeysyou can see that it actually downregulatesa specific immune system modulator.The result is that what kills youis not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying,"Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk."The result: most of the deathshave been in people under 30 years of age,robustly healthy young adults.We have seen human-to-human transmissionin at least three clusters --fortunately involving very intimate contact,still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk.Alright, so I've got you nervous.Now you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something.And we have spent a lot of money.Most of the spending in the Bush administrationhas actually been more related to the anthrax resultsand bio-terrorism threat.But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal levelto look at infectious diseases.End result: only 15 stateshave been certified to be able to do mass distributionof vaccine and drugs in a pandemic.Half the states would run out of hospital bedsin the first week, maybe two weeks.And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage.Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble.So what have people been doing with this money?Exercises, drills, all over the world.Let's pretend there's a pandemic.Let's everybody run around and play your role.Main result is that there is tremendous confusion.Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be.And the bottom line, major thing that has come throughin every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge.Nobody knows the chain of command.If it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor,the President of the United States, the head of Homeland Security?In fact, the federal government says it's a guy calledthe Principle Federal Officer,who happens to be with TSA.The government saysthe federal responsibility will basically beabout trying to keep the virus out, which we all know is impossible,and then to mitigate the impactprimarily on our economy.The rest is up to your local community.Everything is about your town, where you live.Well how good a city council you have,how good a mayor you have -- that's who's going to be in charge.Most local facilities would all be competingto try and get their hands on their pieceof the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu,which may or may not be helpful -- I'll get into that --of available vaccines, and any other treatments,and masks, and anything that's been stockpiled.And you'll have massive competition.Now we did purchase a vaccine, you've probably all heard about it,made by Sanofi-Aventis.Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus.The vaccine will probably be useless.So here's where the decisions come in.You're the mayor of your local town.Let's see, should we order that all pets be kept indoors?Germany did that when H5N1 appeared in Germany last year,in order to minimize the spreadbetween households by household cats, dogs and so on.What do we do when we don't have any containment roomswith reverse air that will allow the healthcare workersto take care of patients?These are in Hong Kong; we have nothing like that here.What about quarantine?During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help.We have no uniform policiesregarding quarantine across the United States.And some states have differential policies, county by county.But what about the no-brainer things? Should we close all the schools?Well then what about all the workers? They won't go to workif their kids aren't in school.Encouraging telecommuting? What works?Well the British government did a model of telecommuting.Six weeks they had all people in the banking industrypretend a pandemic was underway.What they found was, the core functions --you know you still sort of had banks,but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines.Nobody was processing the credit cards.Your insurance payments didn't go through.And basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs.And that's just office workers, bankers.We don't know how important hand washing is for flu --shocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot.But actually in scientific community there is great debateabout what percentage of flu transmission between peopleis from sneezing and coughingand what percentage is on your hands.The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question.Can we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masksbecause we don't make them in America anymore,they're all made in China --do we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line,must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask?Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks?In the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kongthat most of transmission was becausepeople were removing their masks improperly.And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask,and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo! They got SARS.It wasn't flying microbes.If you go online right now, you'll get so much phony-baloney information.You'll end up buying -- this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.We don't actually have a standardfor what should be the protective gear for the first responders,the people who will actually be there on the front lines.And Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug,made by Hoffmann-La Roche, patented drug.There is some indicationthat it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak.Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time,well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.A public health survey analyzed the effectthat large-scale Tamiflu use would have,actually shows it counteractiveto public health measures, making matters worse.And here is the other interesting thing:when a human being ingests Tamiflu, only 20 percentis metabolized appropriatelyto be an active compound in the human being.The rest turns into a stable compound,which survives filtration into the water systems,thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry fluand providing them a chanceto breed resistant strains.And we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strainsin both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission,and in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.So I personally think that our life expectancyfor Tamiflu as an effective drugis very limited -- very limited indeed.Nevertheless most of the governmentshave based their whole flu policieson building stockpiles of Tamiflu.Russia has actually stockpiled enoughfor 95 percent of all Russians.We've stockpiled enough for 30 percent.When I say enough, that's two weeks worth.And then you're on your own becausethe pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months.Some of the poorer countriesthat have had the most experience with H5N1 have built up stockpiles;they're already expired. They are already out of date.What do we know from 1918,the last great pandemic?The federal government abdicated most responsibility.And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulationsall over America.Every city, county, state did their own thing.And the rulesand the belief systems were wildly disparate.In some cases all schools, all churches,all public venues were closed.The pandemic circulated three times in 18 monthsin the absence of commercial air travel.The second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave.And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers.But by the time the second wave hitit took such a toll among the healthcare workersthat we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines.Overall we lost 700,000 people.The virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant womenand we don't actually know why.Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds --robustly healthy young adults.It was likened to the plague.We don't actually know how many people died.The low-ball estimate is 35 million.This was based on European and North American data.A new study by Chris Murray at Harvardshows that if you look at the databases that were keptby the Brits in India,there was a 31-fold greater death rate among the Indians.So there is a strong belief that in places of povertythe death toll was far higher.And that a more likely tollis somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million peoplebefore we had commercial air travel.So are we ready?As a nation, no we're not.And I think even those in the leadershipwould say that is the case,that we still have a long ways to go.So what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is,I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything --for yourself, your family, or your employees --unless you've really done your homework.What mask works, what mask doesn't work.How many masks do you need?The Institute of Medicine study felt thatyou could not recycle masks.Well if you think it's going to last 18 months,are you going to buy 18 months worth of masksfor every single person in your family?We don't know -- again with Tamiflu,the number one side effect of Tamiflu isflu-like symptoms.So then how can you tellwho in your family has the fluif everybody is taking Tamiflu?If you expand that out to think of a whole community,or all your employees in your company,you begin to realize how limitedthe Tamiflu option might be.Everybody has come up to me and said,well I'll stockpile water or, I'll stockpile food, or what have you.But really? Do you really have a placeto stockpile 18 months worth of food? Twenty-four months worth of food?Do you want to view the pandemic threatthe way back in the 1950speople viewed the civil defense issue,and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?I don't think that's rational.I think it's about having to be preparedas communities, not as individuals --being prepared as nation,being prepared as state, being prepared as town.And right now most of the preparednessis deeply flawed.And I hope I've convinced you of that,which means that the real job is go out andsay to your local leaders,and your national leaders,"Why haven't you solved these problems?Why are you still thinking thatthe lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu?"And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put.But I guess the other thing to add is,if you do have employees, and you do have a company,I think you have certain responsibilitiesto demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them,and you are trying to plan.At a minimum the British banking plan showed thattelecommuting can be helpful.It probably does reduce exposurebecause people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other,or touching common objectsand sharing things via their hands.But can you sustain your company that way?Well if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.Otherwise you're in trouble.Happy to take your questions.(Applause)Audience member: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic?Laurie Garret: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic, we don't really know.I could give you a bunch of flip, this, that, and the other.But I would say that honestly we don't know.Clearly the bottom line isthe virus eventually attenuates,and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity,and finds other hosts.But we don't really know how and why that happens.It's a very complicated ecology.Audience member: What kind of triggers are you looking for?You know way more than any of us.To say ahh, if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic?LG: The moment that you see any evidenceof serious human-to-human to transmission.Not just intimately between family memberswho took care of an ailing sister or brother,but a community infected --spread within a school,spread within a dormitory, something of that nature.Then I think that there is universal agreementnow, at WHO all the way down:Send out the alert.Audience member: Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful.Can you talk about that?LG: Yeah. There is some evidence that taking Lipitorand other common statins for cholesterol controlmay decrease your vulnerabilityto influenza.But we do not completely understand why.The mechanism isn't clear.And I don't know that there is any wayresponsibly for someone to startmedicating their childrenwith their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature.We have absolutely no idea what that would do.You might be causing some very dangerous outcomesin your children, doing such a thing.Audience member: How far along are we in being able to determinewhether someone is actually carrying, whether somebody has thisbefore the symptoms are full-blown?LG: Right. So I have for a long time saidthat what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic.And our Centers for Disease Controlhas labeled a test they developeda rapid diagnostic.It takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory,in highly skilled hands.I'm thinking dipstick.You could do it to your own kid. It changes color.It tells you if you have H5N1.In terms of where we are in sciencewith DNA identification capacities and so on,it's not that far off.But we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there.Audience member: In the 1918 flu I understand thatthey theorized that there was some attenuationof the virus when it made the leap into humans.Is that likely, do you think, here?I mean 100 percent death rateis pretty severe.LG: Um yeah. So we don't actually knowwhat the lethality wasof the 1918 strain to wild birdsbefore it jumped from birds to humans.It's curious that there is no evidenceof mass die-offs of chickensor household birds across Americabefore the human pandemic happened.That may be because those eventswere occurring on the other side of the worldwhere nobody was paying attention.But the virus clearlywent through one round around the worldin a mild enough formthat the British army in World War Iactually certified that it was not a threatand would not affect the outcome of the war.And after circulating around the worldcame back in a form that was tremendously lethal.What percentage of infected people were killed by it?Again we don't really know for sure.It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with,you had a weakened immune system,you lived in poverty in India or Africa,your likelihood of dying was far greater.But we don't really know.Audience member: One of the things I've heard is thatthe real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia,and that a pneumonia vaccinemay offer you 50 percent better chance of survival.LG: For a long time, researchers in emerging diseaseswere kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threaton the grounds thatback in 1918 they didn't have antibiotics.And that most people who die of regular flu --which in regular flu yearsis about 360,000 people worldwide,most of them senior citizens --and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system.And along comes pneumococcusor another bacteria, streptococcusand boom, they get a bacterial pneumonia.But it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all.And so far in the H5N1 cases in people,similarly bacterial infectionhas not been an issue at all.It's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune systemthat is the key to why people die of this virus.And I would just addwe saw the same thing with SARS.So what's going on here is your body says,your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says,"I don't know what the heck this is.We've never seen anything even remotely like this before."It won't do any good to bring in the sharpshootersbecause those antibodies aren't here.And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillerybecause those T-cells don't recognize it either.So we're going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response,stimulate the total cytokine cascade.The whole immune system swarms into the lungs.And yes they die, drowning in their own fluids, of pneumonia.But it's not bacterial pneumonia.And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine.And I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention.(Applause)

The first half of the 20th centurywas an absolute disaster in human affairs,a cataclysm.We had the First World War,the Great Depression,the Second World Warand the rise of the communist nations.And each one of these forcessplit the world, tore the world apart,divided the world.And they threw up walls --political walls, trade walls,transportation walls,communication walls, iron curtains --which divided peoples and nations.It was only in the second half of the 20th centurythat we slowly began to pull ourselvesout of this abyss.Trade walls began to come tumbling down.Here are some data on tariffs:starting at 40 percent, coming down to less than 5 percent.We globalized the world. And what does that mean?It means that we extended cooperationacross national boundaries;we made the world more cooperative.Transportation walls came tumbling down.You know in 1950 the typical ship carried5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods.Today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons;it can be manned with a smaller crew;and unloaded faster than ever before.Communication walls, I don't have to tell you -- the Internet --have come tumbling down.And of course the iron curtains,political walls have come tumbling down.Now all of this has been tremendous for the world.Trade has increased.Here is just a little bit of data.In 1990, exports from China to the United States:15 billion dollars.By 2007: over 300 billion dollars.And perhaps most remarkably,at the beginning of the 21st century,really for the first time in modern history,growth extended to almost all parts of the world.So China, I've already mentioned,beginning around 1978, around the time of the death of Mao,growth -- ten percent a year.Year after year after year,absolutely incredible.Never before in human historyhave so many people been raised out ofsuch great poverty as happened in China.China is the world's greatest anti-poverty programover the last three decades.India, starting a little bit later,but in 1990, begetting tremendous growth.Incomes at that timeless than $1,000 per year.And over the next 18 yearshave almost tripled.Growth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible.Now Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa --Sub-Saharan Africahas been the area of the worldmost resistant to growth.And we can see the tragedy of Africain the first few bars here.Growth was negative.People were actually getting poorer than their parents,and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been.But at the end of the 20th century,the beginning of the 21st century,we saw growth in Africa.And I think, as you'll see, there's reasons for optimism,because I believe that the best is yet to come.Now why.On the cutting edge todayit's new ideas which are driving growth.And by that I mean it'sproducts for which the research and development costsare really high, and the manufacturing costs are low.More than ever before it is these types of ideaswhich are driving growth on the cutting edge.Now ideas have this amazing property.Thomas Jefferson, I think, really expressed this quite well.He said, "He who receives an idea from mereceives instruction himself, without lessening mine.As he who lights his candle at minereceives light without darkening me."Or to put it slightly differently:one apple feeds one man,but an idea can feed the world.Now this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters.This is practically the model of TED.But what is new is that the greater function of ideasis going to drive growth even more than ever before.This provides a reason whytrade and globalizationare even more important, more powerful than ever before,and are going to increase growth more than ever before.And to explain why this is so, I have a question.Suppose that there are two diseases:one of them is rare, the other one is common,but if they are not treated they are equally severe.If you had to choose, which would you rather have:the common disease or the rare disease?Common, the common -- I think that's absolutely right,and why? Because there are more drugs to treat common diseasesthan there are to treat rare diseases.The reason for this is incentives.It costs about the same to produce a new drugwhether that drug treats 1,000 people,100,000 people, or a million people.But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people.So the incentives are much largerto produce drugs which treat more people.To put this differently: larger markets save lives.In this case misery truly does love company.Now think about the following:if China and India were as rich as the United States is today,the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now.Now we are not there yet, but it is happening.As other countries become richerthe demand for these pharmaceuticalsis going to increase tremendously.And that means an increase incentive to do research and development,which benefits everyone in the world.Larger markets increase the incentiveto produce all kinds of ideas,whether it's software, whether it's a computer chip,whether it's a new design.For the Hollywood people in the audience,this even explains why action movieshave larger budgets than comedies:it's because action movies translate easierinto other languages and other cultures,so the market for those movies is larger.People are willing to invest more,and the budgets are larger.Alright. Well if larger markets increase the incentiveto produce new ideas,how do we maximize that incentive?It's by having one world market, by globalizing the world.The way I like to put this is:one idea. Ideas are meant to be shared,so one idea can serve one world, one market.One idea, one world, one market.Well how else can we create new ideas?That's one reason.Globalize trade.How else can we create new ideas?Well, more idea creators.Now idea creators, they come from all walks of life.Artists and innovators -- many of the people you've seen on this stage.I'm going to focus on scientists and engineersbecause I have some data on that, and I'm a data person.Now, today, less than one-tenth of one percentof the world's population are scientists and engineers.(Laughter)The United States has been an idea leader.A large fraction of those people are in the United States.But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership.And for that I am very grateful.That is a good thing.It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leaderbecause for too long the United States,and a handful of other developed countries,have shouldered the entire burdenof research and development.But consider the following:if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is nowthere would be more than five times as many scientists and engineerscontributing to ideas which benefit everyone,which are shared by everyone.I think of the great Indian mathematician, Ramanujan.How many Ramanujans are there in India todaytoiling in the fields, barely able to feed themselves,when they could be feeding the world?Now we're not there yet.But it is going to happen in this century.The real tragedy of the last century is this:if you think about the world's populationas a giant computer, a massively parallel processor,then the great tragedy has beenthat billions of our processors have been off line.But in this century China is coming on line.India is coming on line.Africa is coming on line.We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century.Here is just some data. This is China.1996: less than one millionnew university students in China per year;2006: over five million.Now think what this means.This means we all benefit when another country gets rich.We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy.That is something that we should embrace --a wealthy China, a wealthy India, a wealthy Africa.We need a greater demand for ideas --those larger markets I was talking about earlier --and a greater supply of ideas for the world.Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic.Globalization is increasing the demandfor ideas, the incentive to create new ideas.Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas.In fact if you look at world historyyou can see some reasons for optimism.From about the beginnings of humanityto 1500: zero economic growth, nothing.1500 to 1800: maybe a little bit of economic growth,but less in a centurythan you expect to see in a year today.1900s: maybe one percent.Twentieth century: a little bit over two percent.Twenty-first century could easily be 3.3, even higher percent.Even at that rate,by 2100 average GDP per capitain the world will be $200,000.That's not U.S. GDP per capita, which will be over a million,but world GDP per capita -- $200,000.That's not that far.We won't make it.But some of our grandchildren probably will.And I should say,I think this is a rather modest prediction.In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy.In Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth.(Laughter)Alright what about problems?What about a great depression?Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression.Here is GDP per capitafrom 1900 to 1929.Now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929,trying to forecast future growth for the United States,not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff,not knowing that we were about to enterthe greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century.What would you have predicted, not knowing this?If you had based your prediction, your forecaston 1900 to 1929you'd have predicted something like this.If you'd been a little more optimistic --say, based upon the Roaring Twenties -- you'd have said this.So what actually happened?We went off a cliff but we recovered.In fact in the second half of the 20th centurygrowth was even higher than anything you would have predictedbased upon the first half of the 20th century.So growth can wash awayeven what appears to be a great depression.Alright. What else?Oil. Oil. This was a big topic.When I was writing up my notes oil was $140 per barrel.So people were asking a question. They were saying,"Is China drinking our milkshake?"(Laughter)And there is some truth to this,in the sense that we have something of a finite resource,and increased growth is going to push up demand for that.But I think I don't have to tell this audiencethat a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing.Moreover, as everyone knows,look -- it's energy, not oil, which counts.And higher oil prices meana greater incentive to invest in energy R&amp;D.You can see this in the data.As oil prices go up, energy patents go up.The world is much better equippedto overcome an increase in the price of oiltoday, than ever in the past,because of what I'm talking about.One idea, one world, one market.So I'm optimisticso long as we hew to these two ideas:to keep globalizing world markets,keep extending cooperation across national boundaries,and keep investing in education.Now the United States has a particularly important roleto play in this:to keep our education system globalized,to keep our education system open to students from all over the world,because our education systemis the candlethat other students come to light their own candles.Now remember here what Jefferson said.Jefferson said, "When they comeand light their candles at ours,they gain light, and we are not darkened."But Jefferson wasn't quite right, was he?Because the truth is,when they light their candles at ours,there is twice as much light available for everyone.So my view is: Be optimistic.Spread the ideas. Spread the light.Thank you.(Applause)

When I was five years oldI fell in love with airplanes.Now I'm talking about the '30s.In the '30s an airplane had two wingsand a round motor,and was always flownby a guy who looked like Cary Grant.He had high leather boots,jodhpurs, an old leather jacket,a wonderful helmetand those marvelous goggles --and, inevitably, a white scarf,to flow in the wind.He'd always walk up to his airplanein a kind of saunter,devil-may-care saunter,flick the cigarette away,grab the girl waiting here, give her a kiss.(Laughter)And then mount his airplane,maybe for the last time.Of course I always wondered what would happenif he'd kissed the airplane first.(Laughter)But this was real romance to me.Everything about flying in those years,which was -- you have to stop and think for a moment --was probably the most advancedtechnological thing going on at the time.So as a youngster,I tried to get close to thisby drawing airplanes,constantly drawing airplanes.It's the way I gota part of this romance.And of course, in a way, when I say romance,I mean in partthe aesthetics of that whole situation.I think the word is the holistic experiencerevolving around a product.The product was that airplane.But it built a romance.Even the parts of the airplanehad French names.Ze fuselage, ze empanage, ze nessal.You know, from a romance language.So that it was something that just got into your spirit.It did mine.And I decided I had to get closer thanjust drawing fantasy airplanes.I wanted to build airplanes.So I built model airplanes.And I found that in doing the model airplanesthe appearance drawings were not enough.You couldn't transfer thoseto the model itself.If you wanted it to flyyou had to learn the disciplineof flying.You had to learn about aeronautics.You had to learn what made an airplanestay in the air.And of course, as a model in those years, you couldn't control it.So it had to be self-righting,and stay up without crashing.So I had to give upthe approach of drawingthe fantasy shapesand convert it to technical drawings --the shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on --and build an airplane over these drawingsthat I knew followed some of the principlesof flying.And in so doing, I could producea model that would fly, stay in the air.And it had, once it was in the air,some of this romance that I was in love with.Well the act of drawing airplanesled me to,when I had the opportunity to choosea course in school,led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering.And when I was sitting in classes --in which no one asked me to draw an airplane --to my surprise.I had to learn mathematics and mechanicsand all this sort of thing.I'd wile away my time drawing airplanesin the class.One day a young man looked over my shoulder,he said, "You draw very well.You should be in the art department."And I said, "Why?"And he said, "Well for one thing, there are more girls there."(Laughter)So my romance was temporarily shifted.(Laughter)And I went into artbecause they appreciated drawing.Studied painting; didn't do very well at that.Went through design,some architecture.Eventually hired myself out as a designer.And for the following 25 years,living in Italy,living in America,I doled out a piece of this romanceto anybody who'd pay for it --this sense, this aesthetic feeling,for the experience revolving arounda designed object.And it exists.Any of you who rode the automobiles --was it yesterday? --at the track, you know the romancerevolving around those high performance cars.Well in 25 yearsI was mostly putting outpieces of this romanceand not getting a lot back inbecause design on calldoesn't always connect you with a circumstancein which you can produce things of this nature.So after 25 years I began to feelas though I was running dry.And I quit.And I started up a very small operation --went from 40 peopleto one,in an effort to rediscover my innocence.I wanted to get backwhere the romance was.And I couldn't choose airplanesbecause they had gotten sort of unromanticat that point,even though I'd done a lot of airplane work,on the interiors.So I chose furniture.And I chose chairs specificallybecause I knew something about them.I'd designed a lot of chairs, over the yearsfor tractors and trucksand submarines --all kinds of things.But not office chairs.So I started doing that.And I found that there were waysto duplicate the same approachthat I used to use on the airplane.Only this time,instead of the product being shaped by the wind,it was shaped by the human body.So the discipline was --as in the airplane you learn a lot abouthow to deal with the air,for a chairyou have to learn a lot about how to dealwith the body,and what the body needs, wants,indicates it needs.And that's the way, ultimatelyafter some ups and downs,I ended up designing the chair I'm going to show you.I should say one more thing. When I was doing thosemodel airplanes,I did everything.I conceived the kind of airplane.I basically engineered it.I built it.And I flew it.And that's the way I work now.When I started this chairit was not a preconceived notion.Design nowadays, if you mean it,you don't start with styling sketches.I started with a lot of loose ideas,roughly eight or nine years ago.And the loose ideas had somethingto do with what I knew happened withpeople in the office,at the work place -- people who worked,and used task seating,a great many of them sitting in front of a computerall day long.And I felt,the one thing they don't need,is a chair that interfereswith their main reason for sitting there.So I took the approachthat the chair should do as much for themas humanly possibleor as mechanistically possibleso that they didn't have to fuss with it.So my idea was that,instead of sitting down and reachingfor a lot of controls,that you would sit on the chair,and it would automatically balance your weightagainst the force requiredto recline.Now that may not mean a lot to some of you.But you know most good chairs do reclinebecause it's beneficial to open up this jointbetween your legs and your upper bodyfor better breathingand better flow.So that if you sit downon my chair,whether you're five feet tallor six foot six,it always deals with your weightand transfers the amount of force requiredto reclinein a way that you don't have to lookfor something to adjust.I'll tell you right up front,this is a trade off.There are drawbacks to this.One is: you can'taccommodate everybody.There are some very light people,some extremely heavy people,maybe people with a lot of bulk up top.They begin to fall off the end of your chart.But the compromise, I felt,was in my favorbecause most people don't adjust their chairs.They will sit in them forever.I had somebody on the bus out to the racetracktell me about his sister calling him.He said she had one of the new, better chairs.She said, "Oh I love it."She said, "But it's too high."(Laughter)So he said, "Well I'll come over and look at it."He came over and looked at it.He reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down.She said, "Oh it's wonderful. How did you do that?"And he showed her the lever.Well, that's typicalof a lot of us working in chairs.And why should youget a 20-page manualabout how to run a chair?(Laughter)I had one for a wristwatch once. 20 pages.Anyway, I felt that it was importantthat you didn't have to make an adjustmentin order to get this kind of action.The other thing I felt was that armrestshad never really been properly approachedfrom the standpoint of how muchof an aid they could beto your work life.But I felt it was too much to askto have to adjust each individual armrestin order to get it where you wanted.So I spent a long time.I said I worked eight or nine years on it.And each of these things went alongsort of in parallelbut incrementally were a problem of their own.I worked a long time on figuring outhow to move the arms over a much greater arc --that is up and down --and make them a lot easier,so that you didn't have to use a button.And so after many trials, many failures,we came up with a very simple arrangementin which we could just moveone arm or the other.And they go up easily.And stop where you want.You can put them down, essentially out of the way.No arms at all.Or you can pull them up where you want them.And this was another thing that I felt,while not nearly as romanticas Cary Grant,nevertheless begins tograb a little bit of aestheticoperation, aesthetic performanceinto a product.The next area that was of interest to mewas the fact that recliningwas a very important factor.And the more you can recline,in a way, the better it is.The more the angle between here and here opens up --and nowadays, with a screen in front of you,you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline,so we keep it at more or less the same level --but you transfer weightoff your tailbones.Would everybody put their hand under their bottomand feel their tailbone?(Laughter)You feel that bone under there?(Laughter)Just your own.(Laughter)There's two of them, one on either side.All the weight of your upper torso --your arms, your head --goes right down through your back,your spine, into those bones when you sit.And that's a lot of load.Just relieving your arms with armreststakes 20 percent of that load off.Now that, if your spine is not held in a good position,will help bend your spine the wrong way, and so on.So to unloadthat great weight --if that indeed exists --you can recline.When you recline you take away a lot of that loadoff your bottom end, and transfer it to your back.At the same time, as I say, you open up this joint.And breathability is good.But to do that, if you have anyamount of recline,it gets to the point where you need a headrestbecause nearly always,automatically hold your headin a vertical position, see?As I recline, my head says more or less vertical.Well if you're reclined a great deal,you have to use muscle forceto hold your head there.So that's where a headrest comes in.Now headrest is a challengebecause you want it to adjustenough so that it'll fit,you know, a tall guy and a short girl.So here we are.I've got five inches of adjustment herein order to get the headrest in the right place.But then I knew from experienceand looking around in officeswhere there were chairs with headreststhat nobody would ever botherto reach back and turn a knoband adjust the headrest to put it in position.And you need it in a different positionwhen you're upright, then when you're reclined.So I knew that had to be solved, and had to be automatic.So if you watch this chairas I recline, the headrest comes upto meet my neck.Ideally you want to put the head supportin the cranial area, right there.So that part of it took a long timeto work out.And there is a variety of other things: the shape of the cushions,the gel we put.We stole the idea from bicycle seats,and put gel in the cushionsand in the armreststo absorb point load --distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots.You cant hit your elbowon bottom.And I did want to demonstratethe fact that the chair can accommodate people.While you're sitting in it you can adjust itdown for the five-footer,or you can adjust itfor the six-foot-six guy --all within the scope of a few simple adjustments.(Applause)

So how would you run a whole country without oil?That's the question that sort of hit mein the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago.It never left my brain.And I started playing with it more like a puzzle.The original thought I had: this must be ethanol.So I went out and researched ethanol,and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country.About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen,until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth,which is, you actually use moreclean electrons than the ones you getinside a car, if you use hydrogen.So that is not going to be the path to go.And then sort of through a process ofwandering around, I got to the thoughtthat actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars,in a way that is convenient and affordable,you could get to a solution.Now I started this from a point of view thatit has to be something that scales en masse.Not how do you build one car,but how do you scale this so that it can becomesomething that is used by 99 percent of the population?The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as goodas any car that you would have today.So one, it has to be more convenient than a car.And two, it has be more affordable than today's cars.Affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right?Alright? That's not something that we can finance or buy today.And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight.So we're bound with the laws of physicsand the laws of economics.And so the thought that I started with washow do you do this, still within the boundaryof the science we know today --no time for science fair, no time for playing around with thingsor waiting for the magic battery to show up.How do you do it within the economics that we have today?How do you do it from the power of the consumer up?And not from the power of an edict down.On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon,I actually found out that the answer comesfrom separating between the car ownershipand the battery ownership.In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic"batteries not included."Now if you separate between the two,you could actually answer the need for a convenient carby creating a network,by creating a network before the cars show up.The network has two components in them.First component is you charge the car whenever you stop --ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drivefor about two hours and park for about 22 hours.If you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoonthe ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute.And so the first thought that came to mind is,everywhere we park we have electric power.Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world,like Scandinavia, you already have that.If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater,when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work.Now that last mile,last foot, in a sense,is the first step of the infrastructure.The second step of the infrastructure needs to take careof the range extension.See we're bound by today's technology on batteries,which is about 120 miles if you want to stay withinreasonable space and weight limitations.120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people.But you never want to get stuck.So what we added is a second element to our network,which is a battery swap system.You drive. You take your depleted battery out.A full battery comes on. And you drive on.You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine.It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash.And a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in, andwithin two minutes you're back on the roadand you can go again.If you had charge spots everywhere,and you had battery swap stations everywhere,how often would you do it? And it ends upthat you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station.As a matter of fact, we added to the contract.We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a yearwe start paying you moneybecause it's an inconvenience.Then we looked at the question of the affordability.We looked at the question, what happens when the battery isdisconnected from the car.What is the cost of that battery?Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive.What we found out, when you move from molecules to electrons,something interesting happens.We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again.The battery is not the gas tank, in a sense.Remember in your car you have a gas tank.You have the crude oil.And you have refining and delivery of that crude oilas what we call petrol or gasoline.The battery in this sense, is the crude oil.We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollarsas the gas tank.But the crude oil is replaced with a battery.Just it doesn't burn. It consumes itselfstep after step after step.It has 2,000 life cycles these days.And so it's sort of a mini well.We were asked in the past when we bought an electric carto pay for the entire well, for the life of the car.Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car.In a sense what we've done iswe've created a new consumable.You, today, buy gasoline miles.And we created electric miles.And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number.Today 2010, in volume,when we come to market, it is eight cents a mile.Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means --in the average consumerenvironment we're in in the U.S.20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50, a buck 60 a gallon.That's cheaper than today's gasoline, even in the U.S.In Europe where taxes are in place,that's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel.But e-miles follow Moore's Law.They go from eight cents a mile in 2010,to four cents a mile in 2015,to two cents a mile by 2020.Why? Because batteries life cycle improve --a bit of improvement on energy density, which reduces the price.And these prices are actually with clean electrons.We do not use any electrons that come from coal.So in a sense this isan absolute zero-carbon, zero-fossil fuelelectric mile at two cents a mile by 2020.Now even if we get to 40 miles per gallonby 2020, which is our desire.Imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road.That is an 80 cent gallon.An 80 cent gallon means, if the entire Pacificwould convert to crude oil,and we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it,they still can't compete with two cents a mile.That's a new economic factor,which is fascinating to most people.Now this would have been a wonderful paper.That's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments.And some governments told me that it's fascinatingthat the younger generation actually thinks about these things.(Laughter)Until I got to thetrue young global leader, Shimon Peres, President of Israel,and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me.First he let me go to the prime minister of the country,who told me, if you can find the money you need for this network,200 million dollars,and if you can find a car companythat will build that car in mass volume,in two million cars -- that's what we needed in Israel --I'll give you country to invest the 200 million into.Peres thought that was a great idea.So we went out, and we looked at all the car companies.We sent letters to all the car companies.Three of them never showed up. One of them asked usif we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount.But one of them Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault and Nissan,when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating.He said hybrids are like mermaids.When you want a fish you get a woman andwhen you need a woman you get a fish.(Laughter)And Ghosn came up and said,"I have the car, Mr. Peres; I will build you the cars."And actually true to form, Renault has put a billion and a half dollarsin building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of modelthat will come into the market in mass volume --mass volume being the first year, 100 thousand cars.It's the first mass-volume electric car,zero-emission electric car in the market.I was running, as Chris said,to be the CEO of a large software company called SAPAnd then Peres said, "Well won't you run this project?"And I said, "I'm ready for CEO" And he said,"Oh no no no no no. You've got to explain to me,what is more important than saving your country and saving the world,that you would go and do?"And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place.We then decided to scale it up.We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark.And Denmark set this beautiful policy;it's called the IQ test.It's inversely proportional to taxes.They put 180 percent tax on gasoline carsand zero tax on zero-emission cars.So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros.If you buy our car it's about 20,000 Euros.If you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country.(Laughter)We then were sort of coined as the guyswho run only in small islands.I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island,but Israel is an island -- it's a transportation island.If your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen.(Laughter)If you're thinking about it in terms of islands,we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find,and that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia.It's got three centers --in Brisbane, in Melbourne, in Sydney --and one freeway, one electric freeway that connects them.The next islandwas not too hard to find, and that was Hawaii.We decided to come into the U.S.and pick the two best places --the one where you didn't need any range extension.Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery.And if you really have a long day you can switch,and keep on driving around the island.The second one was the San Francisco Bay Areawhere Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors.He decided that he's going to take overthe state, unofficially, and then officially,and then created this beautiful Region One policy.In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you havethe highest concentration of Priuses,but you also have the perfect range extender.It's called the other car.As we stared scaling it upwe looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.?Why is this a big issue?And the most fascinating thing we've learned is that,when you have small problems on the individual level,like the price of gasoline to drive every morning.You don't notice it, but when the aggregate comes upyou're dead. Alright?So the price of oil, much likelots of other curves that we've seen,goes along a depletion curve.The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground.And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground.It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out.You think, well it's been up, it's been down,its been up, it's going to keep on going up and down.Here is the problem:at 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago,the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil.Then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 --sometimes it's 40, sometimes it's 50.Now we're running a stimulus package.It's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package.We're going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and 2015,somewhere in that space.What happens when the economy recovers?By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new carseven at the pace we're going at right now.That's another 30 percent demand on oil.That is another 25 million barrels a day.That's all the U.S. usage today.In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak.And then we do the OPEC stimulus packagealso known as 200 dollars a barrel.We take our money and we give it away.You know what happens at that point?We go back down. It's going to go up and down.And the downs are going to be much longerand the ups are going to be much shorter.And that's the difference between problems that are additive,like CO2, which we go slowly up and then we tip,and problems that are depletive,in which we lose what we have,which oscillate, and they oscillate untilwe lose everything we've got.Now we actually looked at what the answer would be.Right? Remember in the campaign: one millionhybrid cars by 2015.That is 0.5 percent of the U.S. oil consumption.That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world.That won't do much difference.We looked at an MIT study:ten million electric cars on the global roads.Ten million out of 500 million we will add between now and then.That is the most pessimistic number you can have.It's also the most optimistic numberbecause it means we will scale this industryfrom 100 thousand cars is 2011,to 10 million cars by 2016 --100 x growth in less than five years.You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars.We have 10 million cars by region.That's an enormous amount of cars.China is adding those cars --India, Russia, Brazil.We have all these regions.Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline.They'll be the first in line to get offbecause their prices are high.China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declarethat no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it.The Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problembecause most people in India fill two or three gallons every time.For them to get a battery that goes 120 milesis an extension on range, not a reduction in range.We're the only ones who don't have the price set right.We don't have the industry set right.We don't have any incentive to go and resolve itacross the U.S.Now where is the car industry on that?Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves.They basically looked at it and said, "Car 1.0we'll solve everything within the car itself."No infrastructure, no problem.We forgot about the entire chain around us.All this stuff that happens around.We are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 --a whole new market, a whole new business model.The business model in which the money that is actually coming in,to drive the car --the minutes, the miles if you want,that you are all familiar with --subsidize the price of the car,just like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles.And some of it will go back to the car maker.Some of it will go back to your own pocket.But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars.You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills.In Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmarkfrom windmills, not from oil.In Israel, we've asked to put a solar farmin the south of Israel.And people said, "Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for."And we said, "What if we had proven that in the same spacewe found oil for the country for the next hundred years?"And they said, "We tried. There isn't any."We said, "No no, but what if we prove it?"And they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up,instead of digging down.These are perfect matches to one another.Now all you need is about 10 percentof the electricity generated.Think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years.That's one percent a year.Now when we're looking at solving big problems,we need to start thinking in two numbers.And those are not 20 percent by 2020.The two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil --and scale it infinity.And when we go to COP15 at the end of this yearwe can't stop thinking of padding CO2.We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countriesthat are willing to go to this kind of scale.One car emits four tons.And actually 700 and change million cars todayemit 2.8 billion tons of CO2.That's, in the additive, about 25 percent of our problem.Cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world's CO2 emissions.We have to come and attack this problemwith a focus, with an effort that actually says,we're going to go to zero before the world ends.I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S.I shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr., who is one of my idols.I told him one of the reasons thathis uncle was rememberedis because he said we're going to send a man to the moon,and we'll do it by the end of the decade.We didn't say we're going to send a man 20 percent to the moon.And there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him.(Laughter)He actually shared with me another story, which is from about 200 years ago.200 years ago, in Parliament, in Great Britain,there was a long argumentover economy versus morality.25 percent -- just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars --25 percent of their energyfor the entire industrial world in the U.K.came from a source of energy that was immoral:human slaves.And there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves?And what would it do to our economy?And people said, "Well we need to take time to do it.Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kidsand keep the slaves.And after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery,and the industrial revolution started within less than one year.And the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth.We have to make the right moral decision.We have to make it immediately.We need to have presidential leadershipjust like we had in Israel that said we will end oil.And we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years,but within this presidential termbecause if we don't, we will lose our economy,right after we'd lost our morality.Thank you all very much.(Applause)



jacek_utko_asks_can_design_save_the_newspaper
1023885

Newspapers are dying for a few reasons.Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news, and advertisers follow them.Your iPhone, your laptop,is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday.And we should save trees in the end.So it's enough to bury any industry.So, should we rather ask, "Can anything save newspapers?"There are several scenarios for the future newspaper.Some people say it should be free;it should be tabloid, or even smaller: A4;it should be local, run by communities,or niche, for some smaller groups like business --but then it's not free; it's very expensive.It should be opinion-driven;less news, more views.And we'd rather read it during breakfast,because later we listen to radio in a car,check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV.Sounds nice, but this can only buy time.Because in the long run,I think there is no reason, no practical reasonfor newspapers to survive.So what can we do?(Laughter)Let me tell you my story.20 years ago, Bonnier, Swedish publisher,started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc.After a few years, they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe.They were run by an inexperienced staff,with no visual culture, no budgets for visuals --in many places there were not even art directors.I decided to be -- to work for them as an art director.Before, I was an architect, and my grandmother asked me once,"What are you doing for a living?"I said, "I'm designing newspapers.""What? There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters"(Laughter)And she was right. I was very frustrated, until one day.I came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.And I had a revelation. I thought,"These guys took some creepy,run-down entertainment,and put it to the highest possible level of performance art."I thought "Oh my God, maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers."And I did. We started to redesign them, one by one.The front page became our signature.It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers.I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation.My approach was very egotistic.I wanted my artistic statement,my interpretation of reality.I wanted to make posters, not newspapers.Not even magazines: posters.We were experimenting with type,with illustration, with photos. And we had fun.Soon it started to bring results.In Poland, our pages were named"Covers of the Year" three times in a row.Other examples you can see here are fromLatvia, Lithuania, Estonia --the central European countries.But it's not only about the front page.The secret is that we were treatingthe whole newspaper as one piece,as one composition -- like music.And music has a rhythm, has ups and downs.And design is responsible for this experience.Flipping through pages is readers experience,and I'm responsible for this experience.We treated two pages, both spreads, as a one page,because that's how readers perceive it.You can see some Russian pages here which got many awardson biggest infographic competition in Spain.But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design.Just a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland,they name it the World's Best-Designed Newspaper.And two years later,the same award came to Estonia.Isn't amazing?What really makes it amazing: that the circulation of these newspaperswere growing too.Just some examples:in Russia, plus 11 after one year,plus 29 after three years of the redesign.Same in Poland: plus 13, up to 35 percentraise of circulation after three years.You can see on a graph,after years of stagnation, the paper started to grow,just after redesign.But the real hit was in Bulgaria.And that is really amazing.Did design do this?Design was just a part of the process.And the process we made was not about changing the look,it was about improving the product completely.I took an architectural rule about function and formand translated it into newspaper content and design.And I put strategy at the top of it.So first you ask a big question: why we do it? What is the goal?Then we adjust the content accordingly.And then, usually after two months, we start designing.My bosses, in the beginning, were very surprised.Why am I asking all of these business questions,instead of just showing them pages?But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer:to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end.So what is the lesson behind it?The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product.It can change your workflow -- actually, it can change everything in your company;it can turn your company upside down.It can even change you.And who's responsible? Designers.Give power to designers.(Applause)But the second is even more important.You can live in a small poor country, like me.You can work for a small company,in a boring branch.You can have no budgets, no people --but still can put your work to the highest possible level.And everybody can do it.You just need inspiration, vision and determination.And you need to remember that to be goodis not enough.Thank you.



jacqueline_novogratz_on_an_escape_from_poverty
874087

I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years,and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple withis how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?So often, we look at dollar terms --people making less than a dollar or two or three a day.And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look atincome as only one variable.Because really, it's a condition about choice,and the lack of freedom.And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for methe understanding that I have.It was in Kenya, and I want to share it with you.I was with my friend Susan Meiselas, the photographer,in the Mathare Valley slums.Now, Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa.It's about three miles out of Nairobi,and it's a mile long and about two-tenths of a mile wide,where over half a million peoplelive crammed in these little tin shacks,generation after generation, renting them,often eight or 10 people to a room.And it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs:a hard place to grow up.And when we were walking through the narrow alleys,it was literally impossible not to step in theraw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.But at the same time it was alsoimpossible not to see the human vitality,the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there:women washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry.I met this woman, Mama Rose,who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years,where she lives with her seven children.Four sleep in one twin bed,and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor.And she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk,and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside.It was also the day after the inauguration,and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe.And I would see kids on the street corners,and they'd say "Obama, he's our brother!"And I'd say "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too."And they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!"And it was here that I met Jane.I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face,and I asked her to tell me her story.She started off by telling me her dream. She said, "I had two.My first dream was to be a doctor,and the second was to marry a good manwho would stay with me and my family,because my mother was a single mom,and couldn't afford to pay for school fees.So I had to give up the first dream, and I focused on the second."She got married when she was 18, had a baby right away.And when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with a second child,her mom died and her husband left her -- married another woman.So she was again in Mathare, with no income, no skill set, no money.And so she ultimately turned to prostitution.It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it.She would go into the city at night with about 20 girls,look for work, and sometimes come back with a few shillings,or sometimes with nothing.And she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliationand the embarrassment of it all."In 2001, her life changed.She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization, Jamii Bora,that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were,as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings.And so she spent a year to save 50 dollars,and started borrowing, and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine.She started tailoring.And that turned into what she does now,which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets,and for about three dollars and 25 cents she buys an old ball gown.Some of them might be ones you gave.And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons,and makes these frothy confections that she sells to womenfor their daughter's Sweet 16 or first Holy Communion --those milestones in a life that people want to celebrateall along the economic spectrum.And she does really good business. In fact, I watched herwalk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it,there was a crowd of women around her, buying these dresses.And I reflected, as I was watching her sell the dresses,and also the jewelry that she makes,that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day.And by many definitions she is no longer poor.But she still lives in Mathare Valley.And so she can't move out.She lives with all of that insecurity,and in fact, in January, during the ethnic riots,she was chased from her home and had to find a new shackin which she would live.Jamii Bora understands that and understandsthat when we're talking about poverty,we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum.And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations,loans and investments that will go the long term with them,they built a low-cost housing development,about an hour outside Nairobi central.And they designed it from the perspective ofcustomers like Jane herself,insisting on responsibility and accountability.So she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage --of the total value, or about 400 dollars in savings.And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty.And in the next couple of weeks, she's going to beamong the first 200 families to move into this development.When I asked her if she feared anything,or whether she would miss anything from Mathare,she said, "What would I fearthat I haven't confronted already?I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all."And she said, "What would I miss?You think I will miss the violence or the drugs? The lack of privacy?Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come homeat the end of the day?" She said "If you gave me 10 minutesmy bags would be packed."I said, "Well what about your dreams?"And she said, "Well, you know,my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl.But if I think about it, I thought I wanted a husband,but what I really wanted was a familythat was loving. And I fiercely love my children, and they love me back."She said, "I thought that I wanted to be a doctor,but what I really wanted to be was somebodywho served and healed and cured.And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have,that two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients.And I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.You are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'"And she said, "I'm not a doctor who gives out pills.But maybe me, I give out something betterbecause I give them hope."And in the middle of this economic crisis,where so many of us are inclined to pull inwith fear, I think we're well suited totake a cue from Jane and reach out,recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary.Because when systems are broken,like the ones that we're seeing around the world,it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation.It's an opportunity to truly build a worldwhere we can extend services and productsto all human beings, so that they canmake decisions and choices for themselves.I truly believe it's where dignity starts.We owe it to the Janes of the world.And just as important, we owe it to ourselves.Thank you.(Applause)



tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web
1274103

Time flies.It's actually almost 20 years agowhen I wanted to reframe the way we use information,the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.Now, 20 years on, at TED,I want to ask your help in a new reframing.So going back to 1989,I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.Nobody really did anything with it, pretty much.But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens --18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side,as a sort of a play project,kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.And so he gave me the time to code it up.So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like:hypertext protocol, HTTP;the idea of URLs, these names for thingswhich started with HTTP.I wrote the code and put it out there.Why did I do it?Well, it was basically frustration.I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineerin this huge, very exciting lab,lots of people coming from all over the world.They brought all sorts of different computers with them.They had all sorts of different data formats,all sorts, all kinds of documentation systems.So that, in all that diversity,if I wanted to figure out how to build somethingout of a bit of this and a bit of this,everything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine,I had to learn to run some new program,I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.And these were all incompatible.It was just very frustrating.The frustration was all this unlocked potential.In fact, on all these discs there were documents.So if you just imagined them allbeing part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky,say on the Internet,then life would be so much easier.Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skinand even if people don't read your memo --actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.He had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.(Laughter)But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explainwhat the web was like.It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no webso things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.I can show somebody a piece of hypertext,a page which has got links,and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page.Not impressive.You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.What was difficult was to get them to imagine:so, imagine that that link could have goneto virtually any document you could imagine.Alright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.Well, some people did.So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.And that is what has made it most fun.That has been the most exciting thing,not the technology, not the things people have done with it,but actually the community, the spirit of all these peoplegetting together, sending the emails.That's what it was like then.Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again.I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents --I said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"And you did.Thanks.It's been a blast, hasn't it?I mean, it has been quite interestingbecause we've found out that the things that happen with the webreally sort of blow us away.They're much more than we'd originally imaginedwhen we put together the little, initial websitethat we started off with.Now, I want you to put your data on the web.Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.There is still a huge frustrationthat people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.What do you mean, "data"? What's the difference -- documents, data?Well, documents you read, OK?More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it --one of the great TED Talks.Hans put up this presentationin which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors --he showed income levels on one axisand he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.So, he'd taken this data and made a presentationwhich just shattered a lot of myths that people hadabout the economics in the developing world.He put up a slide a little bit like this.It had underground all the dataOK, data is brown and boxy and boring,and that's how we think of it, isn't it?Because data you can't naturally use by itselfBut in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our livesand it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.In this case, Hans had put the data togetherhe had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.He had put it together,combined it into something more interesting than the original piecesand then he'd put it into this software,which I think his son developed, originally,and produces this wonderful presentation.And Hans made a pointof saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."And I was happy to see that at the party last nightthat he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."So I want us now to think aboutnot just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did,but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the weband so virtually everything you can imagine is on the weband then calling that linked data.The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.If you want to put something on the web there are three rules:first thing is that those HTTP names --those things that start with "http:" --we're using them not just for documents now,we're using them for things that the documents are about.We're using them for people, we're using them for places,we're using them for your products, we're using them for events.All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it upand I do the web thing with it and I fetch the datausing the HTTP protocol from the web,I will get back some data in a standard formatwhich is kind of useful data that somebody might like to knowabout that thing, about that event.Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person,where they were born, things like that.So the second rule is I get important information back.Third rule is that when I get back that informationit's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born,it's got relationships.Data is relationships.Interestingly, data is relationships.This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationshipthen the other thing that it's related tois given one of those names that starts HTTP.So, I can go ahead and look that thing up.So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; thenI can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in,and the population of it, and so on.So I can browse this stuff.So that's it, really.That is linked data.I wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years agoand soon after that, things started to happen.The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lotsof these boxes that Hans had,and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.It's not just a whole lot of other plants.It's not just a root supplying a plant,but for each of those plants, whatever it is --a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data --they get to look at all the dataand they get it connected together,and the really important thing about datais the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.So, linked data.The meme went out there.And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlinwho was one of the first people to put interesting things up,he noticed that Wikipedia --you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopediawith lots and lots of interesting documents in it.Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes.And in most information boxes, there's data.So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia,and put it into a blob of linked dataon the web, which he called dbpedia.Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slideand if you actually go and look up Berlin,you'll find that there are other blobs of datawhich also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin,you'll end up pulling up these other things as well.And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK?Let's think about data for a bit.Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thingthat the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important,there's scientific data, there's personal data,there's weather data, there's data about events,there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.I'm just going to mention a few of themso that you get the idea of the diversity of it,so that you also see how much unlocked potential.Let's start with government data.Barack Obama said in a speech,that he -- American government data would be available on the Internetin accessible formats.And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.That's important. Why is it important?Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important,but that data -- this is the data from all the government departmentsThink about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.It's actual useful. It's got value.I can use it in my company.I could use it as a kid to do my homework.So we're talking about making the place, making the world run betterby making this data available.In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some datain a government department, often you find thatthese people, they're very tempted to keep it --Hans calls it database hugging.You hug your database, you don't want to let it gountil you've made a beautiful website for it.Well, I'd like to suggest that rather --yes, make a beautiful website,who am I to say don't make a beautiful website?Make a beautiful website, but firstgive us the unadulterated data,we want the data.We want unadulterated data.OK, we have to ask for raw data now.And I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?Can you say "raw"?Audience: Raw.Tim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"?Audience: Data.TBL: Can you say "now"?Audience: Now!TBL: Alright, "raw data now"!Audience: Raw data now!Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excusespeople come up with to hang onto their dataand not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.And it's not just America. It's all over the world.And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well.So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very consciousof the huge challenges that human society has right now --curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's,understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable,understanding how the world works.The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists --they have half-formed ideas in their head,they try to communicate those over the web.But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the momentis on databases, often sitting in their computers,and actually, currently not shared.In fact, I'll just go into one area --if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example,drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming outbecause scientists in that field realizethis is a great way of getting out of those silos,because they had their genomics data in one databasein one building, and they had their protein data in another.Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data --and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask,I wouldn't ask -- they would.What proteins are involved in signal transductionand also related to pyramidal neurons?Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that questionbecause nobody has asked that question before.You get 223,000 hits --no results you can use.You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together --32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those propertiesand you can look at.The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist --questions which actually bridge across different disciplines --is really a complete sea change.It's very very important.Scientists are totally stymied at the moment --the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked upand we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutionsand has nothing to do with you.But, that's not true.In fact, data is about our lives.You just -- you log on to your social networking site,your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend."Bing! Relationship. Data.You say, "This photograph, it's about -- it depicts this person. "Bing! That's data. Data, data, data.Every time you do things on the social networking site,the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it --and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.But, when you go to another linked data site --and let's say this is one about travel,and you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group,"you can't get over the walls.The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it --tremendous frustration.The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operabilitybetween social networking sites.We need to do that with linked data.One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMapThe OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now --The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater,I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back.And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org,and you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.I did that. Me!I did that to the map. I just did that!I put that up on there. Hey, you know what?If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bitand it creates an incredible resourcebecause everybody else does theirs.And that is what linked data is all about.It's about people doing their bitto produce a little bit, and it all connecting.That's how linked data works.You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on therebut you know to demand it.And we've practiced that.So, linked data -- it's huge.I've only told you a very small number of thingsThere are data in every aspect of our lives,every aspect of work and pleasure,and it's not just about the number of places where data comes,it's about connecting it together.And when you connect data together, you get powerin a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.You get this really huge power out of it.So, we're at the stage nowwhere we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea.And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because --even though there's not an immediate return on the investmentbecause it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it --they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does thingswhich would be good if everybody else did them.OK, so it's called linked data.I want you to make it.I want you to demand it.And I think it's an idea worth spreading.Thanks.(Applause)



evan_williams_on_listening_to_twitter_users

Four years ago, on the TED stage,I announced a company I was working with at the timecalled Odeo.And because of that announcement,we got a big article in The New York Times,which led to more press, which led to more attention,and me deciding to become CEO of that company --whereas I was just an adviser --and raising a round of venture capitaland ramping up hiring.One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey,and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo,Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of yearsthat was based around sending simple status updates to friends.We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo,so we kind of put two and two together,and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo.Now, it's hard to justify doing a side projectat a startup, where focus is so critical,but I had actually launched Blogger as a side projectto my previous company,thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side,and it ended up taking over not only the company,but my life for the next five or six years.So I learned to follow huncheseven though you can't necessarily justify themor know where they're going to go.And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time.So, for those of you unfamiliar,Twitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept.You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less,and people who are interested in you get those updates.If they're really interested,they get the update as a text message on their cell phone.So, for instance, I may Twitter right nowthat I'm giving a talk at TED.And in my case, when I hit send,up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds.Now, the fundamental idea is that Twitterlets people share moments of their liveswhenever they want,be they momentous occasionsor mundane ones.It is by sharing these moments as they're happeningthat lets people feel more connected and in touch,despite distance, and in real time.This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning,and what got us excited.What we didn't anticipate was the many, many other usesthat would evolve from this very simple system.One of the things we realizedwas how important Twitter could be during real-time events.When the wildfires broke out in San Diego,in October of 2007,people turned to Twitter to report what was happeningand to find information from neighborsabout what was happening around them.But it wasn't just individuals.The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well,and put a Twitter feed on the front page,and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Crossused it to dispense news and updates as well.At this event, dozens of people here are Twitteringand thousands of people around the world are following alongbecause they want to know what it feels like to be hereand what's happening.Among the other interesting things that have cropped upare many things from businesses,from marketing and communications and predictable things,to an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truckthat drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops,causing a line to form around the block.Politicians have recently begun Twittering.In fact, there are 47 members of Congresswho currently have Twitter accounts.And they're tweeting, in some cases,from behind closed-door sessions with the President.In this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.The President himself is our most popular Twitter user,although his tweets have dropped off as of late,while Senator McCain's have picked up.As have this guy's.Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium:you send one message and it goes out to everybody,and you receive the messages you're interested in.One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitterwas by inventing a way to reply to a specific personor a specific message.So, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using hereto reply to one of his fans,was completely invented by users,and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popularand then we made it easier.This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system.Another is via the API.We built an application-programming interface,which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of softwarethat can send Twitter updates --interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry --as well as things likea device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicksor a plant Twitter when it needs water.Probably the most important third-party developmentcame from a little company in Virginia called Summize.Summize built a Twitter search engine.And they tapped into the factthat, if you have millions of people around the worldtalking about what they're doing and what's around them,you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or eventwhile it's going on.This really changed how we perceived Twitter.For instance, here's what people are saying about TED.This is another way that our mind was shifted,and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.We liked this so much we actually bought the companyand are folding it into the main product.This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways,but it introduces new use cases as well.One of my favorites is what happened a few months agowhen there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.Some users figured outthat they would Twitter when they found gas --where it was, and how much it cost --and then appended the keyword "#atlgas"which let other people search for that and find gas themselves.And this trend of people using this communication networkto help each other outgoes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.It's happened more and more lately,whether it's raising money for homeless peopleor to dig wells in Africaor for a family in crisis.People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitterin a matter of days on several occasions.It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information,more good things happen.I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter.I've learned to follow the hunch,but never assume where it will go.Thanks.(Applause)Chris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.So, look, if we could have this screen live.This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can doafter they've been to an event.It's totally intimidating.So, this would be the Twitter search screen.So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter.For example: "Evan Williams.""Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED.""Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Evan Williams --"Oh."Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED.Worst talk ever!" (Laughter)Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks.CA: Just kidding.But, literally in the eight minutes he was talking,there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.So he'll see every aspect of the reaction:the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer,the fact that it came out of TED.I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way.You have build something very fascinating,and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.So, thank you very much, Evan. EW: Thank you.CA: That was very interesting.

Let's talk trash.You know, we had to be taughtto renounce the powerful conservation ethicwe developed during the Great Depression and World War II.After the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacitytoward creation of products for peacetime.Life Magazine helped in this effortby announcing the introduction of throwawaysthat would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.Mental note to the liberators:throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest.Plastics are also hard to recycle.A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percentof plastics recovered in our waste stream.It's diddly-point-squat.That's the percentage we recycle.Now, melting point has a lot to do with this.Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal.It begins to melt below the boiling point of waterand does not drive off the oily contaminantsfor which it is a sponge.Half of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pelletswill be made into fast-track trash.A large, unruly fraction of our trashwill flow downriver to the sea.Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport.And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beachand the diesel plant we visited yesterday.In spite of deposit fees,much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles.We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes,here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan,who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail.Here is a remote island repository for bottlesoff the coast of Baja California.Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookeryoff Baja's sparsely populated central coast.Notice that the bottles here have caps on them.Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, PET,will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization.Also, the caps are produced in separate factoriesfrom a different plastic, polypropylene.They will float in seawater,but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills.Let's trace the journey of the millions of capsthat make it to sea solo.After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific,while ours get caught in the California currentand first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas.After ten years, a lot of the Japanese capsare in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch,while ours litter the Philippines.After 20 years, we see emerging the debris accumulation zoneof the North Pacific Gyre.It so happens that millions of albatrossnesting on Kure and Midway atollsin the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monumentforage here and scavenge whatever they can findfor regurgitation to their chicks.A four-month old Laysan Albatross chickdied with this in its stomach.Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dyingwith stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish,like cigarette lighters ...but, mostly bottle caps.Sadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for foodtossing about in the ocean surface.The retainer rings for the capsalso have consequences for aquatic animals.This is Mae West,still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans.I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem,so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005I went to the Long Beach Peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown.I offered five cents each for bottle caps.I got plenty of takers.Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected.I thought I would spend 20 bucks.That day I ended up spending nearly 60.I separated them by colorand put them on display the next Earth Dayat Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display.In spite of my "girly man" hat, crocheted from plastic shopping bags,they shook my hand. (Laughter)I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawlfrom the gyre north of Hawaiiwith more plastic than plankton.Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like.Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mileproduces samples like this.And this.Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaiiit looks like this.And this particular beach is Kailua Beach,the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington.Now, how do we analyze samples like this onethat contain more plastic than plankton?We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes,from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutantsup to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater.We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean,at the base of the food chain,was ingesting these poison pills.We did hundreds of necropsies,and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs.The record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long,had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach.Now, you can buy certified organic produce.But no fishmonger on Earthcan sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.The throwaway society cannot be contained --it has gone global.We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.We have to throw it away.Now, the market can do a lot for us,but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken.All the king's horses and all the king's men ...will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again.Narrator (Video): The levels are increasing,the amount of packaging is increasing,the "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating,and it's showing up in the ocean.Anchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.Straining the ocean for plasticwould be beyond the budget of any countryand it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source:stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world,he doesn't hold out much hope for that, either.This is Brian Rooney for Nightline,in Long Beach, California.Charles Moore: Thank you.

I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakersthat worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.So I want to show you a clip of the film now.Hopefully it won't stutter.And if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved.Voice (Video): I don't know how it's possible ...but you seem to have more hair.Brad Pitt: What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ...but I was getting younger than everybody else?I was born with some form of disease.Voice: What kind of disease?BP: I was born old.Man: I'm sorry.BP: No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age.Girl: Are you sick?BP: I heard momma and Tizzy whisper,and they said I was gonna die soon.But ... maybe not.Girl: You're different than anybody I've ever met.BB: There were many changes ...some you could see, some you couldn't.Hair started growing in all sorts of places,along with other things.I felt pretty good, considering.Ed Ulbrich: That was a clip from "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."Many of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story,but what you might not knowis that for nearly the first hour of the film,the main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt,is completely computer-generated from the neck up.Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeupor photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body.We've created a completely digital human head.So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.Now, this movie has floated around Hollywoodfor well over half a century,and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s,with Ron Howard as the director.We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.But at the time we had to throw in the towel.It was deemed impossible.It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.The human form, in particular the human head,has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry.The project came back to us about a decade later,and this time with a director named David Fincher.Now, Fincher is an interesting guy.David is fearless of technology,and he is absolutely tenacious.And David won't take "no."And David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry,that anything is possibleas long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money.And so David had an interesting take on the film,and he threw a challenge at us.He wanted the main character of the film to be playedfrom the cradle to the grave by one actor.It happened to be this guy.We went through a process of elimination and a process of discoverywith David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors.That was one idea: that we would have different actors,and we would hand off from actor to actor.We even ruled out the idea of using makeup.We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up,particularly in close-up.And makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up.And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's faceto bring the aging to this character.He needed to be a very sympathetic character.So we decided to cast a series of little peoplethat would play the different bodies of Benjaminat the different increments of his lifeand that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head,aged to appear as Benjamin,and attach that to the body of the real actor.Sounded great.Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry,and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either,because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store,you know -- we see his face constantly.So there really was no tolerable margin of error.There were two studios involved: Warner Brothers and Paramount.And they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course,but it was a very high-risk proposition.There was lots of money and reputations at stake.But we believed that we had a very solid methodologythat might work ...But despite our verbal assurances,they wanted some proof.And so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin.And we did it in about five weeks.But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.We basically put something together to get through the meeting.I'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button.And in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head --pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor.And it worked. And it gave the studio great relief.After many years of starts and stops on this project,and making that tough decision,they finally decided to greenlight the movie.And I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us,to say the movie was a go,I actually threw up.(Laughter)You know, this is some tough stuff.So we started to have early team meetings,and we got everybody together,and it was really more like therapy in the beginning,convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this.We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.And of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem. (Laughter)So we had a big problem:we didn't know how we were going to do this.But we did know one thing.Being from the visual effects industry,we, with David, believed that we now had enough time,enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money.And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.So, when you're faced with something like that,of course you've got to break it down.You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller piecesand you start to attack that.So we had three main areas that we had to focus on.We needed to make Brad look a lot older --needed to age him 45 years or so.And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies,his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he isand have that translate through our processso that it appears in Benjamin on the screen.And we also needed to create a characterthat could hold up under, really, all conditions.He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight,at nighttime, under candlelight,he had to hold an extreme close-up,he had to deliver dialogue,he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat,he had to be able to take a bath, to cry,he even had to throw up.Not all at the same time --but he had to, you know, do all of those things.And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.We did about 325 shots.So we needed a system that would allow Benjaminto do everything a human being can do.And we realized that there was a giant chasmbetween the state of the art of technology in 2004and where we needed it to be.So we focused on motion capture.I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture.The state of the art at the timewas something called marker-based motion capture.I'll give you an example here.It's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard,and they put some reflective markers on your body,and instead of using cameras,there're infrared sensors around a volume,and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional positionof those markers in real time.And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markersand apply them to a computer-generated character.You can see the computer characters on the rightare having the same complex motion as the dancers.But we also looked at numbers of other films at the timethat were using facial marker tracking,and that's the idea of putting markers on the human faceand doing the same process.And as you can see, it gives you a pretty crappy performance.That's not terribly compelling.And what we realizedwas that what we neededwas the information that was going on between the markers.We needed the subtleties of the skin.We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things.Our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away fromthe technology of the day, the status quo, the state of the art.So we aborted using motion capture.And we were now well out of our comfort zone,and in uncharted territory.So we were left with this ideathat we ended up calling "technology stew."We started to look out in other fields.The idea was that we were going to findnuggets or gems of technologythat come from other industries like medical imaging,the video game space,and re-appropriate them.And we had to create kind of a sauce.And the sauce was code in softwarethat we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technologyto come together and work as one.Initially, we came across some remarkable researchdone by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s.He believed that he could, in fact,catalog the human face.And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS.He believed that there were 70 basic posesor shapes of the human face,and that those basic poses or shapes of the facecan be combined to create infinite possibilitiesof everything the human face is capable of doing.And of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender.So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward.And then we came across some remarkable technologycalled Contour.And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeupstippled on her face.And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface captureas opposed to a marker capture.The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras,and those cameras can, frame-by-frame,reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment.So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject.And if you look in a comparison,on the left, we see what volumetric data gives usand on the right you see what markers give us.So, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this.But these were the early days of this technology,and it wasn't really proven yet.We measure complexity and fidelity of datain terms of polygonal count.And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons.We could go up into the millions of polygons.It seemed to be infinite.This was when we had our "Aha!"This was the breakthrough.This is when we're like, "OK, we're going to be OK,This is actually going to work."And the "Aha!" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt,and we could put Brad in this device,and use this Contour process,and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeupand put him under the black lights,and we could, in fact, scan him in real timeperforming Ekman's FACS poses.Right? So, effectively,we ended up with a 3D databaseof everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing.(Laughter)From there, we actually carved up those facesinto smaller pieces and components of his face.So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes,a complete database of all possibilitiesthat his face is capable of doing.Now, that's great, except we had him at age 44.We need to put another 40 years on him at this point.We brought in Rick Baker,and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurusof our industry.And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji,and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time.And we commissioned them to make a maquette,or a bust, of Benjamin.So, in the spirit of "The Great Unveiling" -- I had to do this --I had to unveil something.So this is Ben 80.We created three of these:there's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60.And this really became the template for moving forward.Now, this was made from a life cast of Brad.So, in fact, anatomically, it is correct.The eyes, the jaw, the teeth:everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has.We have these maquettes scanned into the computerat very high resolution --enormous polygonal count.And so now we had three age increments of Benjaminin the computer.But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.We went through this process, then, called retargeting.This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.And here's the resulting data that comes from that,the model that comes from that.Retargeting is the process of transposing that dataonto another model.And because the life cast, or the bust -- the maquette -- of Benjaminwas made from Brad,we could transpose the data of Brad at 44onto Brad at 87.So now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can doat age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s.Next we had to go into the shooting process.So while all that's going on,we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world.And we shot our body actors,and we shot them wearing blue hoods.So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.And the blue hoods helped us with two things:one, we could easily erase their heads;and we also put tracking markers on their headsso we could recreate the camera motionand the lens optics from the set.But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.And so we edited the footage that was shot on locationwith the rest of the cast and the body actorsand about six months laterwe brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angelesand he watched on the screen.His job, then, was to become Benjamin.And so we looped the scenes.He watched again and again.We encouraged him to improvise.And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual placesthat we didn't think he was going to go.We shot him with four HD camerasso we'd get multiple views of himand then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjaminthat he thought best matched the footagewith the rest of the cast.From there we went into a process called image analysis.And so here, you can see again, the chosen take.And you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87.And so, what's interesting about this iswe used something called image analysis,which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face.And so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow.And the software would tell us that, well,in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here,and it concludes moving in frame 32.And so we could choose numbers of positions on the faceto pull that data from.And then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew --that secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us tomatch the performance footage of Bradin live action with our database of aged Benjamin,the FACS shapes that we had.On a frame-by-frame basis,we could actually reconstruct a 3D headthat exactly matched the performance of Brad.So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.And here you can see the body actor.And then this is what we called the "dead head," no reference to Jerry Garcia.And then here's the reconstructed performancenow with the timings of the performance.And then, again, the final shot.It was a long process.(Applause)The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this,because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides.We had to create a lighting system.So really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environmentfor every single location that Benjamin had to appearso that we could put Ben's head into any sceneand it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actorsin the real world.We also had to create an eye system.We found the old adage, you know,"The eyes are the window to the soul,"absolutely true.So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity,and feel his intent coming through the eyes,then we would succeed.So we had one person focused on the eye systemfor almost two full years.We also had to create a mouth system.We worked from dental molds of Brad.We had to age the teeth over time.We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.He was very popular.Skin displacement: another big deal.The skin had to be absolutely accurate.He's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing homearound other old people,so he had to look exactly the same as the others.So, lots of work on skin deformation,you can see in some of these cases it works,in some cases it looks bad.This is a very, very, very early test in our process.So, effectively we created a digital puppetthat Brad Pitt could operate with his own face.There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavioror enhance his performance.There was something that we encountered, though,that we ended up calling "the digital Botox effect."So, as things went through this process,Fincher would always say, "It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."And thing our process and the technology couldn't do,is they couldn't understand intent,the intent of the actor.So it sees a smile as a smile.It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile,or a frustrated smile.So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.But we ended up calling the entire processand all the technology "emotion capture,"as opposed to just motion capture.Take another look.Brad Pitt: Well, I heard momma and Tizzy whisper,and they said I was gonna die soon,but ... maybe not.EU: That's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes.(Applause)A couple of quick factoids;it really took 155 people over two years,and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut.But, that is Benjamin. Thank you.

There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.So let's start talking about that.I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.That's what I have behind myself.(Laughter)But of course what we have to remember is this.And what you have to think about is,when you're dancing in the flames, what's next?So what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutesis I'm going to talk first about the flames --where we are in the economy --and then I'm going to take three trendsthat have taken place at TED over the last 25 yearsand that will take place in this conferenceand I will try and bring them together.And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.Those three trends arethe ability to engineer cells,the ability to engineer tissues,and robots.And somehow it will all make sense.But anyway, let's start with the economy.There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.One is leverage.And the problem with leverage isit makes the U.S. financial system look like this.(Laughter)So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,it's an investment bank;it has 15 to 20 times.It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.Oops.That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.And that, of course, is the reason why all of youare making such generous and wonderful donationsto these nice folks.And as you think about that,you've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?(Laughter)It ain't pretty.The government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.We all love Santa Claus, right?But the problem with Santa Clause is,if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doingand promising folks,it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spendingon what we call "entitlements."And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.And we weren't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,that we've brought that date of reckoning forwardto about 2017.And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,but, guess what?We're going to start to pay them.And the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill's come due,it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime.Right?(Laughter)Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.And he gave an interview in December.Here's his first bit of advice.And here's his second bit of advice.And, by the way,the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.This stuff is getting serious enoughthat if we don't start paying attention to the deficit,we're going to end up losing the dollar.And then all bets are off.Let me show you what it looks like.I think I can safely saythat I'm the only trillionaire in this room.This is an actual bill.And it's 10 triliion dollars.The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much.That was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,a buck next week.And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them.So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want --you've just got to say no.And you've got to start banishing a word that's called "entitlement."And the reason we have to do that in the short termis because we have just run out of cash.If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.The orange slice is what's discretionary.Everything else is mandated.It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.So what we have to start thinking about doingis capping our medical spendingbecause that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.We've got to start thinking about asking peopleto retire a little bit later.If you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.Your 401(k) just got nailed.If you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.If you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.The reason why that's reasonable is,when your grandparents were given Social Security,they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.Sixty-eight is young today.We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year.We've got to limit other mandatory spending.We've got to quit borrowing as much,because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.And we've got to end up with a smaller government.And if we don't start changing this trend line,we are going to lose the dollarand start to look like Iceland.I got what you're thinking.This is going to happen when hell freezes over.But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas.(Laughter)Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff.So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisisback in the late '80s.And its 225 largest companies todayare worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.We don't fix this now,how would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.And unless you want this personto not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States,we'd better deal with this stuff.That's the short term. That's the flame part.That's the financial crisis.Now, right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wavethat we need to talk about.That wave is much larger, much more powerful,and that's of course the wave of technology.And what's really important in this stuff is,as we cut, we also have to grow.Among other things, because startup companiesare .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentmand they're about 17.8 percent of output.It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.And that's what we've got to keep growing.We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.And that's where these three trends come together.That's where the ability to engineer microbes,the ability to engineer tissues,and the ability to engineer robotsbegin to lead to a reboot.And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen.Craig Venter showed up last yearand showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardwarewhere you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.In parallel, the folks at MIThave been building a standard registry of biological parts.So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.You can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.And start building stuff.In 2006 they brought together high school students and college studentsand started to build these little odd creatures.They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.Here was one of the first things they built.So, cells have this cycle.First they don't grow.Then they grow exponentially.Then they stop growing.Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.So they engineered these cellsso that when they're growing in the exponential phase,they would smell like wintergreen.And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.And you could tell very easily when your experiment was workingand wasn't, and where it was in the phase.This got a bit more complicated two years later.Twenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.They started competing.The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red winethat makes red wine good for youinto beer.So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.Of course, one of the judges is wandering by, and he goes,"Wow! Cancer-fighting beer! There is a God."(Laughter)The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.They tried to engineer bacterias in such a waythat they would act as your kidneys.Four years ago, I showed you this picture.And people oohed and ahhed,because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken.And that was very cool stuff back then.But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering,let me show you what's happened in that period of time.Two years ago, you saw this creature.An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexicocalled an axolotlthat can re-generate its limbs.You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.You can freeze half the brain. It regrows.It's almost like leaving Congress.(Laughter)But now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate,because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.And, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes,you can grow human molars in Petri dishes.This should not surprise you, right?I mean, you're born with no teeth.You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.You re-grow a set of teeth.But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth, they don't regrow,unless, if you're a lawyer.(Laughter)But, of course, for most of us,we know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth,put them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth,and simply implant it.And we can do it with other things.So, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea,they took all the cells off the trachea,they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.She regrew her own trachea,and 72 hours later it was implanted.She's now running around with her kids.This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forestwhere he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers,and he's also re-growing bladders.So there are now nine women walking around Bostonwith re-grown bladders,which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bagsfor the rest of your life.This is kind of getting boring, right?I mean, you understand where this story's going.But, I mean it gets more interesting.Last year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart,leaving just the cartilage.Then, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.Those stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.Life happens.This may be one of the ultimate papers.This was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time,and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.That meant that you can take the stuff right here,and turn it into almost anything in your body.And this is becoming common, it's moving very quickly,it's moving in a whole series of places.Third trend: robots.Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by nowwe would have Rosie the Robot from "The Jetsons" in our house.And all we've got is a Roomba.(Laughter)We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger.Didn't happen.And these were robots engineered for a flat world, right?So, Rosie runs around on skatesand the other one ran on flat threads.If you don't have a flat world, that's not good,which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different.This is Boston Dynamics' "BigDog."And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.O.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you've got a wall,you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall,and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal --that's when computers have reached human intelligence.This is not an intelligence Turing rest,but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.And this stuff is moving very quickly,and by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.These are not the only interesting robots.You've also got flies, the size of flies,that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford.And as you bring these things together,as you bring cells, biological tissue engineering and mechanics together,you begin to get some really odd questions.In the last Olympics, this gentleman,who had several world records in the Special Olympics,tried to run in the normal Olympics.The only issue with Oscar Pistoriusis he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs.He came within about a second of qualifying.He sued to be allowed to run,and he won the suit,but didn't qualify by time.Next Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors,is going to make the time.And two or three Olympics after that, they are going to be unbeatable.And as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it meansto take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear --I mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right?I mean, your grandparents had these great big cones,and then your parents had these odd boxesthat would squawk at odd times during dinner,and now we have these little buds that nobody sees.And now you have cochlear implantsthat go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear.Now, they can't hear as well as you and I can.But, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will,and these are machine generations, not human generations.And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can,they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk,or how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales.They'll be able to focus their hearing,they'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity,do a series of things that we can't do.And the same thing is happening in eyes.This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyesso that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark.Very primitive.And then they'll be able to see shape.And then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition,and one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.And a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet,they'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes,they'll be able to come into a microfocus.They'll do stuff you and I can't do.All of these things are coming together,and it's a particularly important thing to understand,as we worry about the flames of the present,to keep an eye on the future.And, of course, the future is looking back 200 years,because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.And it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species."And Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.It is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.There have actually been 22 species of hominidsthat have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,have gone extinct.It is common for hominids to evolve.And that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,and Homo sapiens, all overlap.The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids,not one.And as you think of the implications of that,here's a brief history of the universe.The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,and then you created all the stars, and all the planets,and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,and then you got life about four billion years ago,and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.Ta-dah!Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,and all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,and all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuffis to create what's in this room.Maybe not.That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.(Laughter)So, if that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?(Laughter)I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.And I think this isn't 1,000 years out.I think most of us are going to glance at it,and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trendsinto a hominid that takes direct and deliberate controlover the evolution of his species, her species and other species.And that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot.Thank you very much.(Applause)

In his inaugural address,Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our bestas we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.But what did he appeal to?He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,and tell us to just go shopping.Nor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.Invest, invest, invest."Instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.And he appealed to virtue.Virtue is an old-fashioned word.It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.And besides, some of you might be wondering,what the hell does it mean?Let me begin with an example.This is the job description of a hospital janitorthat is scrolling up on the screen.And all of the items on it are unremarkable.They're the things you would expect:mop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.It may be a little surprising how many things there are,but it's not surprising what they are.But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this:even though this is a very long list,there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.Not one.The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.And yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitorsto get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like,they encountered Mike,who told them about how he stopped mopping the floorbecause Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise,trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonitionand didn't vacuum the visitor's loungebecause there were some family members who were there all day, every daywho, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.And then there was Luke,who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twicebecause the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months,didn't see Luke do it the first time,and his father was angry.And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nursesand, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors,doesn't just make people feel a little better,it actually improves the quality of patient careand enables hospitals to run well.Now, not all janitors are like this, of course.But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactionsinvolving kindness, care and empathyare an essential part of the job.And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means."Practical wisdom," Aristotle told us,"is the combination of moral will and moral skill."A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule,as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.A wise person knows how to improvise,as Luke did when he re-washed the floor.Real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-definedand the context is always changing.A wise person is like a jazz musician --using the notes on the page, but dancing around them,inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.A wise person knows how to use these moral skillsin the service of the right aims.To serve other people, not to manipulate other people.And finally, perhaps most important,a wise person is made, not born.Wisdom depends on experience,and not just any experience.You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.You need permission to be allowed to improvise,try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.And you need to be mentored by wise teachers.When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I describedhow hard it is to learn to do their job,they tell you that it takes lots of experience.And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.At TED, brilliance is rampant.It's scary.The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.The bad news is that without wisdom,brilliance isn't enough.It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.(Applause)Now, I hope that we all know this.There's a sense in which it's obvious,and yet, let me tell you a little story.It's a story about lemonade.A dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.His son asked him for some lemonadeand Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade,which was five percent alcohol.Dad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.So he brought it back.And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it,and called the police, who called an ambulancethat rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.And they were ready to let the kid go.But not so fast.The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.And the child was sent to a foster home for three days.At that point, can the child go home?Well, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.After two weeks, I'm happy to report,the family was reunited.But the welfare workers and the ambulance peopleand the judge all said the same thing:"We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."How do things like this happen?Scott Simon, who told this story on NPR,said, "Rules and procedures may be dumb,but they spare you from thinking."And, to be fair, rules are often imposedbecause previous officials have been laxand they let a child go back to an abusive household.Fair enough.When things go wrong, as of course they do,we reach for two tools to try to fix them.One tool we reach for is rules.Better ones, more of them.The second tool we reach for is incentives.Better ones, more of them.What else, after all, is there?We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.Regulate, regulate, regulate.Fix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...The truth is that neither rules nor incentivesare enough to do the job.How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?It's preposterous on its face.And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules,rules and incentives may make things better in the short run,but they create a downward spiralthat makes them worse in the long run.Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rulesthat deprives us of the opportunityto improvise and learn from our improvisations.And moral will is underminedby an incessant appeal to incentivesthat destroy our desire to do the right thing.And without intending it,by appealing to rules and incentives,we are engaging in a war on wisdom.Let me just give you a few examples,first of rules and the war on moral skill.The lemonade story is one.Second, no doubt more familiar to you,is the nature of modern American education:scripted, lock-step curricula.Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten.Reading and enjoying literatureand words that begin with 'B.'"The Bath:" Assemble students on a rugand give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city,every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.We know why these scripts are there.We don't trust the judgment of teachers enoughto let them loose on their own.Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.And they prevent disaster.But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.(Applause)Don't get me wrong. We need rules!Jazz musicians need some notes --most of them need some notes on the page.We need more rules for the bankers, God knows.But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musiciansfrom improvising.And as a result, they lose their gifts,or worse, they stop playing altogether.Now, how about incentives?They seem cleverer.If you have one reason for doing somethingand I give you a second reason for doing the same thing,it seems only logical that two reasons are better than oneand you're more likely to do it.Right?Well, not always.Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one anotherinstead of complimenting,and they make people less likely to do it.I'll just give you one example because time is racing.In Switzerland, back about 15 years ago,they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.There was going to be a national referendum.Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.And they said, "Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"Astonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.They knew it was dangerous.They thought it would reduce their property values.But it had to go somewhereand they had responsibilities as citizens.The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.They said, "If we paid you six weeks' salary every yearwould you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"Two reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid.Instead of 50 percent saying yes,25 percent said yes.What happens is thatthe second this introduction of incentive gets usso that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?"all we ask is, "What serves my interests?"When incentives don't work,when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companiesin pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses,the response is always the same.Get smarter incentives.The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devisethat are ever going to be smart enough.Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will.We need incentives. People have to make a living.But excessive reliance on incentivesdemoralizes professional activityin two senses of that word.It causes people who engage in that activity to lose moraleand it causes the activity itself to lose morality.Barack Obama said, before he was inaugurated,"We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but 'Is it right?'"And when professions are demoralized,everyone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentivesand they stop asking "Is it right?"We see this in medicine.("Although it's nothing serious, let's keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't turn into a major lawsuit.")And we certainly see it in the world of business.("In order to remain competitive in today's marketplace, I'm afraid we're going to have to replace you with a sleezeball.")("I sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now.")It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work.So what can we do?A few sources of hope:we ought to try to re-moralize work.One way not to do it: teach more ethics courses.(Applause)There is no better way to show people that you're not seriousthan to tie up everything you have to say about ethicsinto a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course.What to do instead?One: Celebrate moral exemplars.Acknowledge, when you go to law school,that a little voice is whispering in your earabout Atticus Finch.No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions.People are inspired by moral heroes.But we learn that with sophisticationcomes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.Well, acknowledge them.Be proud that you have them.Celebrate them.And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.That's one thing we can do.I don't know how many of you remember this:another moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein,who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts --they made Polartec --The factory burned down.3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.Why? Because it would have been a disaster for themand for the community if he had let them go."Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street,but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine."Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes.Two were particularly inspiring to me.One was Ray Anderson, who turned --(Applause)-- turned, you know, a part of the evil empireinto a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.Why? Because it was the right thing to do.And a bonus he's discovering ishe's actually going to make even more money.His employees are inspired by the effort.Why? Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.(Applause)In many ways this is the perfect example.Because it took the will to do the right thing.God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to knowin order to plot this out.But most important to make it work --and he emphasized this --is that it took knowing the people in the communities.Unless the people you're working with are behind you,this will fail.And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you,because different people in different communitiesorganize their lives in different ways.So there's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.And you don't have to be a mega-hero.There are ordinary heroes.Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.As practitioners each and every one of us should striveto be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.As heads of organizations,we should strive to create environmentsthat encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.Even the wisest and most well-meaning peoplewill give up if they have to swim against the currentin the organizations in which they work.If you run an organization, you should be surethat none of the jobs -- none of the jobs --have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.Because the truth is thatany work that you do that involves interaction with other peopleis moral work.And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom.And, perhaps most important,as teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes,the moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.One is that we are always teaching.Someone is always watching.The camera is always on.Bill Gates talked about the importance of educationand, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing:"Knowledge is power."And he talked about a lot of the wonderful thingsthat KIPP is doingto take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doingthat Bill didn't mention.That is that they have come to the realizationthat the single most important thing kids need to learnis character.They need to learn to respect themselves.They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.They need to learn to respect their teachers.And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.That's the principle objective.If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.And the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kidsis by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day.Obama appealed to virtue.And I think he was right.And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom,because it's what allows other virtues -- honesty, kindness, courage and so on --to be displayed at the right time and in the right way.He also appealed to hope.Right again.I think there is reason for hope.I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.In many ways, it's what TED is all about.Wanting to do the right thingin the right wayfor the right reasons.This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of usif only we start paying attention.Paying attention to what we do,to how we do it,and, perhaps most importantly,to the structure of the organizations within which we work,so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdomrather than having it suppressed.Thank you very much.Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: You have to go and stand out here a sec.Barry Schwartz: Thank you very much.(Applause)



david_merrill_demos_siftables_the_smart_blocks

I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid,playing with blocks.As you figured out how to reach out and grasp,pick them up and move them around,you were actually learning how to think and solve problemsby understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.Spatial reasoning is deeply connectedto how we understand a lot of the world around us.So, as a computer scientistinspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects --along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi --I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer,instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertipmoving around a flat desktop,what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically,arranging it the way we wanted?This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer,by building Siftables.In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computerthe size of a cookie.They're able to be moved around by hand,they can sense each other, they can sense their motion,and they have a screen and a wireless radio.Most importantly, they're physical,so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystemof tools for manipulating digital information.And as these tools become more physical,more aware of their motion, aware of each other,and aware of the nuance of how we move them,we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.This Siftable is configured to show video,and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way;if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.If they get surrounded, they notice that too,they might get a little flustered.And they can also sense their motion and tilt.One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize,was that we could use everyday gestures on data,like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint bucketsand I can use them to pour color into that central one,where they get mixed.If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.There are also some neat possibilities for education,like language, math and logic gameswhere we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,and view the results immediately.So here I'm --(Applause)This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.Basically, in every roundyou get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab,and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.They really loved it.And, one of the interesting things about this kind of applicationis that you don't have to give people many instructions.All you have to say is, "Make words,"and they know exactly what to do.So here's another few people trying it out.That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.So to him, they were just blocks.Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.And this is Felix, actually.And he can bring new characters into the scene,just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.Here, he's bringing the sun out.Video: The sun is rising.David Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.Video: The orange tractor.Good job! Yeah!DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each otherhe can make the characters interact --Video: Woof!DM: inventing his own narrative.Video: Hello!DM: It's an open-ended story,and he gets to decide how it unfolds.Video: Fly away, cat.DM: So, the last example I have time to show you todayis a music sequencing and live performance toolthat we've built recently,in which Siftables act as soundslike lead, bass and drums.Each of these has four different variations,you get to choose which one you want to use.And you can inject these sounds into a sequencethat you can assemble into the pattern that you want.And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.And then, overall effects like tempo and volumethat apply to the entire sequence.So let's have a look.Video: (Music)DM: We'll start by putting a leadinto two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series,extend it, add a little more lead.Now I put a bass line in.Video: (Music)DM: Now I'll put some percussion in.Video: (Music)DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live.Video: (Music)DM: I can speed up the whole sequenceby tilting the tempo one way or the other.Video: (Music)DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.Video: (Music)DM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise,making it longer or shorter as I go.And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence outusing the volume Siftable, tilted to the left.(Applause)Thank you.So, as you can see,my passion is for making new human-computer interfacesthat are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space,and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.So the thought I want to leave you withis that we're on the cusp of this new generation of toolsfor interacting with digital mediathat are going to bring information into our worldon our terms.Thank you very much.I look forward to talking with all of you.(Applause)

I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,sharing some of the problems.And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that --being honest about what was going well, what wasn't,and making it kind of an annual thing.A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,because I think there are some very important problemsthat don't get worked on naturally.That is, the market does not drive the scientists,the communicators, the thinkers, the governmentsto do the right things.And only by paying attention to these thingsand having brilliant people who care and draw other people incan we make as much progress as we need to.So this morning I'm going to share two of these problemsand talk about where they stand.But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.Another statistic, perhaps my favorite,is to look at childhood deaths.As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,and 20 million of those died before the age of five.Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more --and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.It's a phenomenal thing.Each one of those lives matters a lot.And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomesbut also a few key breakthroughs:vaccines that were used more widely.For example, measles was four million of the deathsback as recently as 1990and now is under 400,000.So we really can make changes.The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.Why? Well there's only a few diseasesthat account for the vast majority of those deaths:diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning,which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?Well, what's the history of this disease?It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.In fact, if we look at the genetic code,it's the only disease we can seethat people who lived in Africaactually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.So it was absolutely gigantic.And the disease was all over the world.A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.So it was everywhere.And two tools helped bring the death rate down.One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.And so that's why the death rate did come down.Now, ironically, what happened wasit was eliminated from all the temperate zones,which is where the rich countries are.So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.1945, it's still most places.1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.And so this leads to the paradox thatbecause the disease is only in the poorer countries,it doesn't get much investment.For example, there's more money put into baldness drugsthan are put into malaria.Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.(Laughter)And rich men are afflicted.And so that's why that priority has been set.But, malaria --even the million deaths a year caused by malariagreatly understate its impact.Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.It means that you can't get the economies in these areas goingbecause it just holds things back so much.Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.I brought some here, just so you could experience this.We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.(Laughter)There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.(Laughter) (Applause)Those mosquitos are not infected.So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.And bed nets are a great tool.What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.And when you use indoor spraying with DDTand those netsyou can cut deaths by over 50 percent.And that's happened now in a number of countries.It's great to see.But we have to be careful because malaria --the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.And so you end up with two choices.If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,you do it vigorously,you can actually get a local eradication.And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.Or, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,but eventually those tools will become ineffective,and the death rate will soar back up again.And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.Now we're on the upswing.Bed net funding is up.There's new drug discovery going on.Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trialthat starts in a couple months.And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.So we're going to have these new tools.But that alone doesn't give us the road map.Because the road map to get rid of this diseaseinvolves many things.It involves communicators to keep the funding high,to keep the visibility high,to tell the success stories.It involves social scientists,so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,but 90 percent.We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.And so as these elements come together,I'm quite optimisticthat we will be able to eradicate malaria.Now let me turn to a second question,a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.And this is: How do you make a teacher great?It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,and we'd understand very well.And the answer is, really, that we don't.Let's start with why this is important.Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.We all had a wonderful education.That's part of the reason we're here today,part of the reason we're successful.I can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.I had great teachers.In fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,if you measure them against the other top 20 percent.And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnologyand keep the U.S. at the forefront.Now, the strength for those top 20 percentis starting to fade on a relative basis,but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities nowto people with a better education.And we have to change this.We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.We have to change it so that the country is strongand stays at the forefrontof things that are driven by advanced education,like science and mathematics.When I first learned the statistics,I was pretty stunned at how bad things are.Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.And that had been covered up for a long timebecause they always took the dropout rate as the numberwho started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.But most of the dropouts had taken place before that.They had to raise the stated dropout rateas soon as that tracking was doneto over 30 percent.For minority kids, it's over 50 percent.And even if you graduate from high school,if you're low-income,you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.If you're low-income in the United States,you have a higher chance of going to jailthan you do of getting a four-year degree.And that doesn't seem entirely fair.So, how do you make education better?Now, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.There's many people working on it.We've worked on small schools,we've funded scholarships,we've done things in libraries.A lot of these things had a good effect.But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teacherswas the very key thing.And we hooked up with some people studyinghow much variation is there between teachers,between, say, the top quartile -- the very best --and the bottom quartile.How much variation is there within a school or between schools?And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class --based on test scores --by over 10 percent in a single year.What does that mean?That means that if the entire U.S., for two years,had top quartile teachers,the entire difference between us and Asia would go away.Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.So, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.We should retain those people.We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.What are the characteristics of this top quartile?What do they look like?You might think these must be very senior teachers.And the answer is no.Once somebody has taught for three yearstheir teaching quality does not change thereafter.The variation is very, very small.You might think these are people with master's degrees.They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.This chart takes four different factorsand says how much do they explain teaching quality.That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,is a master's degree.Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.One is seniority.Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.Teach for America: slight effect.For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.There are some people who are very good at this.And we've done almost nothingto study what that isand to draw it in and to replicate it,to raise the average capability --or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.And it's a system with very high turnover.Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.It's an unbelievable thing.They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools --and what goes on is great teaching.They take the poorest kids,and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.And the whole spirit and attitude in those schoolsis very different than in the normal public schools.They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.They're taking data, the test scores,and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms,at first it's very bizarre.I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.What's going on?"And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention,which kids were bored,and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.It was a very dynamic environment,because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade --keeping people engaged and setting the tonethat everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.Everybody needs to be involved.And so KIPP is doing it.How does that compare to a normal school?Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.The data isn't gathered.In the teacher's contract,it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom --sometimes to once per year.And they need advanced notice to do that.So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers,some of them just making crapand the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,and try and do a good job in that one brief moment."Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.They don't have the test scores,and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.For example, New York passed a lawthat said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and usedin the tenure decision for the teachers.And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.But I'm optimistic about this,I think there are some clear things we can do.First of all, there's a lot more testing going on,and that's given us the picture of where we are.And that allows us to understand who's doing it well,and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.Of course, digital video is cheap now.Putting a few cameras in the classroomand saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basisis very practical in all public schools.And so every few weeks teachers could sit downand say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"And they could all sit and work together on those problems.You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.You can take those great courses and make them availableso that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.If you have a kid who's behind,you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,but you could make it so that DVDs were always available,and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.And so by thinking of this as a personnel system,we can do it much better.Now there's a book actually, about KIPP --the place that this is going on --that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."And I thought it was so fantastic.It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.(Applause)Now, we put a lot of money into education,and I really think that education is the most important thing to get rightfor the country to have as strong a future as it should have.In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting --the House version actually had money in it for these data systems,and it was taken out in the Senatebecause there are people who are threatened by these things.But I -- I'm optimistic.I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.I only had time to frame those two problems.There's a lot more problems like that --AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited,just at the very name of these things.And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.So it's going to take brilliant people like youto study these things, get other people involved --and you're helping to come up with solutions.And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.Thank you.(Applause)

I became an inventor by accident.I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true:I went in in 1956, came out in 1959,was working at the University of Washington,and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article,for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs --any of the cool stuff we've got now.And it was an arm that,instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record,went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm.And it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started,and I got really lucky after that.And without giving you too much of a tirade,I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today:my 44th invention. No, that's not true either.Golly, I'm just totally losing it.My 44th patent; about the 15th invention.I call this hypersonic sound.I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes,but I want to make an analogy before I doto this.I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say,That's really cool, but what's it good for?And I say, What is the light bulb good for?Sound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy.When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.Hasn't changed that much.Light came out of it in every direction.Before the light bulb was invented,people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it,focus it a little bit;put lenses in front of it,focus it a little bit better.Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasersthat were totally focused.Now, think about where the world would be todayif we had the light bulb,but you couldn't focus light;if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.You turn on the loudspeaker,and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets,the sound just kind of goes where it wants.Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone,it's pretty much every direction.A little bit of differential, but not much.If the light bulb was the way the speaker is,and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it,we wouldn't have that, or movies in general,or computers, or T.V. sets,or C.D.s, or DVDs -- and just go down the listof what the importance isof being able to focus light.Now, after almost 80 years of having sound,I thought it was about time that we figure outa way to put sound where you want to.I have a couple of units.That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the dayfor a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car --small version, over your head --so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.What if I could aim sound the way I aim light?I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard.Now, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you.Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room.(Applause)The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool?(Applause)Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second,and tell you about how it works and what it's good for.Course, like light, it's great to be able to put soundto highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste,or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby.Sony's got an idea -- Sony's our biggest customers right now.They tried this back in the '60sand were too smart, and so they gave up.But they want to use it -- seriously.There's a mix an inventor has to have.You have to be kind of smart,and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid,because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today.Too many other smart people out there. So.I just happened to get my education in a little different way.I'm not at all against education.I think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people,when they get educated, lose it:they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than.And we're living in a great time right now,because almost everything's being explored anew.I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is:virtually nothing --and I mean this honestly --has been invented yet.We're just starting.We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics.And this is, I hope, a little piece of it.Sony's got this vision back -- to get myself on track --that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket,you're going to watch a new T.V. channel.They know that when you watch T.V. at home,because there are so many choicesyou can change channels, miss their commercials.A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket.Now, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed,because the checker gets tired of hearing the same messageevery 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie,you get to watch it for free;when you want to hear the sound, you pay.And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thingwhere when you step in the line in the supermarket --initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways;they're trying this in three parts of the country right now --you'll be watching TV.And hopefully they'll be sensitivethat they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet.But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is,if you don't want to hear it,you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it.So, we create silence as much as we create sound.ATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it.Sit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV;your spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep;doesn't hear it, doesn't wake up.We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.I have been really lucky with this technology:all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.They have literally beat a path to our door.We've been selling it since about last September, October,and it's been immensely gratifying.If you're interested in what it costs -- I'm not selling them today --but this unit, with the electronics and everything,if you buy one, is around a thousand bucks.We expect by this time next year,it'll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it.It's not any more pricey than regular electronics.Now, when I played it for you, you didn't hear the thunderous bass.This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing.It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound --that's about 100,000 vibrations per second.And the sound that you're hearing,unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face,is made out in front of it, in the air.The air is not linear, as we've always been taught.You turn up the volume just a little bit --I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels --and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.Now, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical,I'm making a little sine wave here in the air.Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much,I'm having an effect on the pressure,which means during the making of that sine wave,the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.All of audio as we know itis an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear.Linearity means higher quality sound.Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite:it's 100 percent based on non-linearity.An effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound --the ultrasound in this case -- that's emitted,but it's so predictablethat you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.Now, the question is, where's the sound made?Instead of being made on the face of the cone,it's made at literally billions of little independent pointsalong this narrow column in the air,and so when I aim it towards you,what you hear is made right next to your ears.I said we can shorten the column,we can spread it out to cover the couch.I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker,the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound.When you listen to stereo on your home system,your both ears hear both speakers.Turn on the left speaker sometimeand notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.So, the stage is more restricted --the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.Because the sound is made in the air along this column,it does not follow the inverse square law,which says it drops off about two thirdsevery time you double the distance:6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters.That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony,and the guy in the front row gets the same levelas the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden.Isn't that terrific?So, we've been, as I say, very successful, very lucky,in having companies catch the vision of this,from cars -- car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids,and a separate system in the back --oh, no, the kids aren't driving today.(Laughter)I was seeing if you were listening.Actually, I haven't had breakfast yet.A stereo system in the front for mom and dad,and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids,and the parents don't want to be bothered with that,or their rap music or whatever.So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want tois really starting to catch on.It also works for transmitting and communicating data.It also works five times better underwater.We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq,where you can put fake troop movementsquarter of a mile away on a hillside.(Laughter)Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse.(Laughter)I'm serious. And they have these infrared devicesthat can look at their countenance,and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shiftfrom 100 yards away when they play this thing.And so, another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't.We make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels.Pain is 120.So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people,and there can be a public beach just off to the side,and they don't even know it's turned on.We sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars,and they're buying them as fast as we can make them.We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you,you're over there, and it's there.I have a bunch of other inventions.I invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears.Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day --I was working on a ground-penetrating radar project --and my physicist CEO came in and said, "We have a real problem.We're using very short wavelengths.We've got a problem with the antenna ringing.When you run very short wavelengths,like a tuning fork the antenna resonates,and there's more energy coming out of the antennathan there is the backscatter from the groundthat we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing."I says, "Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it?Turn it on; turn it off.That's a fluorescent tube refined."I just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash.I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified,when the patent issued, and told the people back there about it,and they laughed, and then I took them back a demo and they bought.(Laughter)Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone -- the little cell headphones?That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars.Big mistake: it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago.I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computerin my attic at my house,and one of the many designs which they have nowis still the same design I drew way back when.So, I've been really lucky as an inventor.I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet.And my dad died before he realized anybody in the familywould maybe, hopefully, make something out of themselves.You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place.I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.Let me give you, in the last minute,one more quick demo of this guy,for those of you that haven't heard it.Can never tell if it's on.If you haven't heard it, raise your hand.Getting it over there?Get the cameraman.Yeah, there you go.I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head; that's really cool.Thank you once again.Appreciate it very much.



joseph_pine_on_what_consumers_want

I'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going onin the very fabric of the modern economy.And to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning,because in the beginning were commodities.Commodities are things that you grow in the ground, raise on the ground or pull out of the ground:basically, animal, mineral, vegetable.And then you extract them out of the ground,and sell them on the open marketplace.Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economythat lasted for millennia.But then along came the industrial revolution,and then goods became the predominant economic offering,where we used commodities as a raw materialto be able to make or manufacture goods.So, we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy.Well, what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years,is that goods have become commoditized.Commoditized: where they're treated like a commodity,where people don't care who makes them.They just care about three things and three things only:price, price and price.Now, there's an antidote to commoditization,and that is customization.My first book was called "Mass Customization" --it came up a couple of times yesterday --and how I discovered this progression of economic valuewas realizing that customizing a goodautomatically turned it into a service,because it was done just for a particular person,because it wasn't inventoried,it was delivered on demand to that individual person.So, we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy.But over the past 10 or 20 years, what's happened is thatservices are being commoditized as well.Long-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price;fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing;and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods,but services as well.What that means is that it's timeto move to a new level of economic value.Time to go beyond the goods and the services,and use, in that same heuristic, what happens when you customize a service?What happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person --that's exactly what they need at this moment in time?Then you can't help but make them go "wow";you can't help but turn it into a memorable event --you can't help but turn it into an experience.So we're shifting to an experience economy,where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering.Now most places that I talk to,when I talk about experience, I talk about Disney --the world's premier experience-stager.I talk about theme restaurants, and experiential retail,and boutique hotels, and Las Vegas --the experience capital of the world.But here, when you think about experiences,think about Thomas Dolby and his group, playing music.Think about meaningful places.Think about drinking wine,about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now.Those are all experiences. Think about TED itself.The experience capital in the world of conferences.All of these are experiences.Now, over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe,and particularly in the Netherlands,and whenever I talk about the experience economy there,I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question,almost invariably.And the question isn't really so much a questionas an accusation.And the Dutch, when they usually put it,it always starts with the same two words.You know the words I mean?You Americans.They say, you Americans.You like your fantasy environments,your fake, your Disneyland experiences.They say, we Dutch, we like real,natural, authentic experiences.So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response,which is: I point out that first of all,you have to understand that there is no such thingas an inauthentic experience.Why? Because the experience happens inside of us.It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us.So, as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings,then every experience we have is authentic.Now, there may be more or less natural or artificialstimuli for the experience,but even that is a matter of degree, not kind.And there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience.Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods,there is a company that manufactured the carthat delivered you to the edge of the woods;there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you haveto protect yourself from the ground of the woods.There's a company that provides a cell phone service you havein case you get lost in the woods.Right? All of those are man-made,artificiality brought into the woods by you,and by the very nature of being there.And then I always finish offby talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question,particularly coming from the Dutch,is that the Netherlandsis every bit as manufactured as Disneyland.(Laughter)And the Dutch, they always go ...and they realize, I'm right!There isn't a square meter of ground in the entire countrythat hasn't been reclaimed from the sea,or otherwise moved, modified and manicuredto look as if it had always been there.It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows.(Laughter)But nonetheless, not just the Dutch,but everyone has this desire for the authentic.And authenticity is thereforebecoming the new consumer sensibility --the buying criteria by which consumersare choosing who are they going to buy from,and what they're going to buy.Becoming the basis of the economy.In fact, you can look at how each of these economies developed,that each one has their own business imperative,matched with a consumer sensibility.We're the agrarian economy, and we're supplying commodities.It's about supply and availability.Getting the commodities to market.With the industrial economy, it is about controlling costs --getting the costs down as low as possibleso we can offer them to the masses.With the service economy, it is aboutimproving quality.That has -- the whole quality movement has risenwith the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years.And now, with the experience economy,it's about rendering authenticity.Rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is "rendering."Right? Rendering, because you have to get your consumers --as business people --to percieve your offerings as authentic.Because there is a basic paradox:no one can have an inauthentic experience,but no business can supply one.Because all businesses are man-made objects; all business is involved with money;all business is a matter of using machinery,and all those things make something inauthentic.So, how do you render authenticity,is the question.Are you rendering authenticity?When you think about that, let me go back towhat Lionel Trilling, in his seminal book on authenticity,"Sincerity and Authenticity" -- came out in 1960 --points to as the seminal pointat which authenticity entered the lexicon,if you will.And that is, to no surprise, in Shakespeare,and in his play, Hamlet.And there is one part in this play, Hamlet,where the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet, Polonius,says something profoundly real.At the end of a laundry list of advicehe's giving to his son, Laertes,he says this:And this above all: to thine own self be true.And it doth follow, as night the day,that thou canst not then be false to any man.And those three verses are the core of authenticity.There are two dimensions to authenticity:one, being true to yourself, which is very self-directed.Two, is other-directed:being what you say you are to others.And I don't know about you, but whenever I encounter two dimensions,I immediately go, ahh, two-by-two!All right? Anybody else like that, no?Well, if you think about that, you do, in fact, geta two-by-two.Where, on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself.As businesses, are the economic offerings you are providing --are they true to themselves?And the other dimension is:are they what they say they are to others?If not, you have,"is not true to itself," and "is not what it says it is,"yielding a two-by-two matrix.And of course, if you are both true to yourself,and are what you say you are, then you're real real!(Laughter)The opposite, of course, is -- fake fake.All right, now, there is value for fake.There will always be companies around to supply the fake,because there will always be desire for the fake.Fact is, there's a general rule: if you don't like it, it's fake;if you do like it, it's faux.(Laughter)Now, the other two sides of the coin are:being a real fake --is what it says it is,but is not true to itself,or being a fake real:is true to itself, but not what it says it is.You can think about those two -- you know, both of thesebetter than being fake fake -- not quite as good as being real real.You can contrast them by thinking aboutUniversal City Walk versusDisney World, or Disneyland.Universal City Walk is a real fake --in fact, we got this very termfrom Ada Louise Huxtable's book, "The Unreal America."A wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as --you know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake,right, because you can see behind the facade, right?It is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio;it's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot.Right? You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles,well, here's a place where you are going to walk a lot,outside in this city.But is it really true to itself?Right? Is it really in the city?Is it --you can see behind all of it,and see what is going on in the facades of it.So she calls it a real fake.Disney World, on the other hand, is a fake real,or a fake reality.Right? It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom.(Laughter)But it is -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --(Laughter)-- sorry.We won't talk about Santa Claus then.(Laughter)But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself.Right? Just wonderfully true to itself.When you are there you are just immersedin this wonderful environment.So, it's a fake real.Now the easiest wayto fall down in this,and not be real real,right, the easiest way not to be true to yourselfis not to understand your heritage,and thereby repudiate that heritage.Right, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business.Knowing where your heritage is: what you have done in the past.And what you have done in the past limits what you can do,what you can get away with, essentially, in the future.So, you have to understand that past.Think about Disney again.Disney,10 or 15 years ago, right,the Disney -- the company that is probablybest-known for family values out there,Disney bought the ABC network.The ABC network, affectionately known in the tradeas the T&amp;A network, right --that's not too much jargon, is it?Right, the T&amp;A network. Then it bought Miramax,known for its NC-17 fare,and all of a sudden, families everywherecouldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney.It was no longer true to its heritage;no longer true to Walt Disney.That's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today,and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner.Because it is no longer true to itself.So, understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future.When it comes to being what you say you are, the easiest mistake that companies makeis that they advertisethings that they are not.That's when you're perceived as fake, as a phony company --advertizing things that you're not.Think about any hotel, any airline,any hospital.Right, if you could check into the ads, you'd have a great experience.(Laughter)But unfortunately, you have to experience the actual hotel,airline and hospital, and then you have that disconnect.Then you have that perception that you are phony.So, the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are,is to provide places for people to experiencewho you are.For people to experience who you are.Right, it's not advertising does it.That's why you have companies like Starbucks,right, that doesn't advertise at all.They said, you want to know who we are, you have to come experience us.And think about the economic value they have providedby that experience.Right? Coffee, at its core, is what?Right? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.You know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean?Two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.But grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf,and now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents,when you treat it as a good.Take that same good,and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer,in a corner diner, in a bodega, a kiosk somewhere,you get 50 cents, maybe a buckper cup of coffee.But surround the brewing of that coffeewith the ambiance of a Starbucks,with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there,and now, because of that authentic experience,you can charge two, three, four, five dollarsfor a cup of coffee.So, authenticity is becomingthe new consumer sensibility.Let me summarize it, for the business people in the audience,with three rules, three basic rules.One, don't say you're authenticunless you really are authentic.Two, it's easier to be authenticif you don't say you're authentic.And three, if you say you're authentic,you better be authentic.And then for the consumers, for everyone else in the audience,let me simply summarize it by saying, increasingly,what we -- what will make us happy,is spending our time and our moneysatisfying the desire for authenticity.Thank you.

I was listed on the online biographythat said I was a design missionary.That's a bit lofty; I'm really moreof something like a street walker.I spend a lot of time in urban areaslooking for design,and studying design in the public sector.I take about 5,000 photographs a year,and I thought that I would edit from these,and try to come up with some imagesthat might be appropriate and interesting to you.And I used three criteria:the first was, I thought I'd talk aboutreal design within reach,design that's free, not design not quite within reach,as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors,but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free,stuff that was available to all people,and stuff that probably contains some other important messages.I'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example.A very common public design done in the '50s.It's got a nice kind of flowing, organic form,very consistent with the Brazilian culture --I think good design adds to culture.Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York.But I think these are my sort of information highways:I live in much more of an analog world,where pedestrian traffic andinteraction and diversity exchange,and where I think the simple things under our feethave a great amount of meaning to us.How did I get started in this business?I was a ceramic designer for about 10 years,and just loved utilitarian form --simple things that we use every day,little compositions of color and surface on form.This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach,a company dealing with simple forms,making good designers available to us,and also selling the personalities and character of the designersas well, and it seems to have worked.A couple of years into the process,I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design.And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam:I was there going into the design stores,and mixing with our crowd of designers,and I recognized that a whole lot of stuffpretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalizationhas had that in our community also.We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world,and it's getting increasingly more difficultto find design that reflects a unique culture.I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdamand I recognized, you know, the big storyfrom Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores,it's what's out on the streets,and maybe it's self-explanatory,but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism,that's preserved its kind of architecture and character,and where the bicycle plays an important part of the wayin which people get around and where pedestrian rightsare protected.And I write a newsletter that goes out every week,and I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous responsethat I realized that design, that common design,that's in the public area means a lot to people,and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog.I then kind of thought about the other citiesin Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design,like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy --all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles,and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhapsthere was something about these important design centersthat dealt with bicycles and foot traffic,and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation thereis that there are universities and schoolswhere people can't afford cars,but it did seem that in many of these areaspedestrian traffic was protected.You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike:a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum.But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdamand recognized, you know, the first job of designis to serve a social purpose.And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike,but being a very good example of design.And since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of timein the cities, looking at designfor common evidence of designthat really isn't under so much of a designer's signature.I was in Buenos Aires very recently,and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava.He's a Spanish architect and designer.And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge --I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally --and it was a bit of a disappointment,because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.And I recognized that oftentimes design,when you're set up to see design,it can be a bit of a letdown.But there were lots of other things going on in this area:it was a kind of construction zone;a lot of buildings were going up.And, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much;you get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little compositionthat might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something.But to me it was an example ofindustrial materials with a little bit of colors and animationand a nice little still life -- kind of unintended piece of design.And going a little closer, you get a different perspective.I find these little vignettes,these little accidental pieces of design,to be refreshing.They give me, I don't know,a sense of correctness in the worldand some visual delight in the knowledgethat the building will probably never look as goodas this simple industrial scaffoldingthat is there to serve.Down the road, there was another building, a nice visual structure:horizontal, vertical elements, little decorative linesgoing across, these magenta squiggles,the workmen being reduced to decorative elements,just a nice, kind of, breakupof the urban place.And, you know, that no longer exists.You've captured it for a moment, and finding this little still life'slike listening to little songs or something:it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure.Antoine Predock designeda wonderful ball stadium in San Diegocalled Petco Park.A terrific use of local materials,but inside you could find some interior compositions.Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games;I go and see design relationships.Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture,and the way that the trees form vertical elements.Red is a color in the landscapethat is often on stop signs.It takes your attention; it has a great amount of emotion;it stares back at you the way that a figure might.Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy.Construction site in New York:red having this kind of emotional powerthat's almost an equivalent with the way in which --cuteness of puppies and such.Side street in Italy.Red drew me into this little composition,optimistic to me in the sense that maybethe public service's mailbox,door service, plumbing.It looks as if these different public serviceswork together to create some nice little compositions.In Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good.Simple menus put on a board,achieving, kind of, the sort of balance.But I'm convinced that it's becauseyou're walking around the streets and seeing things.Red can be comical: it can draw your attentionto the poor little personality of the little fire hydrantsuffering from bad civic planning in Havana.Color can animate simple blocks,simple materials:walking in New York, I'll stop.I don't always know why I take photographs of things.A nice visual composition of symmetry.Curves against sharp things.It's a comment on the way in which we deal withpublic seating in the city of New York.I've come across some other just,kind of, curious relationshipsof bollards on the street that have different interpretations,but -- these things amuse me.Sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in San Francisco --a trash can that's been left there for 18 monthscreates a nice 45-degree angleagainst these other relationships,and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture.So, there's this sort of silent hand of design at workthat I see in places that I go.Havana is a wonderful area.It's quite free of commercial clutter:you don't see our logos and brands and names,and therefore you're alert to things physically.And this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone,and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that.And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful,because of the blockades and things,but a really wonderful playground.I've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design.In our area, in furnishings,they're sort of way at the top.The Dutch are good also, but the Italians are good.And I came across this little street in Venice,where the communist headquarterswere sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine.And I realized that, you know, Italy is a placewhere they can accept these different ideologiesand deal with diversity and not have the problem,or they can choose to ignore them,but these -- you don't have warring factions,and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurditywhich has made Italy so innovativeand so tolerant.The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also,and I think that it's recognizable there,and has an important effect on culture,because their public spaces are protected,their sidewalks are protected,and you're actually able to confront these thingsphysically,and I think this helps people get overtheir fear of modernism and other such things.A change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco.And I use this -- this is, sort of,what I consider to be urban spam.I notice this stuff because I walk a lot,but here, private industry is really kind ofmaking a mess of the public sector.And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know,the publications that report on problems in the urban areaalso contribute to it,and it's just my call to say to all of us,public policy won't change this at all;private industry has to work to take things like this seriously.The extreme might be in Italy where, again,there's kind of some type of controlover what's happening in the environment is very evident,even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals.I walk to work every day or ride my scooter,and I come down and park in this little spot.And I came down one day,and all the bikes were red.Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,but this was an actual momentwhen I got off my bike,and I looked and I thought, it's as ifall of my biker brethrenhad kind of gotten together and conspiredto make a little statement.And it reminded me that --to keep in the present,to look out for these kinds of things.It gave me possibilities for wonder --if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree,and create some installations.But it also reminded me of the powerof pattern and repetitionto make an effect in our mind.And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effectthan pattern and the way it uniteskind of disparate elements.I was at the art show in Miami in December,and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art,and amazed at the prices of artand how expensive it is, but having a great time looking at it.And I came outside, and the valets for this car servicehad created, you know, quite a nice little collageof these car keys,and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tagsthat I had seen in Tokyo.And I thought that ifpattern can unite these disparate elements,it can do just about anything.I don't have very many shots of people,I was in a small restaurant in Spain,having lunch --one of those nice days whereyou had the place kind of to yourself,and you have a glass of wine, and enjoying the local areaand the culture and the foodand the quiet, and feeling very lucky,and a bus load of tourists arrived,emptied out,filled up the restaurant.In a very short period of time,completely changed the atmosphereand character with loud voices and large bodies and such,and we had to get up and leave;it was just that uncomfortable.And at that moment, the sun came out,and through this perforated screen,a pattern was cast over these bodiesand they kind of faded into the rear,and we left the restaurant kind offeeling O.K. about stuff.And I do think patternhas the capability of eradicatingsome of the most evilforces of society,such as bad form in restaurants,but quite seriously, it was a statement to methat one thing that you do, sort of, seeis the aggressive natureof the industrial world has produced --kind of,large masses of things,and when you -- in monoculture,and I think the preservation of diversity in cultureis something that's important to us.The last shots that I have deal with --coming back to this theme of sidewalks,and I wanted tosay something here about -- I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know.Post-Second World War,the influence of the automobilehas really been devastating in a lot of our cities.A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lotsin a sort of indiscriminate use.A lot of the planning departments became subordinatedto the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on carsas it is on Wal-Mart;I'm not going to do that.But they're real examples in urbanizationand the change that's occurred in the last number of years,and the heightened sensitivity to the importanceof our urban environments as cultural centers.I think that they are, that the statements that we makein this public sectorare our contributionsto a larger whole.Cities are the place where we're most likelyto encounter diversityand to mix with other people.We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things.But I think people have recognizedthe sanctity of our urban areas.A place like Chicagohas really reached kind of a level of international stature.The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind ofenlightened urban planning and renewal,and I want to single out a place like Chicago,where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design herofor being able to work through thepolitical processes and all that to improve an area.You would expect a city like this to haveupgraded flower boxeson Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop,but if you actually go along the street you findthe flower boxes change from street to street:there's actual diversity in the plants.And the idea that a city group can maintaindifferent types of foliageis really quite exceptional.There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago,and then there are your big-D design statements:the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry.My measure of this as being an important bit of designis not so much the way that it looks,but the fact that it performs a very important social function.There are a lot of free concerts, for example,that go on in this area;it has a phenomenal acoustic system.But the commitment that the city has made to the public areais significant, and almost an international model.I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco,on the International Design Council for Mayors,and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle,and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there.I thought that I should include at least oneshot of technology for you guys.This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago,where the Spanish artist-designer Plensahas created, kind of,a digital readout in this parkthat reflects backthe characters and personalitiesof the people in this area.And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity,reflective of diversity, and I thinkthis marriage of both technology and artin the public sector is an area where the U.S.can really take a leadership role,and Chicago is one example.Thank you very much.

40,000, actually.as a matter of fact.called Yenching Palace in Washington, DC,which unfortunately is closed now,and about to be turned into Walgreen's.And the house where John Wilkes Boothon H Street in Washington.(Laughter)And it's not completely gratuitous,so it kind of works out.they've actually brought it into space.on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.So, let me present the question to you:versus how often do you eat Chinese food?(Laughter)And if you think about it,are barely recognizable to Chinese.[What is this?][Should I try it?][Try it!][What is this called?][Fortune cookie.](Laughter)[There's a piece of paper inside!](Laughter)[What is this?][You've won a prize!][What is this?][It's a fortune!][Tasty!]So where are they from?If you see them side by side,there's yellow and brown.so they're not as sweet as our version.So how did they get to the US?including at least one in Los Angeles,that we saw back in Kyoto.The interesting question is:to being something that is Chinese?including those that made fortune cookies.So that's when the Chinese moved in,saw a market opportunity and took over.(Laughter)popularized by the Chinese,but ultimately consumed by Americans.They're more American than anything else.Another of my favorite dishes:is called Admiral Tso's Chicken.(Laughter)I love this dish.And he has marched very far indeed,all things that Americans love.(Laughter)He has marched so far, actually,Video: (In Chinese)Audience: (Laughter)He's in Taiwan right now.After I showed him this, he got up,Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable;That was a picture of General Tso.I went to his home town.This is a billboard that says:And I went looking for chicken.Finally found a cow --and did find chicken.(Laughter)who are still in the town.this guy is about seven.and they were like,because in their eyes he is, after all,a famous Qing dynasty military hero.and baby brother of Jesus Christ.So, you know, I realized when I was there,According to the New York Times in 1904,and as this article points out,one culture ever played on another,called 'leftovers.'"(Laughter)Right?(Laughter)And not only that:"This dish is particularly popular(Laughter)So, why and where did chop suey come from?Let's go back to the mid-1800s,when the Chinese first came to America.in 1883 ran an article that asked,"Do Chinese eat rats?"not so outlandish.from the late 1800s.but to the Chinese in their midst,must be different from us.is through documents like this.This is in the Library of Congress.hero of our American labor movement.Which shall survive?"And it basically made the argumentthat Chinese men who ate ricefor American men who ate meat.And as a matter of fact, then,So, with sentiments like these,the only time in American historywhen a group was specifically excludedfor its national origin or ethnicity.Who came up with the idea of chop suey?but of the ones I've found,A Chinese guy named Lem Sen"I want you all to stop making chop suey,And the way he tells it,and could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.or pay me for the right to do the same.doesn't exist only in America.For example, there is French Chinese food,so they serve fried gelato."Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."(Laughter)Even the Brits have their own version.Japanese Chinese food,(Laughter)and just ramenize them.So, there's Peruvian Chinese food,(Laughter)I've encountered around the world(Laughter)So, let's take a step back and understandwhat is to be appreciated in America.in post-World War II America.But you know what?but without a centralized headquarters.So, this actually became very clear to mewith the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing,like it was a diamond, or diagonal.So they looked at an episode of "Lost."Now, I don't have a TV,(Laughter)"Where did you get your number?"He said, "I got it from a fortune cookie."This is a slip one of the winners had,were like, "Oh, no, this can't be true."But it was true.Basically, of those 110 people,(Laughter)Yeah. So I went and started looking.and a bunch of them named "China Buffet."A good contrast is Chicken McNuggets.that's kind of an easy concept.in a cost-efficient manner,In contrast is General Tso's Chicken,(Laughter)And this logo!from a restaurant in New York City.Americans will love this."sort of an open-source thing, right?(Laughter)across the entire system,depending on the region.What had happened was,and brought that with them.So the thing is,and Ray Kroc with McDonald'sand Asa Candler with Coca-Cola.can often have had as much, if not more,impact on what we eat today.Thank you very much.(Applause)

I'm just going to play a brief video clip.Video:On the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was soldfor 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record.The buyerwas Kip Forbes,son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century.The original owner of the bottle turned out to beone of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century.Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world,the prince of any wine cellar.Benjamin Wallace: Now, that's about all the videotape that remains of an eventthat set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world.And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock.In 1985, he announced to his friends in the wine worldthat he had made this incredible discovery.Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall,and happened upon this hidden cache of wines --apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles,and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.The mystery persisted for about 20 years.It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles,and he became suspicious.And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBIand ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this.There's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man,and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes.But for those 20 years,an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figuresin the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles.I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of winein the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world,must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.I became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question ofyou know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money,not only on wine but on lots of things,and are they living a better life than me?So, I decided to embark on a quest.With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes,I decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted itemin about a dozen categories,(Laughter)This was the first one.A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.It may come from Wagyu cattle,but it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe,and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.I went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.And it arrived, and it was tiny.And I was outraged.It was like, 160 dollars for this?And then I took a bite,and I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak.I almost couldn't finish it.I was really happy when I was done.(Laughter)Now, the photographer who took the pictures for this projectfor some reason posed his dog in a lot of them,so that's why you're going to see this recurring character.Which, I guess, you know, communicates to youthat I did not think that one was really worth the price.White truffles.One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world.To try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurantin Manhattan -- Del Posto.The waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knoband his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know,"Would Signore like the truffles?"And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma.It's not in their taste, really. It's not in their texture.It's in the smell.These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles,this haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up.10 seconds passed and it was gone.And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that,you know, their purpose had been served,and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me.There were several -- several of these items were disappointments.(Laughter)Yeah.The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there.(Laughter)They did give me a tour, though.And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.It has 360-degree views.It has four balconies.It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from.When I took the tour, it actually included some Opus One, I was glad to see.30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel.This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles,which have antibacterial properties.I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this.And it, you know, tickled a little bit and it smelled good,but I have to say that nobody herehas complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today.(Laughter)But then again, nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing.These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you,not only did I not get a compliment from any of you,I have not gotten a compliment from anybodyin the months that I have owned and worn these.I don't think that whether or not you're getting a complimentshould be the test of something's value,but I think in the case of a fashion item, an article of clothing,that's a reasonable benchmark.That said, a lot of work goes into these.They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cottonthat has been shuttle loomedand then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times.But no compliments.(Laughter)Thank you.Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oilfrom an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany.And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light.He uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted,he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it,he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online,so you can go online and look at your batch numberand see how the phenolics are developing,and, you know, gauge its freshness.I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.It was very green, it was very peppery.But in the blind taste test, it came in last.The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle ofWhole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stovefor six months.(Laughter)A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan --you'll start to notice.I don't play golf, so I couldn't actually road test these,but I did interview a guy who owns them.Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean, they'll saythese have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speedand thereby drive the ball farther -- but they'll say, look, you know,you're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs.You're paying for the bling,that they're encrusted with gold and platinum.The guy who I interviewed who owns them did saythat he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them, so ...Oh, yeah, you know this one?This is a coffee made from a very unusual process.The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.It's a cat that lives in trees,and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations.And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know,hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans,and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavingsthen go through the forest collecting the, you know, resultsand processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy itin the unprocessed form.That's right.Unrelatedly --(Laughter)Japan is doing crazy things with toilets.(Laughter)There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it.There's one with a fragrance dispenser.There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowland transmits the results via email to your doctor.It's almost like a home medical center --and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in.This one does not have those bells and whistles,but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600.And to try this -- I couldn't get a loaner,but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer, Toto,and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use, which I used.It's fully automated -- you walk towards it, and the seat lifts.The seat is preheated.There's a water jet that cleans you.There's an air jet that dries you.You get up, it flushes by itself.The lid closes, it self-cleans.Not only is it a technological leap forward,but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward.I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.And I want to get one of these.(Laughter)This was another one I could not get a loaner of.Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.There's a little plaque on the end that, you know,each buyer gets their name engraved on it.(Laughter)To try this one, the maker of it let me and my wifespend the night in the Manhattan showroom.Lights glaring in off the street,and we had to hire a security guard and all these things.But anyway, we had a great night's sleep.And you spend a third of your life in bed.I don't think it's that bad of a deal.(Laughter)This was a fun one.This is the fastest street-legal car in the worldand the most expensive production car.I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company,a professional race car driver,and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angelesand down on the Pacific Coast Highway.And, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplightthe people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods.And it was really amazing.It was such a smooth ride.Most of the cars that I drive, if I get up to 80 they start to rattle.I switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said,"You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour."And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious peopleyou occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic,because it was just that smooth.And if I was a billionaire, I would get one.(Laughter)This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to showof one of the pitfalls of advanced technology.This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "Mission: Impossible III" premiere.When he tries to open the door,you could call it "Mission: Impossible IV."There was one object that I could not get my hands on,and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc.The '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century.And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeauxin having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape.And 1947 was a legendary vintage,especially in the right bank of Bordeaux.And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aurathat eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.But it's 60 years old.There's not much of it left.What there is of it left you don't know if it's real --it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world.Not that many people are looking to pop opentheir one remaining bottle for a journalist.So, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these.I'd put out feelers to retailers, to auctioneers,and it was coming up empty.And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai.Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicistwho also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings,and he said, "I've got a tasting coming upwhere we're going to serve the '47 Cheval Blanc."And it was going to be a double vertical --it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc,and 30 vintages of Yquem.And it was an invitation you do not refuse.I went.It was three days, four meals.And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.And you know, it had this fragrant softness,and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.And then I tasted it, and it,you know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness,which is characteristic of that wine --that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways.There were people at my table who thought it was, you know, fantastic.There were some people who were a little less impressed.And I wasn't that impressed.And I don't -- call my palate a philistine palate --so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed,but I was not the only one there who had that reaction.And it wasn't just to that wine.Any one of the wines served at this tasting,if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know,the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable.But drinking 60 great wines over three days,they all just blurred together,and it became almost a grueling experience.And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting studywhich came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech.And they gave subjects the same wine,labeled with different price tags.A lot of people, you know,said that they liked the more expensive wine more --it was the same wine, but they thought it was a different onethat was more expensive.But what was unexpected was that these researchers didMRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine,and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more --their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasurefrom the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag.Thank you.

These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years,and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet.This is an example of a real meteorite,and you can see all the melting of the ironfrom the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth,and just how much of it survives and melts.From a meteorite from space,we’re over here with an original Sputnik.This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space.This is not a copy.The space age began 50 years ago in October,and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like.And it wouldn’t be fun to talk about the space agewithout seeing a flag that was carriedto the moon and back, on Apollo 11.The astronauts each got to carryabout ten silk flags in their personal kits.They would bring them back and mount them.So this has actually been carried to the moonand back.So that’s for fun.The dawn of books is, of course, important.And it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of bookswithout having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenbergin 1455.But what’s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology,is not the book.You see, the book was not driven by reading.In 1455, nobody could read.So why did the printing press succeed?This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible.So you’re looking here at one of the first printed booksusing movable type in the history of man,550 years ago.We are living at the age here at the end of the book,where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it.But why is this so interesting? Here’s the quick story.It turns out that in the 1450s,the Catholic Church needed money,and so theyactually hand-wrote these things called indulgences,which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper.They traveled all around Europeand sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.They got you out of purgatory faster.And when the printing press was inventedwhat they found was they could print indulgences,which was the equivalent of printing money.And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in 1455 --to print out thousands,and then hundreds of thousands,and then ultimately millionsof single, small pieces of paperthat got you out of middle hell and into heaven.That is why the printing press succeeded,and that is why Martin Luthernailed his 90 theses to the door:because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amokin printing out indulgences and selling themin every town and village and city in all of Western Europe.So the printing press, ladies and gentlemen,was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenessesand had nothing to do with reading.More tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the libraryfor those of you that have asked for pictures.We’re going to have some tomorrow.(Applause)Instead of showing an object from the stageI’m going to do something special for the first time.We are going to show, actually, what the library looks like, OK?So, I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world.You’re going to find out why in a minute,because when I went to see Eileen,this is what I said I wanted to build.This is the Library of Human Imagination.The room itself is three stories tall.In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imaginationthat are computer controlled.The room is a theatre. It changes colors.And all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.It’s designed like an Escher print.Here is some of the lower level of the library,where the exhibits constantly change.You can walk through. You can touch.You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room.There’s my very own Saturn V.Everybody should have one, OK? (Laughter)So you can see here in the lower level of the librarythe books and the objects.In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination.There is a glass bridge that you walk acrossthat’s suspended in space.So it’s a leap of imagination.How do we create?Part of the question that I have answered is,is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli:with human achievement, with history,with the things that drive us and make us human --the passionate discovery, the bones of dinosaurs long gone,the maps of space that we’ve experienced,and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination.So hopefully tomorrow I’ll showone or two more objects from the stage,but for today I just wanted to say thank youfor all the people that came and talked to us about it.And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our homeand share it with the TED community.(Applause)TED is all about patterns in the clouds.It’s all about connections.It’s all about seeing thingsthat everybody else has seen beforebut thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.And that’s really what discovery and imagination is all about.For example, we can lookat a DNA molecule model here.None of us really have ever seen one,but we know it exists because we’ve been taughtto understand this molecule.But we can also look at an Enigma machinefrom the Nazis in World War IIthat was a coding and decoding machine.Now, you might say, what does this have to do with this?Well, this is the code for life,and this is a code for death.These two moleculescode and decode.And yet, looking at them, you would see a machine and a molecule.But once you’ve seen them in a new way,you realize that both of these things really are connected.And they’re connected primarily because of this here.You see, this is a human brain model, OK?And it’s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.We get to see a skull. But there it is.All of imagination -- everything that we think,we feel, we sense -- comes through the human brain.And once we create new patterns in this brain,once we shape the brain in a new way,it never returns to its original shape.And I’ll give you a quick example.We think about the Internet;we think about information that goes across the Internet.And we never think about the hidden connection.But I brought along here a lump of coal --right here, one lump of coal.And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet?You see, it takes the energy in one lump of coalto move one megabyte of information across the net.So every time you download a file,each megabyte is a lump of coal.What that means is, a 200-megabyte filelooks like this, ladies and gentlemen. OK?So the next time you download a gigabyte,or two gigabytes, it’s not for free, OK?The connection is the energy it takes to run the web ,and to make everything we think possible, possible.Thanks, Chris.(Applause)

Unless we do something to prevent it,over the next 40 years we’re facing an epidemicof neurologic diseases on a global scale.A cheery thought.On this map, every country that’s colored bluehas more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65.This is the world we live in.And this is the world your children will live in.For 12,000 years, the distribution of ages in the human populationhas looked like a pyramid, with the oldest on top.It’s already flattening out.By 2050, it’s going to be a column and will start to invert.This is why it’s happening.The average lifespan’s more than doubled since 1840,and it’s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day.And this is why that’s not entirely a good thing:because over the age of 65, your risk of getting Alzheimer’sor Parkinson’s disease will increase exponentially.By 2050, there’ll be about 32 million people in the United Statesover the age of 80, and unless we do something about it,half of them will have Alzheimer’s diseaseand three million more will have Parkinson’s disease.Right now, those and other neurologic diseases --for which we have no cure or prevention --cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year.It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050.Alzheimer’s disease starts when a proteinthat should be folded up properlymisfolds into a kind of demented origami.So one approach we’re taking is to try to design drugsthat function like molecular Scotch tape,to hold the protein into its proper shape.That would keep it from forming the tanglesthat seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.Interestingly enough, other neurologic diseaseswhich affect very different parts of the brainalso show tangles of misfolded protein,which suggests that the approach might be a general one,and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases,not just Alzheimer’s disease.There’s also a fascinating connection to cancer here,because people with neurologic diseaseshave a very low incidence of most cancers.And this is a connection that most people aren’t pursuing right now,but which we’re fascinated by.Most of the important and all of the creative work in this areais being funded by private philanthropies.And there’s tremendous scope for additional private help here,because the government has dropped the ball on much of this, I’m afraid.In the meantime, while we’re waiting for all these things to happen,here’s what you can do for yourself.If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson’s disease,caffeine is protective to some extent; nobody knows why.Head injuries are bad for you. They lead to Parkinson’s disease.And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer’s disease,well, it turns out that fish oil has the effectof reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease.You should also keep your blood pressure down,because chronic high blood pressureis the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.It’s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma,which is just Alzheimer’s disease of the eye.And of course, when it comes to cognitive effects,"use it or lose it" applies,so you want to stay mentally stimulated.But hey, you’re listening to me.So you’ve got that covered.And one final thing. Wish people like me luck, okay?Because the clock is ticking for all of us.Thank you.

Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity.Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful.Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom,make education seem like a bright idea.(Laughter)Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation,or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so.Great creativity can make politicians electable,or parties unelectable.It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirtsand phrases on our lips.It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple roadthrough an impenetrable moral maze.Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable,more magical. And now we need that magic.This is a time of need.Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly.And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well:to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements.To tempt us to act differentlywith delightful creative scraps.Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved inusing creativity to inspire people to be greener.(Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk.Narrator: And so he walked, and as he walked he saw things.Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen.A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle.A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall.And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her.The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fieldsand broken his heart.Sure, she had aged a little.In fact, she had aged a lot.But he felt all his old passion for her return."Ford," he called softly. For that was her name."Don't say another word, Gusty," she said,for that was his name."I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here.Let's go there and make love. In the tent."Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmicallywhile she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.The earth moved for both of them.And they lived together happily ever after.And all because he decided to walk that day.(Applause)Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate.The moral imperative is on the table.Great creativity is needed to take it all,make it simple and sharp.To make it connect. To make it make people want to act.So this is a call, a plea,to the incredibly talented TED community.Let's get creative against climate change.And let's do it soon. Thank you.(Applause)

What technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty?And what I found was quite surprising.We started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century,and how they'd been improved, and very simple things turned out.You'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water,but it's actually the opposite.And so very simple things -- off-the-shelf technologiesthat we could easily find on the then-early Web --would clearly make a huge difference to that problem.But I also, in looking at more powerful technologiesand nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emergingkind of digital technologies, became very concernedabout the potential for abuse.If you think about it, in history, a long, long time agowe dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual.We came up with something -- the Ten Commandments: Thou shalt not kill.That's a, kind of a one-on-one thing.We organized into cities. We had many people.And to keep the many from tyrannizing the one,we came up with concepts like individual liberty.And then, to have to deal with large groups,say, at the nation-state level,and we had to have mutual non-aggression,or through a series of conflicts, we eventually came toa rough international bargain to largely keep the peace.But now we have a new situation, really what people callan asymmetric situation, where technology is so powerfulthat it extends beyond a nation-state.It's not the nation-states that have potential accessto mass destruction, but individuals.And this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital.We saw genome sequences.You can download the gene sequencesof pathogens off the Internet if you want to,and clearly someone recently -- I saw in a science magazine --they said, well, the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around.If people want to use it in their labs for working on research,just reconstruct it yourself,because, you know, it might break in FedEx.So that this is possible to do this is not deniable.So individuals in small groups super-empowered by access to thesekinds of self-replicating technologies, whether it be biologicalor other, are clearly a danger in our world.And the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic.And we really don't have experience with pandemics,and we're also not very good as a society at actingto things we don't have direct and sort of gut-level experience with.So it's not in our nature to pre-act.And in this case, piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem,because it only super-empowers people more.So the solution has to be, as people like Russell and Einsteinand others imagine in a conversation that existedin a much stronger form, I think, early in the 20th century,that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart.You know, public policy and moral progress.The bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power.We get our individual rights by society protecting us from othersnot doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal.And so to limit the danger of these new things, we have to limit,ultimately, the ability of individualsto have access, essentially, to pandemic power.We also have to have sensible defense, because no limitationis going to prevent a crazy person from doing something.And you know, and the troubling thing is thatit's much easier to do something bad than to defendagainst all possible bad things,so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage.So these are the kind of thoughts I was thinking in 1999 and 2000,and my friends told me I was getting really depressed,and they were really worried about me.And then I signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about thisand moved into a hotel room in New Yorkwith one room full of books on the Plague,and you know, nuclear bombs exploding in New Yorkwhere I would be within the circle, and so on.And then I was there on September 11th,and I stood in the streets with everyone.And it was quite an experience to be there.I got up the next morning and walked out of the city,and all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Streetand ready to go down and start taking the rubble away.And I walked down the middle, up to the train station,and everything below 14th Street was closed.It was quite a compelling experience, but not really, I suppose,a surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books.It was always a surprise that it happened then and there,but it wasn't a surprise that it happened at all.And everyone then started writing about this.Thousands of people started writing about this.And I eventually abandoned the book, and then Chris called meto talk at the conference. I really don't talk about this anymorebecause, you know, there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on.But I agreed to come and say a few things about this.And I would say that we can't give up the rule of lawto fight an asymmetric threat, which is what we seem to be doingbecause of the present, the people that are in power,because that's to give up the thing that makes civilization.And we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing,because a million-dollar actcauses a billion dollars of damage, causes a trillion dollar responsewhich is largely ineffective and arguably, probably almost certainly,has made the problem worse.So we can't fight the thing with a million-to-one cost,one-to-a-million cost-benefit ratio.So after giving up on the book -- and I had the great honorto be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago,and to work through venture capital on the innovative side,and to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw assome of these big problems.Things where, you know, a factor of 10 differencecan make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome.I've been amazed in the last year at the incredible qualityand excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk.It's overwhelming at times. I'm very thankful for Google and Wikipediaso I can understand at least a little of what people are talking aboutwho come through the doors.But I wanted to share with you three areasthat I'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problemsthat I was talking about in the Wired article.The first is this whole area of education,and it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a $100 computer.And that is to say that there's a lot of legs left in Moore's Law.The most advanced transistors today are at 65 nanometers,and we've seen, and I've had the pleasure to investin, companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend Moore's Lawall the way down to roughly the 10 nanometer scale.Another factor of, say, six in dimensional reduction,which should give us about another factor of 100 in raw improvementin what the chips can do. And so, to put that in practical terms,if something costs about 1,000 dollars today,say, the best personal computer you can buy, that might be its cost,I think we can have that in 2020 for 10 dollars. Okay?Now, just imagine what that $100 computer will be in 2020as a tool for education.I think the challenge for us is --I'm very certain that that will happen, the challenge is,will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the netto let us take advantage of that device?I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers,but we don't have very good software for them.And it's only in retrospect, after the better software comes along,and you take it and you run it on a ten-year-old machine, you say,God, the machine was that fast?I remember when they took the Apple Mac interfaceand they put it back on the Apple II.The Apple II was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface,we just didn't know how to do it at the time.So given that we know and should believe --because Moore's Law's been, like, a constant,I mean, it's just been very predictable progressover the last 40 years or whatever.We can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020.It's great that we have initiatives to say,let's go create the education and educate people in the world,because that's a great force for peace.And we can give everyone in the world a $100 computeror a $10 computer in the next 15 years.The second area that I'm focusing on is the environmental problem,because that's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on this world.We'll hear a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly.The thing that we see as the kind of Moore's Law trendthat's driving improvement in our ability to addressthe environmental problem is new materials.We have a challenge, because the urban population is growingin this century from two billion to six billionin a very short amount of time. People are moving to the cities.They all need clean water, they need energy, they need transportation,and we want them to develop in a green way.We're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors.We've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency,but the consumer sector, especially in America, is very inefficient.But these new materials bring such incredible innovationsthat there's a strong basis for hope that these thingswill be so profitable that they can be brought to the market.And I want to give you a specific example of a new materialthat was discovered 15 years ago.If we take carbon nanotubes, you know, Iijima discovered them in 1991,they just have incredible properties.And these are the kinds of things we're going to discoveras we start to engineer at the nano scale.Their strength: they're almost the strongest material,tensile strength material known.They're very, very stiff. They stretch very, very little.In two dimensions, if you make, like, a fabric out of them,they're 30 times stronger than Kevlar.And if you make a three-dimensional structure, like a buckyball,they have all sorts of incredible properties.If you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them,they repair themselves; they go zip and they repair the holein femtoseconds, which is not -- is really quick.(Laughter)If you shine a light on them, they produce electricity.In fact, if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire.If you put electricity on them, they emit light.If you run current through them, you can run 1,000 times more currentthrough one of these than through a piece of metal.You can make both p- and n-type semiconductors,which means you can make transistors out of them.They conduct heat along their length but not across --well, there is no width, but not in the other directionif you stack them up; that's a property of carbon fiber also.If you put particles in them, and they go shooting out the tip --they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns.The inside of the nanotubes is so small --the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers --that it's basically a quantum world.It's a strange place inside a nanotube.And so we begin to see, and we've seen business plans already,where the kind of things Lisa Randall's talking about are in there.I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more aboutWitten's cosmic dimension strings to try to understandwhat the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial.So inside of a nanotube, we're really at the limit here.So what we see is with these and other new materialsthat we can do things with different properties -- lighter, stronger --and apply these new materials to the environmental problems.New materials that can make water,new materials that can make fuel cells work better,new materials that catalyze chemical reactions,that cut pollution and so on.Ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol.New ways of making electric transportation.The whole green dream -- because it can be profitable.And we've dedicated -- we've just raised a new fund,we dedicated 100 million dollars to these kinds of investments.We believe that Genentech, the Compaq, the Lotus, the Sun,the Netscape, the Amazon, the Google in these fieldsare yet to be found, because this materials revolutionwill drive these things forward.The third area that we're working on,and we just announced last week -- we were all in New York.We raised 200 million dollars in a specialty fundto work on a pandemic in biodefense.And to give you an idea of the last fund that Kleiner raisedwas a $400 million fund, so this for us is a very substantial fund.And what we did, over the last few months -- well, a few months ago,Ray Kurzweil and I wrote an op-ed in the New York Timesabout how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous.And John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned, [unclear],and we started looking around at what the world was doingabout being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps.And so we asked ourselves, you know, can we find innovative thingsthat will go fill these gaps? And Brooks told me in a break here,he said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep,because there's so many great technologies out there,we're essentially buried. And we need them, you know.We have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpilingthat still works, roughly. That's Tamiflu.But Tamiflu -- the virus is resistant. It is resistant to Tamiflu.We've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work wellso that the viral resistance -- we need several anti-virals.We need better surveillance.We need networks that can find out what's going on.We need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody hasa strain of flu which we have only identified very recently.We've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly.We need new anti-virals and cocktails. We need new kinds of vaccines.Vaccines that are broad spectrum.Vaccines that we can manufacture quickly.Cocktails, more polyvalent vaccines.You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains.We need -- we don't know where this thing is going.We believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps,we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic.And the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemicis about a factor of 1,000 in deathsand certainly enormous economic impact.So we're very excited because we think we can fund 10,or speed up 10 projects and see them come to marketin the next couple years that will address this.So if we can address, use technology, help address education,help address the environment, help address the pandemic,does that solve the larger problem that I was talking aboutin the Wired article? And I'm afraid the answer is really no,because you can't solve a problem with the management of technologywith more technology.If we let an unlimited amount of power loose, then we will --a very small number of people will be able to abuse it.We can't fight at a million-to-one disadvantage.So what we need to do is, we need better policy.And for example, some things we could dothat would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right nowbut perhaps with the change of administration would be -- use markets.Markets are a very strong force.For example, rather than trying to regulate away problems,which probably won't work, if we could priceinto the cost of doing business, the cost of catastrophe,so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophewould have to take insurance against that risk.So if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on.But it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators;you'd have to convince an actuary that it would be safe.And if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly,you can use a more powerful force, a market force,to provide feedback.How could you keep the law?I think the law would be a really good thing to keep.Well, you have to hold people accountable.The law requires accountability.Today scientists, technologists, businessmen, engineersdon't have any personal responsibilityfor the consequences of their actions.So if you tie that -- you have to tie that back with the law.And finally, I think we have to do something that's not really --it's almost unacceptable to say this -- which,we have to begin to design the future.We can't pick the future, but we can steer the future.Our investment in trying to prevent pandemic fluis affecting the distribution of possible outcomes.We may not be able to stop it, but the likelihoodthat it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem.So we can design the future if we choose what kind of thingswe want to have happen and not have happen,and steer us to a lower-risk place.Vice President Gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectoryinto a lower probability of catastrophic risk.But above all, what we have to do is we have to help the good guys,the people on the defensive side,have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things.And what we have to do to do thatis we have to limit access to certain information.And growing up as we have, and holding very highthe value of free speech, this is a hard thing for us to accept --for all of us to accept.It's especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember,you know, Galileo essentially locked up,and who are still fighting this battle against the church.But that's the price of having a civilization.The price of retaining the rule of lawis to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power.Thank you.(Applause)

I have, like, a thing about sleeping.I don't sleep that much,and I've come to this thing about, like, not sleeping muchas being a great virtue, after years of kind ofbattling it as being a terrible detriment, or something.And now I really like sort of sitting up, you know.But for years I've been sitting upand I think that, like, my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia.I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly.Sometimes I used to walk more at night.I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting.(Laughter)And sometimes -- actually, once it was on Page Six in the Post,that I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever,but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on.And so I was following this guy.And I took a picture of his shoes,and we thanked each other and just went on our way.But I do that all the time.As a matter of fact, I think a lot of my design ideascome from mistakes and tricks of the eye.Because I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there,so many clothes out there.And the only ones that look interesting to meare the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course,or very, very surprising.And often, I'm driving in a taxiand I see a hole in a shirt, or somethingthat looks very interesting or pretty or functionalin some way that I'd never seen happen before.And so I'd make the car stop, and I'd get out of the car and walk,and see that in fact there wasn't a hole, but it was a trick of my eye,it was a shadow, you know.Or if there was a hole I'd think like, oh damn,there was actually someone thought of that thought already.Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore.I don't know where inspiration comes from.It does not come for me from research.I don't get necessarily inspired by research.As a matter of fact, one of the most fun thingsI've ever, ever done in my whole life,was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York.I read "Peter and the Wolf" with this beautiful band from Juilliard.And I did like, you know, the narrator, and I read it.And I saw this really smart critic who I love.This woman, Joan Acocella, who's a friend of mine,and she came backstage and she said,oh, you know, Isaac, did you know that, talking about Stalinismand talking about, you know, like the '30s in Russia.And I said, how do I know about Stalinism?I know about a wolf and a bird and, you know,he ate the bird, and then in the end you hear, you know,you hear the bird squeaking, or something, you know?So I don't really know that. I don't really --actually I do my own kind of research, you know.If I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera, or something like that,I will do a lot of research, because it's interesting,not because it's what I'm supposed to do.I'm very, very, very inspired by movies.The color of movies and the way light makes the colors,light from behind the projection,or light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible.And anyway, roll this little clip, I'll just show you.I sit up at night and I watch moviesand I watch women in movies a lot.And I think about, you know, their roles,and about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at.Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time.Whether they're kind of glorified in this way,or whether they're kind of, you know, ironically glorified,or whether they're, you know, sort of denigrated, or ironically denigrated.I go back to color all the time.Color is something that motivates me a lot.It's rarely color that I find in nature,although, you know, juxtaposed next to artificial color,natural color is so beautiful.So that's what I do. I study color a lot.But for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anythingthat is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood?How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?I mean, that's just not possible, you know.And so that's what makes me lie awake at night, I guess, you know.I want to show you -- I'm also like a big --I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often,and that's another thing that motivates me a lot.People say, oh, do that. An astrologer tells me to do something.So I do it.(Laughter)When I was about 21, an astrologer told methat I was going to meet the man of my dreams,and that his name was going to be Eric, right?So, you know, for years I would go to barsand, sort of, anyone I met whose name was EricI was humping immediately, or something.(Laughter)And there were times when I was actually so desperateI would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, "Eric!"And anybody who would turn around I would, sort of, make a beeline for.(Laughter)And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago.The last card he pulled, which was representing my destinywas this guy on like a straw boater with a caneand you know, sort of spats and this, you know, a minstrel singer, right?I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thingwhere I do a cabaret act.So actually, check this out.Very embarrassing.(Video): Thank you. We can do anything you ask.The name of the show is based on this storythat I have to tell you about my mother.It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.I was dating this guy, right?And this has to do with being happy, I swear.I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year, right.And we were getting serious,so we decided to invite them all to dinner, our parents.And we, you know, sort of introduced them to each other.My mother was, sort of, very sensitive to his mother,who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing.You know, homosexuality, right?So my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said,"Are you kidding? They have the greatest life together.They eat out, they see shows."They eat out, they see shows.(Laughter)That's the name of the show, they eat out, they --that's on my tombstone when I die."He ate out, he saw shows," right?So in editing these clips, I didn't have the audacityto edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub.So you'll have to, like, go check it out and come see me or something.Because it's mortifying, and yet it feels ...I don't know how to put this.I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know.And at least, you know, in my case,because if I just do one thing all the time,I don't know, I get very, very bored. I bore very easily.And you know, I don't say that I do everything well,I just say that I do a lot of things, that's all.And I kind of try not to look back, you know.Except, I guess, that's what staying up every night is about.Like, looking back and thinking, what a fool you made of yourself, you know.But I guess that's okay. Right?Because if you do many thingsyou get to feel lousy about everything,and not just one, you know.You don't master feeling lousy about one thing.Yeah, exactly.I will show you this next thing,speaking of costumes for operas.I do work with different choreographers.I work with Twyla Tharp a lot,and I work with Mark Morris a lot,who is one of my best friends.And I designed three operas with him,and the most recent one, "King Arthur."I'd been very ingrained in the dance worldsince I was a teenager.I went to performing arts high school,where I was an actor.And many of my friends were ballet dancers.Again, I don't know where inspiration comes from.I don't know where it comes from.I started making puppets when I was a kid.Maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from, puppets, right.And then performing arts high school.There I was in high school,meeting dancers and acting.And somehow, from there, I got interested in design.I went to Parsons School of Designand then I began my career as a designer.I don't really think of myself as a designer,I don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer.And frankly, I don't really know what to call myself.I think of myself as a ... I don't know what I think of myself as.It's just that.(Laughter)But I must say, this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time,that is what -- I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer.You always have to be slightly bored with everything.And if you're not, you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything.(Laughter)But I am really a little bored with everything.I always say to my partner, Marisa Gardini, who books everything --she books everything and she makes everything happen.And she makes all the deals.And I always tell her that I find myselfwith a lot of time on the computer bridge program.Too much time on computer bridge, which is, you know, like that'sso ... somehow, like, about ten years agoI thought that the most unboring place in the worldwould be like a T.V. studio,like for a day show. Some kind of day talk show.Because it's all of these things that I loveall kind of in one place.And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing,and do another thing and talk about it, right?And so I had this T.V. show.And that was a very, very, very big part of my process.Actually, could you roll the clip, please?This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie.(Video) Isaac Mizrahi: We're back on the set.Hi there.Rosie O'Donnell: Hello, Ben.IM: Look how cute she looks with this, just a slick back.Man: Her grandmother says, "Delish!"IM: Ah, wow, delish. All right. So now where should I position myself?I want to stay out of the way.I don't want to be -- okay. Here we go.Do you get nervous, Ashleigh?Ashleigh: Doing what?ROD: Cutting hair.A: Cutting hair? Never, never.I don't think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous.IM: You look so cute already, by the way.ROD: You like it? All right.IM: Do you have a problem with looking cute? You want to look cute.ROD: Of course I want to look cute.IM: Just checking, because some people want to look, you know,aggressively ugly.ROD: No, not me, no.IM: You read about all these people who have a lot of moneyand they have kids and the kids always end up somehow, like,really messed up, you know what I mean?And there's got to be some way to do that, Rosie.Because just because if you're fabulously rich, and fabulously famous,does that mean you shouldn't have kids,because you know they're going to end up getting messed up?ROD: No, but it means that your priority has to betheir well-being first, I think.But you have to make the decision for yourself.My kids are seven, who the hell knows.They're going to be like 14 and in rehab.And they're going to be playing this clip:"I'm such a good mother."My God, this is the shortest I've ever had.IM: It looks good, yeah?A: I was going to ask you, has your hair ever been --ROD: No! It's all right -- go crazy.IM: I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here.A: Oh no, we're just staging,ROD: We're just staging it.IM: Are you freaking out? You look so cute.ROD: No, I love it. It's the new me.IM: Oh, it's so fabulous!ROD: Flock of Rosie. Wooo!IM: So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world, right.I mean, like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that.That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring.Actually, I read this great quote the other day, which was,"Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die."Right? And then I realized, that was on my website,and then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to meand I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview.I forgot that I said that. But it's really true.I want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye.I'll tell you that I cook a lot also. I love to cook.And I often look at things as though they're food.Like I say, oh, you know, would you serve a rotten chicken?Then how could you serve, you know, a beat up old dress or something.How could you show a beat up old dress?I always relate things to kitchen-ry.And so I think that's what it all boils down to.Everything boils down to that.So check this out.This is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world.It's, like, this website.It's got a lot of different things on it.It's a polymathematical website.We actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments.And it's kind of my favorite thing in the world.And it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows?And again, I don't say it's good, I just think it's not boring, right?And here is the last bit.(Video) IM: I have to tell you, I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time.Chef: Do you?IM: Yeah, but I can never find buttermilk, ever.Chef: Oh.IM: You can't find buttermilk at Citarella; you can't find buttermilk.Chef: You can't?IM: It's always low-fat buttermilk.Chef: No, but that's all it is.IM: Is that all it is?Chef: Oh, you don't know? Let me tell you something.Let me tell you something interesting.IM: You know what? Stop laughing. It's not funny.Just because I don't know that whole -- that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk.Sorry, what?Chef: Well, here's the deal. Let me tell you the deal.In the old days when they used to make butter,you know how you make butter?IM: Churns?Chef: For cream?IM: Yeah, exactly.Chef: So you take heavy, high-fat milk, which is cream,and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water.The liquid is actually that clear liquid.If you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream,it's actually buttermilk.And that's what it was in the early days.And that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things.Now, the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk.IM: Excuse me, I didn't know. All right?Chef: The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious.IM: Yeah, it is, exactly.So who would think that it was low-fat?Well, that's it. Thank you very much.Happy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it.Thanks. Bye.

I think the future of this planet depends on humans,not technology, and we already have the knowledge --we’re kind of at the endgame with knowledge.But we’re nowhere near the endgamewhen it comes to our perception.We still have one foot in the dark ages.And when you listen to some of the presentations here --and the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings --and then you contrast it with the factwe still call this planet, "Earth:" it’s pretty extraordinary --we have one foot in the dark ages.Just quickly: Aristotle, his thing was, "It’s not flat, stupid, it’s round."Galileo -- he had the Inquisition, so he had to be a little bit more polite --his was, "It’s not in the middle, you know."And Hawkes: "it’s not earth, stupid, it’s ocean."This is an ocean planet.T.S. Eliot really said it for me --and this should give you goose bumps:"we shall not cease from explorationand the end of our exploring shall be to returnwhere we started and know the place for the first time."And the next lines are, "Through the unknown remembered gate,where the last of earth discoveredis that which is the beginning."So I have one message.It seems to me that we’re all pointed in the wrong direction.For the rocketeers in the audience:I love what you’re doing, I admire the guts,I admire the courage -- but your rocketsare pointed in the wrong goddamn direction.(Laughter)And it’s all a question of perspective.Let me try and tell you --I don’t mean to insult you, but look,if I -- and I’m not doing this for realbecause it would be an insult,so I’m going to pretend, and it softens the blow --I’m going to tell you what you’re thinking.If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth,and I held up another square that was the root two square --so it’s 1.5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans;and I said, what is the relative value of these two things?Well, it’s the relative importance.You would say -- yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know this;water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land.But it’s a question of perception,and if that’s what you’re thinking,if that’s what you think I mean when I say,"This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'"If you think that that’s the relative importance,two to one, you’re wrong by a factor of ten.Now, you’re not as thick as two short planks,but you sound like it when you say "Earth,"because that demonstration, if I turned around this way --that earth plane would be as thin as paper.It’s a thin film, two-dimensional existence.The ocean representation would have a depth to it.And if you hefted those two thingsyou might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1.It turns out that something more than94 percent of life on earth is aquatic.That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority.The problem we have in believing thatis -- you just have to give up this notionthat this Earth was created for us.Because it’s a problem we have.If this is an ocean planetand we only have a small minority of this planet,it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks.Okay. Let me criticize this thing.I’m not talking about James Cameron --although I could, but I won’t.You really do have to go and see his latest film,"Aliens of the Deep." It’s incredible.It features two of these deep rovers,and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine.This, I think, represents one of the most beautifulclassic submersibles built.If you look at that sub, you’ll see a sphere.This is an acryclic sphere.It generates all of the buoyancy,all of the payload for the craft,and the batteries are down here hanging underneath,exactly like a balloon.This is the envelope, and this is the gondola, the payload.Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights.And this one actually carries two great manipulators.It actually is a very good working sub --that’s what it was designed for.The problem with it is --and the reason I will never build another one like it --is that this is a product of two-dimensional thinking.It’s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers;we take all our terrestrial hang-ups,all our constraints -- importantly,these two-dimensional constraints that we have,and they’re so constrained we don’t even understand it --and we take them underwater.You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat.A seat works in a two-dimensional world,where gravity blasts down on that seat, OK?And in a two-dimensional world,we do know about the third dimensionbut we don’t use it because to go uprequires an awful lot of energy against gravity.And then our mothers tell us,"Careful you don’t fall down" -- because you’ll fall over.Now, go into the real atmosphere of this planet.This planet has an inner atmosphere of water;it’s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres --a lesser, outer gaseous atmosphere, a lighter one.Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere.And that life enjoys a three-dimensional existence,which is alien to us.Fish do not sit in seats.(Laughter)They don’t. Their mothers don’t say to little baby fish,"Careful you don’t fall over."They don’t fall over. They don’t fall.They live in a three-dimensional worldwhere there is no difference in energybetween going this way, that way, that way or that way.It’s truly a three-dimensional space.And we’re only just beginning to grasp it.I don’t know of any other submersible,or even remote, that just takes advantagethat this is a three-dimensional space.This is the way we should be going into the oceans.This is a three-dimensional machine.What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals,and move in this three-dimensional space.OK, this is good stuff.This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater.Right now, I’m just coming down on this gorgeous, big, giant manta ray.She has twice the wingspan that I do.There I’m coming; she sees me.And just notice how she rolls under and turns;she doesn’t sit there and try and blow air into a tankand kind of flow up or sink down -- she just rolls.And the craft that I’m in --this hasn’t been shown before.Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before.I wanted you to noticethat she actually turned to come back up.There I am; I see her coming back,coming up underneath me.I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down.I’m trying to do everything very gently.We spent about three hours together and she’s beginning to trust me.And this ballet is controlled by this lady here.She gets about that close and then she pulls away.So now I try and go after her, but I’m practicing flying.This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype.This was a fly by wire. It has wings.There’re no silly buoyancy tanks --it’s permanently, positively buoyant.And then by moving through the waterit’s able to take that control.Now, look at that; look, it’s -- she just blew me away.She just rolled right away from underneath.Really that’s the only real dive I’ve ever made in this machine.It took 10 years to build.But this lady here taught me, hah, taught me so much.We just learned so much in three hours in the water there.I just had to go and build another machine.But look here. Instead of blowing tanksand coming up slowly without thinking about it,it’s a little bit of back pressure,and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water.This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you, Sony.I don’t really look that ugly,but the camera is so close that it’s just distorted.Now, there she goes, right overhead.This is a wide-angle camera.She’s just a few inches off the top of my head."Aah, ha, oh, he just crossed over the top of my head about,oh, I don’t know, just so close."I come back up, not for air."This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I’m speechless.We’ve been just feet apart. I’m going back down now."Okay, can we cut that? Lights back up please.(Applause)Trying to fly and keep up with that animal --it wasn’t the lack of maneuverability that we had.It was the fact she was going so slow.I actually designed that to move faster through the waterbecause I thought that was the thingthat we needed to do: to move fast and get range.But after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance.She wanted to dance.And so what we needed to do was increase the wing areaso that we just had more grip, develop higher forces.So the sub that was outside last year -- this is the one.You see the larger wing area here.Also, clearly, it was such a powerful thing,we wanted to try and bring other peoplebut we couldn't figure out how to do it.So we opened the world’s first flight school.The rational for the world’s first flight schoolgoes something like: when the coastguards come up to me and say --they used to leave us alone when we were divingthese goofy little spherical things,but when we started flying aroundin underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous --they would come up and say,"Do you have a license for that?"And then I’d put my sunglasses on, the beardthat would all sprout out, and I would say,"I don’t need no stinking license."(Laughter)"I write these stinking license," which I do.So Bob Gelfond's around here --but somebody in the audience here has license number 20.They’re one of the first subsea aviators.So we’ve run two flight schools.Where the hell that goes, I don’t know, but it’s a lot of fun.What comes next in 30 seconds? I can’t tell you.But the patent for underwater flight --Karen and I, we were looking at it,some business partners wanted us to patent it --we weren’t sure about that.We’ve decided we’re just going to let that go.It just seems wrong to try and patent --(Applause)-- the freedom for underwater flight.So anybody who wants to copy usand come and join us, go for it.The other thing is that we’ve got much lower costs.We developed some other technologycalled spider optics, and Craig Ventner asked meto make an announcement here this morning:we’re going to be building a beautiful, little,small version of this -- unmanned, super deep --for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff.(Applause)Thank you.

Zach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team.We investigate materials and technologiesthat have unexpected properties. Over the last three years,we found over 200 of these things, and so we lookedback into our library and selected six we thought would be mostsurprising for TED.Of these six, the first one that we're going to talk aboutis in the black envelope you're holding.It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up.Keith Schacht: Now be sure and take the two pieces apart.What's unexpected about this is that it's soft, but it's also a strong magnet.Zach and I have always been fascinatedobserving unexpected things like this.We spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized:it's when we see something unexpected,it changes our understanding of the way things work.As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time,if you assume that all magnets had to be hard,then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understandingof the way magnets could work.ZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are.But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible,we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.So, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material --if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise,and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.Imagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker.You know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of thosemetal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet,and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf.For me, I really love this idea.(Laughter)If you come to my apartment and see my closet,I'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.KS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple ofapplications -- it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is.But we've found that the way we present our ideasit makes a big difference.ZK: It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A.,and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola.He works on mostly music videos and commercialswith his company, The Directors Bureau.As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.And we were showing him the samegel magnet that you're holding in your hand -- and you know,we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face:Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder;he opens it up and Keith and I look in,and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.These things just get him really excited. And so we're lookingat these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approachwas totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now.When we were going in the car back to the airport,we were thinking: why was this so powerful?And as we thought about it more, we realized thatit let you fill in all the details about the experience,just as if you saw it on TV. So, for TED we decided to take our favoriteidea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his teamat the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a productfrom the future.Narrator: Do you have a need for speed?Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourselfon a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslideso fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.Aqua Rocket: coming this summer.KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this,and they asked us, when's it coming out?So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out,just the concept is.ZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for usto make sure that they work from a technical standpoint.So I just want to quickly explain how this would work.This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial.The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board.Now this is important for two reasons.One: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it wereto hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him.In addition, you can see from the diagram on the right,the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down.The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force,would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.When you get to the very bottom of the slide --(Laughter)-- the rider passes through an aluminum tube.And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's importantfrom a technical standpoint.KS: So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum isa metal, it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpectedhappens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.(Laughter)Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly.Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it,but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling,the greater the stopping force.ZK: Now, our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole,and I have it right here in my pocket.(Laughter)There're a few different versions of it.(Laughter)KS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one.They can be made to automatically roll up, or they can be madestable, like Zach's, to hold any position in between.ZK: As we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn abouthow you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently --he was telling us that, in the military they use this oneso soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed --and then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antennato clearly send signals back to the base.In our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal:so at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag.(Laughter)KS: Now, the interesting thing about this is,you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate whya 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.(Laughter)So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicagoand ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.Man: I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider websoff my house -- I do it that way.Woman: I'd make my very own walking stick.Woman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree.Woman: An olive server.Man: Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use.Woman: I would make a spear that, when you went deep sea diving,you could catch the fish really fast, and then roll it back up,and you could swim easier ... Yeah.(Laughter)ZK: Now, for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration,and so we need a volunteer from the audience.You sir, come on up.(Laughter)Come on up. Tell everybody your name.Steve Jurvetson: Steve.ZK: It's Steve. All right Steve, now, follow me.We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign.Right there. That's great.And hold onto this. Good luck to you.(Laughter)KS: No, not yet.(Laughter)ZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentationhas been brought to you by Target.KS: Little bit -- that's perfect, just perfect.Now, Zach, we're going to demonstratea water gun fight from the future.(Laughter)So here, come on up to the front. All right, sonow if you'll see here -- no, no, it's OK.So, describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead.SJ: It's cold.KS: Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loadedinto these squirt guns -- it's a dry liquid developed by 3M.It's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless.It's so safe you could drink this stuff.(Laughter)And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates25 times faster than water.(Laughter)All right, well thanks for coming up.(Laughter)ZK: Wait, wait, Steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquidso during the break you can shoot your friends.SJ: Excellent, thank you.KS: Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause.(Applause)So what's the significance of this dry liquid?Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.Now, the unexpected thing about thisis that Zach could stand up on stage and drencha perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concernthat we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet,that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non-conductive.So you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit boardin this and it wouldn't cause any damage.You can circulate it to draw the heat away.But today it's most widely used in office buildings --in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid.Again, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything.But our favorite idea for thiswas using it in a basketball game. So during halftime,it could rain down on the players, cool everyone down,and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court.ZK: Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japancalled Sekisui Chemical. One of their R&amp;D engineerswas working on a way to make plastic stiffer.While he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing.We have a video to show you.KS: So you see there, it didn't bounce back. Now, this wasan unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing.It's technically called, "shape-retaining property."Now, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil,and it holds its place. Contrast that witha plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sidesand it always bounces back.ZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist,but doesn't use a buckle.Taking it a little further, if you wovethose strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could makea shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth:so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table,so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.For our next technology, it's hard to observethe unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.So, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.KS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes.So with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent.Now, to think about the potential for this,think of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards,on the back of cereal boxes, board games. Any place you use ink,you could change the way you interact with it.ZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book.This could totally change the way that you interface with paper.You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pagesof the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on,based on the curvature of the pages.In addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could programthe book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.KS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his teamat the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the futureto explain how it works.Old Milk Carton: Oh yeah, it smells good.Who are you?New Milk Carton: I'm New Milk.OMC: I used to smell like you.Narrator: Fresh Watch, from Inventables Dairy Farms.Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off.Don't let milk spoil your morning.ZK: Now, this technology was developed by these two guys:Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois.KS: Now the way it works: there's a matrix of color dyes.And these dyes change color in response to odors.So the smell of vanilla, that might change the four on the left to brownand the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can producethousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells.But like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect,then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor.ZK: Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself,and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible,beyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies.His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn,how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene?And he kind of comically explained thattime after time, what the firemen would say is:they would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around;if there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go.(Laughter)I mean, this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries.(Laughter)But more seriously, they determined that you could developa device that can smell better than the humans,and say if it's safe for the firemen.In addition, he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing,where they're working on medical equipment.So, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device.By detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses,or even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can usesoftware to analyze the results.This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients.Currently, they're using a method of trial and error,but this could tell you precisely what disease you have.KS: So that was the six we had for you today, but I hope you're starting to seewhy we find these things so fascinating.Because every one of these six changed our understandingof what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this,we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket;something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent;every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more.ZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing.I'm sure it's obvious to you now, but it was actually yesterdaythat I was reminded of why. I was having a conversationwith Steve Jurvetson, over downstairs by the escalators,and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box,one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand --the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son.And you know, his son was mesmerized,because he would dunk it in the water, he would take it outand it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his sonwas playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticedthat there were some drops of water on the hair.And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said,"Look, hydrophobic string."(Laughter)I mean, after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me.Thank you very much.KS: Thank you.(Applause)

You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.And it comes in a male form, too --very glamorous.Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine,there actually is a little wine in there --and of course, always wears a tuxedo.But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning --one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,but also comes in other forms.A magazine?Well, it's certainly not this one.This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it's all about sex tips.Sex tips are not glamorous.And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm,is not glamorous either.But there is a glamour of industry.This is Margaret Bourke-White's --one of her pictures she did.Fantastic, glamorous picturesof steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.And there's the mythic glamourof the garage entrepreneur.This is the Hewlett-Packard garage.We know everyone who starts a business in a garageends up founding Hewlett-Packard.There's the glamour of physics.What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe,grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene --he has other kinds of glamour.And there is, of course, this glamour.This is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space --and not the alien-style glamour,but the nice, clean, early '60s version.So what do we mean by glamour?Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour meansis you can look in the dictionary.And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary,in this case the 1913 dictionary.Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning,and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.You had "a" glamour.It wasn't glamour as a quality -- you "cast a glamour."Glamour was a literal magic spell.Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today,but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsiesand to some extent, Celtic magic.And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century,it started to take on this other kind of deception --this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with,an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.But still, glamour is an illusion.Glamour is a magic spell.And there's something dangerous about glamourthroughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spellon you, it was not in your self-interest --it was to get you to act against your interest.Well of course, in the 20th century,glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.And this is Hedy Lamarr.Hedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous,all you have to do is sit there and look stupid." (Laughter)But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy --about whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it.There was a tremendous amount of technical achievementassociated with creating this Hollywood glamour.There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywoodand see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colorsdepending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.So you've got this highly stylized portrait of somethingthat was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star.And actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time --they call them false color.Glamour is a form of falsification,but falsification to achieve a particular purpose.It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.And it involves a great deal of technique.It's not -- glamour is not something --you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.There is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization,"and it's not just the case for people.Glamour doesn't have to be people.Architectural photography --Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration,took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.Architectural photography is extremely glamorous.It puts you into this special, special world.This is Alex Ross's comic book art,which appears to be extremely realistic,as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world.When you stack people in rows,the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground --but not in the world of glamour.What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurbin the table of contents of New York magazine,which was telling us that glamour is back --glamour is all about transcending the everyday.And I think that that's starting to get at what the corethat combines all sorts of glamour is.This is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.And I don't know who she is either,but this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.It's a very glamorous portrait.Why is it glamorous?It's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful --but that does not make you glamorous,that only makes you beautiful.She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent,and those are the central qualities of glamour.You don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.She's not looking away from you exactly,but you have to mentally imagine her world.She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher worldto which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquilwhile holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.Mel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" -- not glamorous.That's glamour:that's Michelangelo's "Pieta," where Mary is the same age as Jesusand they're both awfully happy and pleasant.Glamour invites us to live in a different world.It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant --that's why, often in these glamour shots,the person is not looking at the audience,it's why sunglasses are glamorous --but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.In some sense, there has to be something like us.So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent,omniscient -- too far above us.And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Marywill often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms.As I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people,but it has to have this transcendent quality.What is it about Superman?Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous,one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.Glamour is all about transcending this worldand getting to an idealized, perfect place.And this is one reason that modes of transportationtend to be extremely glamorous.The less experience we have with them,the more glamorous they are.So you can do a glamorized picture of a car,but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.The notion is that it's going to transport you,and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane,who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.The story is about where you're arriving,or thinking about where you're arriving.And this sense of being transportedis one reason that we have glamour styling.This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorousbecause we associate it with movies of that period, but because,in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.The same thing -- arches are very glamorous.Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous.I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorousbecause, to me, it captures the whole promiseof the academic contemplative life --but maybe that's because I went to Princeton.Anyway, skylines are super glamorous,city streets -- not so glamorous.You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.The horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.There are few things more glamorous than the horizon --except, possibly, multiple horizons.Of course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat --you just see the possibilities.In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance qualityof sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglionein his book, "The Book Of The Courtier."There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today,after a few centuries.And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art.It makes things look effortless.You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress --she just looks completely natural.And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies,how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.Of course, they covered that with make-up,because Lara Croft did all those same stunts --but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura."To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort":And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.Glamour is about editing.How do you create the sense of transcendence,the sense of evoking a perfect world?The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this --I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.We don't tell you all the grubby details.Now, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year.This is underneath Jeff's desk.This is what the real world of computers,lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.But if you look in a catalog --particularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home --it looks like this.There are no cords.Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail --you can usually figure out where they hid the cord.But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp,you will live in a world without cords. (Laughter)And the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptopor you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras,you don't get to live in the world without cords.You have to have mystery and you have to have grace.And there she is -- Grace.This is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.Part of the thing is that, in "Rear Window,"the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.Here's Hedy Lamarr again.And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorousbecause, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.Translucence is glamorous --that's why all these people wear pearls.It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent --not transparent, not opaque.It invites us into the worldbut it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person,maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot,because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.It has that sense of going up and away,and yet you never think about how you would really tripif you were -- particularly going down.And of course glass block has that sense of translucence.So, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasurebut glamour's really partly about meaning.All individuals and all cultures have idealsthat cannot possibly be realized in reality.They have contradictions,they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other --whatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purposeto our lives as cultures and as individuals.And the way we deal with that is we displace them --we put them into a golden world, an imagined world,an age of heroes, the world to come.And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.The white picket fence, the perfect house.The perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace,the perfect diamond ring.The perfect getaway in your perfect car.This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.The perfect office --again, no cords, as far as I can tell.And certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.I mean, there's no paper on the desk.We want this golden world.And some people get rich enough,and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense,they get to acquire their perfect world.Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is --I don't think accidentally -- in Art Deco style.That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.This is not always good, because what is your perfect world?What is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?Is it something important?"The Matrix" is a movie that is all about glamour.I could do a whole talk on "The Matrix" and glamour.It was criticized for glamorizing violence,because, look -- sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course,they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of thingsthat are impossible in the real world.This is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.This is from Soviet Union. Attractive.I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.You know, we're marching toward Utopia.I'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad.Because what they're doing is they're saying,your coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important.But actually, what's even more importantthan remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good?Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor.This is from "Triumph Of The Will" --brilliant editing to cut together things.There's a glamour shot.National Socialism is all about glamour.It was a very aesthetic ideology.It was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world,and ridding it of anything unglamorous.So glamour can be dangerous.I think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value.I'm not against glamour.But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamourand a way to broaden your appreciation of it.And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's adviceand confront the manipulation of it all,and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy,but also enjoy how it happens.And here's Hedy Lamarr.She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid,even though she thought she could look stupid.David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of thisvery glamorous painting is heightened if you think aboutthe fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash,which only took a fraction of a second to happen.There is a book out in the bookstore --it's called "Symphony In Steel,"and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.And that has a fascination.It's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal.There's a wonderful book called "Crowns"that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.And there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about,"As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats.They looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.But I also knew how hard they worked all week.Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow."And, actually, you get more appreciation for glamourwhen you realize what went into creating it.Thank you.

I grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in thevery, very north end of it there,where it's absolutely freezing cold.This was me running around in the back garden mid-summer.(Laughter)I couldn't pick a career.In Ireland the obvious choice is the military,but to be honest it actually kind of sucks.(Laughter)My mother wanted me to be a dentist.But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.So I actually went to school in Belfast,which was where all the action happened.And this was a pretty common sight.The school I went to was pretty boring.They forced us to learn things like Latin.The school teachers weren't having much fun,the sports were very dirty or very painful.So I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.And I was actually rowing for my school hereuntil this fateful day, and I flipped over right in frontof the entire school.And that was the finishing post right there.(Laughter)So this was extremely embarrassing.But our school at that time got a grant from the government,and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3DZ --and they left the programming manuals lying around.And so students like myself with nothing to do,we would learn how to program it.Also around this time, at home,this was the computer that people were buying.It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.Actually I'm just going to pause for one second,because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED --you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair.So I brought a picture with big hair.(Laughter).I just want to get that out of the way.So after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly namedSinclair ZX81.(Laughter)And -- you see the picture at the bottom?There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.That's what they thought they had built it for.The reality is we got the programming manualand we started making games for it.We were programming in BASIC,which is a pretty awful language for games,so we ended up learning Assembly languageso we could really take control of the hardware.This is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair,and he's showing his machine.You had this same thing in America,it was called the Timex Sinclair1000.To play a game in those days you had to have an imaginationto believe that you were really playing "Battlestar Galactica."The graphics were just horrible.You had to have an even better imagination to play this game,"Death Rider."But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves.They started making their own video games.This is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding,so males choose the lucky rabbit.It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K,which was quite the leap.And if you're wondering how much 16K is,this eBay logo here is 16K.And in that amount of memory someone programmeda full flight simulation program.And that's what it looked like.I spent ages flying this flight simulator,and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it.Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer.He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe.He's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he'ssmiling in this photograph.So I went on for the next 20 years or somaking a lot of different games.Some of the highlights were things like "The Terminator,""Aladdin," the "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles."Because I was from the United Kingdom,they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children,so they decided to call it hero instead.I personally preferred the Spanish version,which was "Tortugas Ninja."That was much better.(Laughter)Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industryand Hollywood to actually work together on something --instead of licensing from each other, to actually work.Now, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me,so I've done that.The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.It grows every year.Last year was the biggest year.By 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry.By 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion.43 percent of gamers are female.So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware.The average age of gamers?Well, obviously it's for children, right?Well, no, actually it's 30 years old.And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.So 37 is our target audience.All video games are violent.Of course the newspapers love to beat on this.But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever,so it's just not true.Online gaming statistics.I brought some stuff on "World of Warcraft." It's 5.5 million players.It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer,making the publisher about another 275 million.The game costs about 80 million dollars to make,so basically it pays for itself in about a month.A player in a game called "Project Entropia"actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars.You have to remember that this is not a real island.He didn't actually buy anything, just some data.But he got great terms on it.This purchase included mining and hunting rights,ownership of all land on the island, and a castlewith no furniture included.(Laughter)This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually.And what's interesting about it is the market was actually createdby the gamers themselves.They found clever ways to trade itemsand to sell their accounts to each otherso that they could make money while they were playing their games.I dove onto eBay a couple of days agojust to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items.I liked this one the best:a level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars.It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it.So as far as popularity of games,what do you think these people are doing here?It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeleslistening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music.That's what the show looks like.You would expect it to be cheesy, but it's not.It's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert.And the people that went there absolutely loved it.What do you think these people are doing?They're actually bringing their computers so they can play gamesagainst each other.And this is happening in every city around the world.This is happening in your local cities too,you're probably just not aware of it.Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years agohere just to show how video game graphics have been improving.I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.But what I want you to do is to try to understand it.We're on this curve, and the graphics are gettingso ridiculously better.And I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007.But I want you to try and think about what games could look like10 years from now.So we're going to start that video.Video: Throughout human history people have played games.As man's intellect and technology have evolvedso too have the games he plays.(Music)(Applause)David Perry: The thing again I want you to think about is,don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is.Think about that's where we are right now,and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continueto get better.This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to drawif you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today.You need to be really an incredible artist.And once we get enough of those guys, we're going to wantmore fantasy artists that can create placeswe've never been to before, or characters thatwe've just never seen before.So the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio.But if you were to go to a game developers conference,what they're all talking about is emotion, purpose,meaning, understanding and feeling.You'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.I came across a student who's absolutely excellentat expressing himself, and this student agreedthat he would not show his video to anybody untilyou here at TED had seen it.So I'd like to play this video.So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are.Video: I, like many of you, live somewhere betweenreality and video games.Some part of me -- a true living, breathing person --has become programmed, electronic and virtual.The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasyhas finally begun to crumble.I'm a video game addict and this is my story.(Music)In the year of my birththe Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development.I played in the backyard, learned to read,and even ate some of my vegetables.Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos.But as was the case for most of my generation,I spent a lot of time in front of the TV.Mr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior,and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedlyleft their mark on me.When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo,whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactiveelectronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me.At some point something clicked.(Music)With the combination of simple, interactive storiesand the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendobecame more than just an escape.It became an alternate existence, my virtual reality.(Music)I'm a video game addict, and it's not because ofa certain number of hours I have spent playing,or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level.It is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space,and video games had begun to erode my own understandingof what is real and what is not.I'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality,I still crave more.(Music)From an early age I learned to invest myself emotionallyin what unfolded before me on screen.Today, after 20 years of watching TV geared to make me emotional,even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes.I am just one of a new generation that is growing up.A generation who may experience much more meaningthrough video games than they will through the real world.Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap,a point where game worlds will look and feel just as realas the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV.And while my sense of free will in these virtual worldsmay still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life.Play enough video games and eventually you willreally believe you can snowboard, fly a plane,drive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.I know I can.Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it,video games actually allow us to become part of the machine.They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive,downloaded, streaming, HD reality.We are interacting with our entertainment.I have come to expect this level of interaction.Without it, the problems faced in the real world --poverty, war, disease and genocide -- lack the levity they should.Their importance blends into the sensationalized dramaof prime time TV.But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics,the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound.It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.I have fought in wars, feared for my own survival,watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feelmore real than any textbook or any news story.The people who create these games are smart.They know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad.Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.A well-designed video game will seamlesslyweave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience.As one becomes more experiencedthe awareness of physical control melts away.I know what I want and I do it.No buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.I know violent video games make my mother worry.What troubles me is not that video game violenceis becoming more and more like real life violence,but that real life violence is starting to look more and morelike a video game.(Music)These are all troubles outside of myself.I, however, have a problem very close to home.Something has happened to my brain.(Music)Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holdsall of our gut instincts, the things we know to dobefore we even think.While some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned,and all of them are hardwired into our brains.These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds.Only in recent years has the technology behind video gamesallowed for a true overlap in stimuli.As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physicsin the same cities and doing many of the same thingswe once did in real life, only virtually.Consider this --my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.In all my driving games, I've driven a total of 31,459 miles.To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game.The sensory cues are very similar.It's a funny feeling when you have spent more timedoing something on the TV than you have in real life.When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is,this is almost as beautiful as my games are.For my virtual worlds are perfect.More beautiful and rich than the real world around us.I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are,but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetitionon a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.Today I believe Big Brother would find much more successbrainwashing the masses with video gamesrather than just simply TVs.Video games are fun, engaging, and leave your braincompletely vulnerable to re-programming.But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad.Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other,or helps us to understand the problems we're all facingin the real world.There is a potential to do good as well.It is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirrorthe real world we live in, that game developers realizethat they have tremendous responsibilities before them.I'm not sure what the future of video games holdsfor our civilization.But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlapthere is a greater and greater potential for other peopleto feel the same way I do.What I have only recently come to realizeis that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotionit is the power to break down reality that is so fascinatingand addictive to me.I know that I am losing my grip.Part of me is just waiting to let go.I know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become,or how flat the real world may seem to us,that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching usand how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.(Applause)DP: Wow.(Applause)I found that video very, very thought provoking,and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.And what was interesting about it is the obvious choicefor me to talk about was graphics and audio.But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well.Video games give an awful lot of other things too,and that's why people get so addicted.The most important one being fun.The name of this track is "The Magic To Come."Who is that going to come from?Is it going to come from the best directors in the worldas we thought it probably would?I don't think so.I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up nowthat aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past.They're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created.The same with students or highly creative people,writers and people like that.As far as colleges go, there's about 350 colleges around the worldteaching video game courses.That means there's literally thousands of new ideas.Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.There's nothing worse than having to listen to someonetry and pitch you a really bad video game idea.(Laughter)Chris Anderson: You're off, you're off. That's it.He's out of time.DP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me.CA: Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though.(Laughter)DP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class.The school is closed; they're coming back at midnightbecause they want to pitch their video game ideas.I'm sitting at the front of the class,and they're actually pitching their ideas.So it's hard to get students to come back to class,but it is possible.This is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old.And I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experiencein the video game world?And as I've shown here, we have the audience.She's never going to know a world where you can't press a buttonand have millions of people ready to play.You know, we have the technology.She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren'tstunning and really immersive.And as the student video showed, we can impact and move.She's never going to know a world where video gamesaren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry.I just hope she likes video games.(Laughter)So, my closing thought.Games on the surface seem simple entertainment,but for those that like to look a little deeper,the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiersto creative minds that like to think big.Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED?Thank you.Chris Anderson: David Perry. That was awesome.

Good morning.My name is David Rose.from VCs through PowerPoint pitches.So I think it's safe to sayThere are obviously all kinds of things --what is the single most important thingthe VC is going to be investing in?Somebody? What?Audience: People!and make a lot of money in return.Now, how do you do this?You can't just walk up and say,most should be less than half an hour --Tests have shown.So in that 18 or 10 or five minutes,about 10 different characteristics,while you're standing up there.Audience: Integrity.DR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy!That's a straight line, look at that!And I didn't even prompt him.Right, integrity. The key thing.So the most important thing is integrity.What's the second most important thing?Let's see if you can get this one.Audience: Self-confidence.DR: Close enough. Passion.You've got to convey passion.If you're not passionate,if you're not passionate about it?in this package you're presenting to a VC.Experience: you've got to be able to say,"Hey, you know, I've done this before."doesn't have to be a business,Next: knowledge.If you tell meI don't want somebody who says,You've got to know your market, your area.to get a company going.if it's a technology business,Having done all that,what else do I want to know as a VC?I want to know that you have commitment.That you are going to be here to the end.Bad things happen.I don't want another "me too" product.But on top of that, I need realism,And before you get to change the world,bad things are going to take place;you have to deal with that.And you have to have rational projections.Finally, you're asking for my money --You need to be coachable.We've had a lot of experience.Think about your pitch as a timeline.It starts off, you walk in the door.They know nothing whatsoever about you.are emotional at some level.You can go up, you can go down, right?And it goes from beginning to end.You've got maybe 10 seconds --to get their attention.In my case, I've invested.It can be a story or an experience.within that first few seconds.Everything has to reinforce this.revving up to the very end,then you've got to -- boom! --knock them out of the park.before you leave.How do you do that?First of all, logical progression.or the heights are different.and what you're going to do.or basic items in your business.or there's outside validation.it can be people have done it before;says this makes sense.that's not believable.So it's got to be both.You have to recover from those.and the minute you tell me that,Anything I don't understand,will stop the flow of the presentation.And it's a very tricky path.So this all feeds in together.people who have done this before.and see how a presentation goes.Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows.OK, Steve Jobs.on a totally empty stage.What are you focusing on?What's good? Short. Short bullet points.Just give me the headline.And you know what?Basically, none.What do you do?Best of all, images. Just a simple image.That said, we only have a very short time,Just give me your company logo."We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market."That lets me know the context.Now that I know what you're selling,tell me how you make money on it.or for the actual product you're selling.Again, validation.But everybody has competition.I want to know how you're special.I know what your competition does --All this ties into the financial overview.Five is a bit much. Probably four.our revenues will do this and that.into which I'm investing.you're going to go to Tahiti, whatever.Two million? 100,000?What's the money in so far? Who invested?or angel investors, or more VCs before.This is that rocket going up.Hopefully everything has been positive.And I'm thinking, "This is really great!"And I look at the logo -- OK, good.Now, in the process of doing this,The screen is in front of me,so I couldn't even see if I wanted to.So how do I know what's going on?Well, I have a laptop in front of me.You're looking at me and at this.What am I looking at?You think that I'm looking at that?No, I'm looking, actually,so I can see what's going on.that they bought last summer,so: David's Top Five Presentation Tips.Number five: always use presenter mode,or Ovation, or presenter tools.Number four: always use remote control.If you follow my suggestions,but not good as a handout.It doesn't work.The screen should come up behind youAnd that is how to pitch to a VC.

Well, good morning.You know, the computer and television both recently turned 60,and today I'd like to talk about their relationship.Despite their middle age, if you've been following the themesof this conference or the entertainment industry,it's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other.So it's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television,or why the invention of the atomic bombunleashed forces that lead to the writers' strike.And it's not just what these are doing to each other,but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter.To get a sense of this,and it's been a theme we've talked about all week,I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners.I wrote on cards: "television," "radio," "MySpace," "Internet," "PC."And I said, just arrange these, from what's important to youand what's not, and then tell me why.Let's listen to what happens when they get to the portionof the discussion on television.(Video) Girl 1: Well, I think it's important but, like, not necessarybecause you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs.Peter Hirshberg: Which is more fun, Internet or TV?Girls: Internet.Girl 2: I think we -- the reasons, one of the reasons we put computer before TVis because nowadays, like, we have TV shows on the computer.(Girl 3: Oh, yeah.)Girl 2: And then you can download onto your iPod.PH: Would you like to be the president of a TV network?Girl 4: I wouldn't like it.Girl 2: That would be so stressful.Girl 5: No.PH: How come?Girl 5: Because they're going to lose all their money eventually.Girl 3: Like the stock market, it goes up and down and stuff.I think right now the computers will be at the topand everything will be kind of going down and stuff.PH: There's been an uneasy relationship between the TV businessand the tech business, really ever since they both turned about 30.We go through periods of enthrallment,followed by reactions in boardrooms, in the finance communitybest characterized as, what's the finance term? Ick pooey.Let me give you an example of this. The year is 1976,and Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise.The next year they march forward and they introduce Qube,the first interactive cable TV system,and the New York Times heralds thisas telecommunications moving to the home,convergence, great things are happening.Everybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures --Citicorp, Penney, RCA -- all getting into this big vision.By the way, this is about when I enter the picture.I'm going to do a summer internship at Time Warner.That summer I'm all -- I'm at Warner that summer --I'm all excited to work on convergence, and then the bottom falls out.Doesn't work out too well for them, they lose money.And I had a happy brush with convergenceuntil, kind of, Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing.That's when I leave graduate school, and I can't work in New Yorkon kind of entertainment and technologybecause I have to be exiled to California, where the remaining jobs are,almost to the sea, to go to work for Apple Computer.Warner, of course, writes off more than 400 million dollars.Four hundred million dollars, which was real money back in the '70s.But they were onto something and they got better at it.By the year 2000, the process was perfected. They merged with AOL,and in just four years, managed to shed about 200 billion dollarsof market capitalization, showing that they'd actually mastered the artof applying Moore's law of successive miniaturizationto their balance sheet.(Laughter)Now, I think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities,or the media community, is driven so crazy by the tech communityis that tech folks talk differently.You know, for 50 years, we've talked about changing the world,about total transformation.For 50 years, it's been about hopes and fearsand promises of a better world. And I got to thinking,you know, who else talks that way?And the answer is pretty clearly --it's people in religion and in politics.And so I realized that actually the tech world is best understood,not as a business cycle, but as a messianic movement.We promise something great, we evangelize it,we're going to change the world. It doesn't work out too well,and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again,as the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute, morbid astonishment.But it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing.So, what I'd like to ask is, if the computer is becoming a principal toolof media and entertainment, how did we get here?I mean, how did a machine that was built for accountingand artillery morph into media?Of course, the first computer was built just after World War IIto solve military problems, but things got really interestingjust a couple of years later -- 1949 with Whirlwind,built at MIT's Lincoln Lab. Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy,but you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in minda machine that might actually be a potential media star.So take a look at what happens when the foremost journalistof early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers,and the computer begins to express itself.(Video) Journalist: It's a Whirlwind electronic computer.With considerable trepidation,we undertake to interview this new machine.Jay Forrester: Hello New York, this is Cambridge.And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer.Would you like if I used the machine?Journalist: Yes, of course. But I have an idea, Mr. Forrester.Since this computer was madein conjunction with the Office of Naval Research,why don't we switch down to the Pentagon in Washingtonand let the Navy's research chief, Admiral Bolster,give Whirlwind the workout?Calvin Bolster: Well, Ed, this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket.This rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky.Now, at the standard rate of fuel consumption,I would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocketand see how it can determine, at any instant,say at the end of 40 seconds, the amount of fuel remaining,and the velocity at that set instant.JF: Over on the left-hand side,you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off.And on the right-hand side, there's a scalethat shows the rocket's velocity.The rocket's position is shown by the trajectorythat we're now looking at.And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory,the velocity, you will notice, has dropped off to a minimum.Then, as the rocket dives down, velocity picks up againtoward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground.How's that?Journalist: What about that, Admiral?CB: Looks very good to me.JF: And before leaving, we would like to show you another kind ofmathematical problem that some of the boys have worked outin their spare time, in a less serious vein, for a Sunday afternoon. (Music)Journalist: Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Forrester and the MIT lab.PH: You know, so much was worked out: the first real-time interaction,the video display, pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer,but unfortunately, it was too pricey for the Navy,and all of this would have been lostif it weren't for a happy coincidence.Enter the atomic bomb.We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever,and knowing a good thing when it sees it,the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us.They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system,deploy it all across the frozen north,and spend nearly three times as much on this computeras was spent on the Manhattan Projectbuilding the A-Bomb in the first place.Talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry.And you can imagine that the Air Force became a pretty good salesman.Here's their marketing video.(Video) Narrator: In a mass raid, high-speed bombers could be in on usbefore we could determine their tracks.And then it would be too late to act.We cannot afford to take that chance.It is to meet this threat that the Air Force has been developing SAGE,the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system,to strengthen our air defenses.This new computer, built to become the nerve center of a defense network,is able to perform all the complex mathematical problemsinvolved in countering a mass enemy raid.It is provided with its own powerhousecontaining large diesel-driven generators,air-conditioning equipment, and cooling towersrequired to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer.PH: You know, that one computer was huge.There's an interesting marketing lesson from it,which is basically, when you market a product,you can either say, this is going to be wonderful,it will make you feel better and enliven you.Or there's one other marketing proposition: if you don't use our product, you'll die.This is a really good example of that.This had the first pointing device. It was distributed,so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems --so all these things could talk to each other.About 20 percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing,and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes.You saw how huge it was, and to give you a sense for this --because we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things smallat this conference, so let's talk about making things large.If we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know,say, Century City, it would fit beautifully.You'd kind of have to take Century City out, but it could fit in there.But like, let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor,the latest Core 2 Extreme, which is a four-core processorthat Intel's working on, it will be our laptop tomorrow.To build that, what we'd do with Whirlwind technology iswe'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland,and from the 405 to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds.And then, the 92 nuclear power plantsthat it would take to provide the powerwould fill up the rest of Los Angeles.That's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France creates.So, the next time they tell you they're on to something, clearly they're not.So -- and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs.But it gives you the kind of power that people have, that the audience has,and the reasons these transformations are happening.All of this stuff starts moving into industry.DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer.It shows up at places like MIT, and then a mutation happens.Spacewar! is built, the first computer game, and all of a sudden,interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out.Actually, many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing,and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out.DEC knew a good thing about wasting time.It shipped every one of its computers with that game.Meanwhile, as all of this is happening, by the mid-'50s,the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinemahas been busted completely.A new technology has confounded radio men and movie mogulsand they're quite certain that television is about to do them in.In fact, despair is in the air.And a quote that sounds largely reminiscentfrom everything I've been reading all week.RCA had David Sarnoff, who basically commercialized radio,said this, "I don't say that radio networks must die.Every effort has been made and will continue to be madeto find a new pattern, new selling arrangementsand new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues.It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio,but I don't know how."And of course, as the computer industry develops interactively,producers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea.And they fake it.(Video) Jack Berry: Boys and girls, I think you all know how to get your magic windowsup on the set, you just get them out.First of all, get your Winky Dink kits out.Put out your Magic Window and your erasing glove, and rub it like this.That's the way we get some of the magic into it, boys and girls.Then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set,and rub it out from the center to the corners, like this.Make sure you keep your magic crayons handy, your Winky Dink crayonsand your erasing glove,because you'll be using them during the show to draw like that.You all set? OK, let's get right to the first story about Dusty Man.Come on into the secret lab.PH: It was the dawn of interactive TV, and you may have noticedthey wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits.Those are the Winky Dink crayons. I know what you're saying."Pete, I could use any ordinary open-source crayon,why do I have to buy theirs?"I assure you, that's not the case.Turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayonsyou should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window,other crayons may discolor or hurt the window.This proprietary principle of vendor lock-inwould go on to be perfected with great successas one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere.It led to lawsuits --(Laughter) --federal investigations, and lots of repercussions,and that's a scandal we won't discuss today.But we will discuss this scandal, because this man, Jack Berry, the host of "Winky Dink,"went on to become the host of "Twenty One," one of the most important quiz shows ever.And it was rigged, and it became unraveled when this man,Charles van Doren, was outed after an unnatural winning streak,ending Berry's career.And actually, ending the career of a lot of people at CBS.It turns out there was a lot to learnabout how this new medium worked.And 50 years ago, if you'd been at a meeting like thisand were trying to understand the media,there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from,Professor Marshall McLuhan.He actually understood something about a themethat we've been discussing all week. It's the role of the audiencein an era of pervasive electronic communications.Here he is talking from the 1960s.(Video) Marshall McLuhan: If the audience can become involved in the actual processof making the ad, then it's happy. It's like the old quiz shows.They were great TV because it gave the audience a role, something to do.They were horrified when they discoveredthey'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged.Now, then, this was a horrible misunderstanding of TVon the part of the programmers.PH: You know, McLuhan talked about the global village.If you substitute the word blogosphere, of the Internet today,it is very true that his understanding is probablyvery enlightening now. Let's listen in to him.(Video) MM: The global village is a worldin which you don't necessarily have harmony.You have extreme concern with everybody else's businessand much involvement in everybody else's life.It's a sort of Ann Landers' column writ large.And it doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet,but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs.And so the global village is as big as a planet,and as small as a village post office.PH: We'll talk a little bit more about him later.We're now right into the 1960s.It's the era of big business and data centers for computing.But all that was about to change.You know, the expression of technologyreflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in.And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations,it's not just a joke about messianism, it's actually what we do.But for this part of the story, I'd actually like to throw itto America's leading technology correspondent, John Markoff.(Video) John Markoff: Do you want to know what the counterculturein drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll and the anti-war movementhad to do with computing? Everything.It all happened within five miles of where I'm standing,at Stanford University, between 1960 and 1975.In the midst of revolution in the streetsand rock and roll concerts in the parks,a group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy,a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab,and Doug Engelbart, a computer scientist at SRI, changed the world.Engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture,but while he was beginning to do his work,all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula.There was LSD leaking out of Kesey's Veterans' Hospital experimentsand other areas around the campus,and there was music literally in the streets.The Grateful Dead was playing in the pizza parlors.People were leaving to go back to the land.There was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation.There was women's liberation.This was a remarkable place, at a remarkable time.And into that ferment came the microprocessor.I think it was that interaction that led to personal computing.They saw these tools that were controlled by the establishmentas ones that could actually be liberated and put to useby these communities that they were trying to build.And most importantly, they had this ethos of sharing information.I think these ideas are difficult to understand,because when you're trapped in one paradigm,the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense.The stories were so compelling that I decided to write a book about them.The title of the book is, "What the Dormouse Said:How the '60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry."The title was taken from the lyricsto a Jefferson Airplane song. The lyrics go,"Remember what the dormouse said.Feed your head, feed your head, feed your head." (Music)PH: By this time, computing had kind of leapt into media territory,and in short order much of what we're doing today was imaginedin Cambridge and Silicon Valley.Here's the Architecture Machine Group,the predecessor of the Media Lab, in 1981.Meanwhile, in California, we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff.HyperCard was the first programto introduce the public to hyperlinks,where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture,or piece of text, or data across a file system,and we had no way of explaining it.There was no metaphor. Was it a database?A prototyping tool? A scripted language?Heck, it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure.We asked a question about how the mind works,and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant.A few years later, we then hit on the ideaof explaining to people the secret of, how do you get the content you want,the way you want it and the easy way?Here's the Apple marketing video.(Video) James Burke: You'll be pleased to know, I'm sure, that there are several waysto create a HyperCard interactive video.The most involved method is to go aheadand produce your own videodiscas well as build your own HyperCard stacks.By far the simplest method is to buy a pre-made videodiscand HyperCard stacks from a commercial supplier.The method we illustrate in this videouses a pre-made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks.This method allows you to use existing videodisc materialsin ways which suit your specific needs and interests.PH: I hope you realize how subversive that is.That's like a Dick Cheney speech.You think he's a nice balding guy, but he's just declared waron the content business. Find the commercial stuff,mash it up, tell the story your way.Now, as long as we confine this to the education market,and a personal matter between the computer and the file system,that's fine, but as you can see, it was about to leap out and upset Jack Valentiand a lot of other people.By the way, speaking of the filing system, it never occurred to usthat these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network.A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee worked that out.It became a killer app of links, and today, of course,we call that the World Wide Web.Now, not only was I instrumental in helping Apple miss the Internet,but a couple of years later, I helped Bill Gates do the same thing.The year is 1993and he was working on a book and I was working on a videoto help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this.We were plenty aware that we were messing with media,and on the surface, it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things,but we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look.(Video) Narrator: The pyramids, the Colosseum, the New York subway systemand TV dinners, ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all.Yet each pales to insignificance with the completionof that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology,the Digital Superhighway.Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians.The Digital Highway arrived in America's living rooms late in the twentieth century.Let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible.The Digital Highway would follow the rutted trailfirst blazed by Alexander Graham Bell.Though some were incredulous ... Man 1: The phone company!Narrator: Stirred by the prospects of mass communicationand making big bucks on advertising,David Sarnoff commercializes radio.Man 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.Narrator: The medium introduced America to new products.Voice 1: Say, mom, Windows for Radio means more enjoymentand greater ease of use for the whole family.Be sure to enjoy Windows for Radio at home and at work.Narrator: In 1939, the Radio Corporation of America introduced television.Man 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.Narrator: Eventually, the race to the future took on added momentumwith the breakup of the telephone company.And further stimulus camewith the deregulation of the cable television industry,and the re-regulation of the cable television industry.Ted Turner: We did the work to build this, this cable industry,now the broadcasters want some of our money. I mean, it's ridiculous.Narrator: Computers, once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks,escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas.The world and all its culture reduced to bits,the lingua franca of all media.And the forces of convergence exploded.Finally, four great industrial sectors combined.Telecommunications, entertainment, computing and everything else.Man 3: We'll see channels for the gourmetand we'll see channels for the pet lover.Voice 2: Next on the gourmet pet channel,decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer.Narrator: All of industry was in play, as investors flocked to place their bets.At stake: the battle for you, the consumer,and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of America. (Music)PH: We missed a lot. You know, you missed, we missed the Internet,the long tail, the role of the audience, open systems, social networks.It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media.Thomas Edison had the same problem.He wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it,and kind of only one of his ideasturned out to have been the right early idea.Well, you know where we're going on from here.We come into the era of the dotcom, the World Wide Web,and I don't need to tell you about thatbecause we all went through that bubble together.But when we emerge from this and what we call Web 2.0,things actually are quite different.And I think it's the reason that TV's so challenged.If Internet one was about pages, now it's about people.It's a customer, it's an audience, it's a person who's participating.It's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now.(Video) MM: Because it gave the audience a role, something to do.PH: In my own company, Technorati,we see something like 67,000 blog posts an hour come in.That's about 2,700 fresh, connective linksacross about 112 million blogs that are out there.And it's no wonder that as we head into the writers' strike, odd things happen.You know, it reminds me of that old saw in Hollywood,that a producer is anyone who knows a writer.I now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem.But it's not a joke. This is a real headline."Websites attract striking writers:operators of sites like MyDamnChannel.comcould benefit from labor disputes."Meanwhile, you have the TV bloggers going out on strike,in sympathy with the television writers.And then you have TV Guide, a Fox property,which is about to sponsor the online video awards --but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television,not appearing to gloat.To show you how schizophrenic this all is,here's the head of MySpace, or Fox Interactive, a News Corp company,being asked, well, with the writers' strike,isn't this going to hurt News Corp and help you online?(Video) Man: But I, yeah, I think there's an opportunity. As the strike continues,there's an opportunity for more people to experiencevideo on places like MySpace TV.PH: Oh, but then he remembers he works for Rupert Murdoch.(Video) Man: Yes, well, first, you know, I'm part of News Corporationas part of Fox Entertainment Group.Obviously, we hope that the strike is --that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible.PH: One of the great things that's going on here isthe globalization of content really is happening.Here is a clip from a video, from a piece of animationthat was written by a writer in Hollywood,animation worked out in Israel, farmed out to Croatia and India,and it's now an international series.(Video) Narrator: The following takes place between the minutes of 2:15 p.m. and 2:18 p.m.,in the months preceding the presidential primaries.Voice 1: You'll have to stay here in the safe houseuntil we get word the terrorist threat is over.Voice 2: You mean we'll have to live here, together?Voices 2, 3 and 4: With her?Voice 2: Well, there goes the neighborhood.PH: The company that created this, Aniboom, is an interesting exampleof where this is headed. Traditional TV animation costs, say,between 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute.They're producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute.And they're offering their creators 30 percent of the back end,in a much more entrepreneurial manner. So, it's a different model.What the entertainment business is struggling with,the world of brands is figuring out.For example, Nike now understands that Nike Plus is not just a device in its shoe,it's a network to hook its customers together.And the head of marketing at Nike says, "People are coming to our sitean average of three times a week. We don't have to go to them."Which means television advertising is down 57 percent for Nike.Or, as Nike's head of marketing says,"We're not in the business of keeping media companies alive.We're in the business of connecting with consumers."And media companies realize the audience is important also.Here's a man announcing the new Market Watch from Dow Jones,powered 100 percent by the user experience on the home page --user-generated content married up with traditional content.It turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them.Or, as Geoffrey Moore once told me,it's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands needin the age of the blogosphere.And I think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business.One of my heroes is songwriter, Ally Willis,who just wrote "The Color Purple" and has been an R and --rhythm and blues writer, and this is what she saidabout where songwriting's going.Ally Willis: Where millions of collaborators wanted the song,because to look at them strictly as spamis missing what this medium is about.PH: So, to wrap up, I'd love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan,who, 40 years ago, was dealing with audiencesthat were going through just as much change,and I think that, today, traditional Hollywood and the writersare framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before.But I don't need to tell you this, let's throw it back to him.(Video) Narrator: We are in the middle of a tremendous clash between the old and the new.MM: The medium does things to peopleand they are always completely unaware of this.They don't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up.They think of the old medium,because the old medium is always the content of the new medium,as movies tend to be the content of TV,and as books used to be the content,novels used to be the content of movies.And so every time a new medium arrives,the old medium is the content, and it is highly observable,highly noticeable, but the real, real roughing up and massagingis done by the new medium, and it is ignored.PH: I think it's a great time of enthrallment.There's been more raw DNA of communications and mediathrown out there. Content is moving from shows to particlesthat are batted back and forth, and part of social communications,and I think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity.And whereas television may have gotten beat up,what's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication,and we kind of have the merger of the two industriesand a new way of thinking to look at it.Thanks very much.

My mission in life since I was a kid was,and is, to take the rest of you into space.It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth,take the people of Earth and transition off, permanently. And that's exciting.In fact, I think it is a moral imperativethat we open the space frontier.You know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chanceto have planetary redundancy,a chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere.And if you think about space,everything we hold of value on this planet --metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space.In fact, the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources.The analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska.We Americans bought Alaska in the 1850s. It's called Seward's folly.We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill.And then we discovered these things -- gold and oil and fishing and timber --and it became, you know, a trillion-dollar economy,and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space.We are on the verge of the greatest explorationthat the human race has ever known.We explore for three reasons,the weakest of which is curiosity.You know, it's funded NASA's budget up until now.Some images from Mars, 1997.In fact, I think in the next decade, without any question,we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitousunder the soils and different parts of that planet.The stronger motivator, the much stronger motivator, is fear.It drove us to the moon. We -- literally in fear -- with the Soviet Unionraced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks,you know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there,and while the probability is very small,the impact, figured in literally,of one of these hitting the Earth is so hugethat to spend a small fraction looking, searching,preparing to defend, is not unreasonable.And of course, the third motivator,one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth.In fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids,there's a class of the nickel iron,which in platinum-group metal markets aloneare worth something like 20 trillion dollars,if you can go out and grab one of these rocks.My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market,and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one.And that will fund the actual mission to go and get one.But fear, curiosity and greed have driven us.And for me, this is -- I'm the short kid on the right.This was -- my motivation was actually during Apollo.And Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever.If you think about what happened at the turn of -- early 1960s,on May 25, JFK said, "We're going to go to the moon."And people left their jobs and they went to obscure locationsto go and be part of this amazing mission.And we knew nothing about going to space.We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flightto going to the moon in eight years,and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old.They didn't know what couldn't be done.They had to make up everything.And that, my friend, is amazing motivation.This is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying,"If I can go to the moon" -- this is the last human on the moon so far --"nothing, nothing is impossible." But of course,we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.But I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there.The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier.The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch.That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable.We shouldn't be happy in standing for that.One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZEwas take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know.As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier,we should be allowed to risk.In fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know,just needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward,in fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us.The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals,and clearly the industrial-military complex --with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA -- are the dinosaurs.The ability for us to access these resourcesto gain planetary redundancy --we can now gather all the information, the genetic codes,you know, everything stored on our databases,and back them up off the planet,in case there would be one of those disastrous situations.The difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key.Once you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere --the moon, to Mars. And today,there's only three vehicles -- the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuzand the Chinese vehicle -- that gets you there.Arguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle.One of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket.We've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuzto go up to the space station for 20 million dollars.But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is --(Laughter) --it is expensive. But people are willing to pay that!You know, one -- we have a very unique period in time today.For the first time ever, we have enough wealthconcentrated in the hands of few individualsand the technology accessiblethat will allow us to really drive space exploration.But how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point.We know -- 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket,but how cheap could it get?Let's go back to high school physics here.If you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh,to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles,and then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour --remember, that one half MV squared -- and you figure it out.It's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy.If you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts.If you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources,and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour --anybody here fast in math?How much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit?100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that --we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way,I'll grant you that.(Laughter)But guys, if history has taught us anything,it's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually.I have no question that the physics,the engineering to get us down to the pointwhere all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner.The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment.Today, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollarof their own money in R&amp;D.It's all government research dollars, and very few of those.And in fact, the large corporations,the governments, can't take the risk.So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space.Today's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market?12 to 15 launches per year.Number of commercial companies out there? 12 to 15 companies.One per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace,and I call them self-loading carbon payloads.They come with their own money. They're easy to make.It's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution,reading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there.We offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship,carry three people up to 100 kilometers,come back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again.Twenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition,spending between one to 25 million dollars each.And of course, we had beautiful SpaceShipOne,which made those two flights and won the competition.And I'd like to take you there, to that morning,for just a quick video.(Video) Pilot: Release our fire.Richard Searfoss: Good luck.(Applause)RS: We've got an altitude call of 368,000 feet.(Applause)RS: So in my official capacity as the chief judgeof the Ansari X PRIZE competition,I declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventureshas indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE.(Applause)Peter Diamandis: Probably the most difficult thing that I had to dowas raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible.We went -- I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs.No one believed it was done. Everyone said, "Oh, what does NASA think?Well, people are going to die,how can you possibly going to put this forward?"I found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car,and raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industryand buying a hole-in-one insurance policy.See, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed,and said, "Are you going to compete?" No."Are you going to compete?" No. "No one's going to win this thing."So, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05,and I took a bet that someone would win.(Applause)So -- and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce.(Laughter)We've had a lot of accomplishmentsand it's been a tremendous success.One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOneis going to hang in Air and Space Museum,next to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer.Isn't that great? (Applause)So a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you.Today, you can go and experience weightless flights.By '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin,is going to be about 200,000.There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly,I think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight.Orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station.And then I truly believe, once a group is in orbit around the Earth --I know if they don't do it, I am --we're going to stockpile some fuel,make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate.(Laughter)Quick moment for the designers in the audience.We spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights.Here are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutanand my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity --people think a zero gravity room,there's a switch on there that turns it off --but it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane.And turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month.If we can get the audio up?(Video) Narrator: For a chance to win the first free ticket to space,look for specially marked packages of Diet 7-Up.When you want the taste that won't weigh you down,the only way to go is up.PD: That was filmed inside our airplane, and so, you can now do this.We're based down in Florida.Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about.The future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea.I had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prizeand the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward.And we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundationto actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas,and we just took on a new mission statement:"to bring about radical breakthroughs in spaceand other technologies for the benefit of humanity."And this is something that we're very excited about.I showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board.And you know, when you give to a nonprofit,you might have 50 cents on the dollar.If you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one.If you put up a prize, you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars.And that's huge. And then he turned around and said,"Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one."I said, "Well, that's great."So, we have actually -- are looking to turn the X PRIZEinto a world-class prize institute.This is what happens when you put up a prize,when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.You get publicity increase, and when it's won,publicity shoots through the roof -- if it's properly managed --and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor.Then, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving,you get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability.And the benefit to the sponsorsis the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term.That's our value proposition in a prize.If you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne,or any kind of a new technology,you have to fund that from the beginningand maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome.It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize,the beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee,and you pay on success.Orteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across --tried to go across the Atlantic,and we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE.So, prizes work great.You know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there,you know that when you're going for a goal,the first thing you have to do is believethat you can do it yourself.Then, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridiculeof -- that's a crazy idea, it'll never work.And then you have to convince others,so that they can, in fact, help you raise the funds,and then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucraciesand institutions that don't want you to move those things forward,and you have to deal with failures. What a prize does,what we've experienced a prize doing,is literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things,because a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea.Well, it must be a good idea.Someone's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing.And each of these areas was something that we foundthe Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation.So, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery processof how to come up with prizes and write the rules,and we're actually looking at creating prizesin a number of different categories.We're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology --and I'll talk about those more in a moment.And the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teamswithin the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team.We're going after an orbital prize.We are looking at a number of energy prizes.Craig Venter has just joined our boardand we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him,we'll be announcing later this fall,about -- imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNAfor under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine.And clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship.So my final slide here is, the most critical toolfor solving humanity's grand challenges -- it isn't technology,it isn't money, it's only one thing --it's the committed, passionate human mind.(Applause)

To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin.(Laughter)You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.And you're on the outside, you're at home.You're like the Raspyni Brothers,where you've got your balls in cold water. And --(Laughter) --you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited.And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be.It's exciting and there's music playing all of the timeand then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes.And you want to go back and do it again.But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris,and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible.So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit,within the subject of creation and optimism.And if you put creation and optimism together,you've got two choices that you can talk about.You can talk about creationism --which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience,at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it --or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z.And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.But any kind of conversation about architecture --which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here,setting up TED, small-scale architecture --at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this,the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.Because if architecture is what I believe it to be,which is the built form of our cultural ambitions,what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situationthat represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?And our own opportunity to make something new there?This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way,brought architecture into focusin a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time,and made it a subject for common conversation.I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture,a time when five people sat me down at a tableand asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting,safety concerns and whether carpet burns.These are just not things we talked about very often.And yet, now, it's talked about all the time.At the point where you can weaponize your buildings,you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way.And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way,we're going to think about it like this.How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that.There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.They've made a selection.They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,and now to an even larger instrument,upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,as you see here.He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,after six previous firms struck outwith things that were so stupid and banalthat even the city of New York was forced to go,"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up."Right. Can we do this again from the top,except use some people with a vague hint of talent,instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.Let's bring in some real architects for a change.And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.(Laughter)It's too late. That is gone.This was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destructionby making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.But that's what we're going to do.But I want you to think about these thingsin terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,and that these two things talk about very specifically.And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,in trying to decide whether we want architecturefrom the kind of technocratic solution to everything --that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,be they social, be they physical, be they chemical --or something that's more of a romantic solution.Now, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date.I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.So, in the American tradition,the difference between the technocratic and the romantic,would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson'sCartesian grids spreading across the United States,that gives us basically the whole shapeof every western state in the United States,as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the --in Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism.Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.Now, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?Manifest destiny.(Laughter)It's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important,it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved onethe moment they saw one.And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.(Laughter)Why? Why? Why do you want to do that?Why do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.(Laughter)It's in our nature to go ricochetingback and forth between this technocratic solutionand a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.So we're going to go straight into this.Can I have the lights off for a moment?I'm going to talk about two architects very, very brieflythat represent the current split, architecturally,between these two traditions of a technocraticor technological solution and a romantic solution.And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.One very young, one a little more mature.This is the work of a firm called SHoP,and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawingsof what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.Does everybody know what a camera obscura is?Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lensesthat takes a picture of the outside world --it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts --and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.This is just the outline of it, and you can see,does it look like a regular building? No.It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down,square, rectangular, anything like that,that you'd see in a normal shape of a building.The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.What's interesting about it is not the shape.What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made.A brand-new way to put buildings together,something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again.That's why we all live in developer houses.They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.That's because it's cheaper.Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer,a program that says, manufacture these parts.The computer then talks to a machine --a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine --that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice,because the computer is just a machine.It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.It's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe,so the parts can all be cut at the same time.Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life,what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,like you used to get when you were a child,when you bought little models that said, "Bolt A to B, and C to D."And so what the builder will get is every single individual partthat has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truckto the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.Just simple "Bolt A to B" and they will be able to put them together.Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works --and that's what will happen in the end.You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,these same architects were asked to produce somethingfor the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,as part of their young architects summer series.And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?In the summer, you go to the beach.And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,and that computer program shaped a sand duneand then took that sand dune shape and turned it into --at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications --a set of instructions for pieces of wood.And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.What you can see is there's about six different colors,and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,and there it is fully built.There are only 16 different pieces of wood,only 16 different assembly parts here.Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas,where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations,this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,that very important pedestrian connectionbetween the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,building it, including all of the parts, manufactured.And they were able to do it. That was their design,using that same computer modeling systemand only five or six really different kinds of parts,a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding materialand a very simple framing systemthat was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.They were able to create that.They were able to create something wonderful.They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,using the same technology.Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night.It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting,so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.Here it is going across. And there, down the other side,and you get the same kind of grandeur.Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may.Woo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,whose work you can see out here today.The current king of the romantics, who approaches his workin a very different fashion.It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce youinto something that you can do, into something that will please you,something that will lift your spirits,something that will make you feel as if are in another world --such as his Nobu restaurant in New York,which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York Cityto the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition."When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed," said the owner.Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.Every single surface of this restaurant is white.The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming.Watch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen.This is happening by itself.It transforms through the magic of lighting.It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco,up on the Upper West Side,with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that.Let's see it one more time.Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel goodin places that you wouldn't have felt good before.It's about bringing nature to the inside.In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --I'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the worldto make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden spaceof the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.It's about stimulation.This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines,all explained to you by color and texture on the wall.And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquartersfor the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida,where you're asked to enter the Greek theater,look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.And I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much.

The decorative use of wire in southern Africadates back hundreds of years.But modernization actually brought communicationand a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materialsstarted to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.So, here you can see the changefrom use -- starting to use contemporary materials.These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art formsled me to a new form,which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.And I got the opportunity to start working with this communityat that point, and started developing, really,and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide,so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us,and not only to supply the materials on bobbins,but to produce to our color specifications.At the same time, I was thinking, well,there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products,away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range --that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor marketthat could be exported and also service our local market.We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes,forms. The scale became very important,and it's become our pet project. It's successful,it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops,and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.This is our group, our main group of weavers.They come on a weekly basis to Durban.They all have bank accounts.They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.It's a weekly turnaround of production.This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.And that's also modernized today,and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.And the rest says it all.Thank you very much.(Applause)

How do groups get anything done? Right?How do you organize a group of individualsso that the output of the groupis something coherent and of lasting value,instead of just being chaos?And the economic framing of that problemis called coordination costs.And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financialor institutional difficulties in arranging group output.And we've had a classic answer for coordination costs,which is, if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people,you start an institution, right? You raise some resources.You found something. It can be private or public.It can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small.But you get these resources together.You found an institution, and you use the institutionto coordinate the activities of the group.More recently, because the cost of letting groupscommunicate with each other has fallen through the floor --and communication costs are one of the biginputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer,which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure,to design systems that coordinate the outputof the group as a by-product of the operating of the system,without regard to institutional models.So, that's what I want to talk about today.I'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples,but always pointing to the broader themes.So, I'm going to start by trying to answer a questionthat I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other,and which the Internet is purpose-built to answer,which is, where can I get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid?So, in New York City, on the first Saturday of every summer,Coney Island, our local, charmingly run-down amusement park,hosts the Mermaid Parade. It's an amateur parade;people come from all over the city; people get all dressed up.Some people get less dressed up.Young and old, dancing in the streets.Colorful characters, and a good time is had by all.And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself,charming though it is, but rather to these photos.I didn't take them. How did I get them?And the answer is: I got them from Flickr.Flickr is a photo-sharing servicethat allows people to take photos, upload them,share them over the Web and so forth.Recently, Flickr has added an additional function called tagging.Tagging was pioneered by Delicious and Joshua Schachter.Delicious is a social bookmarking service.Tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification.Right? If I had given this talk last year,I couldn't do what I just did,because I couldn't have found those photos.But instead of saying,we need to hire a professional class of librariansto organize these photos once they're uploaded,Flickr simply turned over to the usersthe ability to characterize the photos.So, I was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged"Mermaid Parade." There were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers,all aggregated and then put under this nice, neat name,shown in reverse chronological order.And I was then able to go and retrieve themto give you that little slideshow.Now, what hard problem is being solved here?And it's -- in the most schematic possible view,it's a coordination problem, right?There are a large number of people on the Internet,a very small fraction of them have photos of the Mermaid Parade.How do we get those people together to contribute that work?The classic answer is to form an institution, right?To draw those people into some prearranged structurethat has explicit goals.And I want to call your attention tosome of the side effects of going the institutional route.First of all, when you form an institution,you take on a management problem, right?No good just hiring employees,you also have to hire other employees to manage those employeesand to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth.Secondly, you have to bring structure into place.Right? You have to have economic structure.You have to have legal structure.You have to have physical structure.And that creates additional costs.Third, forming an institution is inherently exclusionary.You notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo.You can't hire everyone in a company, right?You can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization.You have to exclude some people.And fourth, as a result of that exclusion,you end up with a professional class. Look at the change here.We've gone from people with photos to photographers.Right? We've created a professional class of photographerswhose goal is to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade,or whatever else they're sent out to photograph.When you build cooperation into the infrastructure,which is the Flickr answer,you can leave the people where they areand you take the problem to the individuals, rather thanmoving the individuals to the problem.You arrange the coordination in the group, and by doing thatyou get the same outcome, without the institutional difficulties.You lose the institutional imperative.You lose the right to shape people's work when it's volunteer effort,but you also shed the institutional cost,which gives you greater flexibility.What Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination.And this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems.Right. You'll have experienced this in your lifewhenever you bought your first mobile phone,and you stopped making plans.You just said, "I'll call you when I get there.""Call me when you get off work." Right?That is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with planning.Right. We're now able to do that kind of thing with groups.To say instead of, we must make an advance plan,we must have a five-year projectionof where the Wikipedia is going to be, or whatever,you can just say, let's coordinate the group effort,and let's deal with it as we go,because we're now well-enough coordinatedthat we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do.So here's another example. This one's somewhat more somber.These are photos on Flickr tagged "Iraq."And everything that was hard about the coordination costwith the Mermaid Parade is even harder here.There are more pictures. There are more photographers.It's taken over a wider geographic area.The photos are spread out over a longer period of time.And worst of all, that figure at the bottom,approximately ten photos per photographer, is a lie.It's mathematically true,but it doesn't really talk about anything important --because in these systems, the average isn't really what matters.What matters is this.This is a graph of photographs tagged Iraqas taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5,445 photos.And it's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer.You can see here, over at the end,our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos,and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos.Then there's dozens of people who've taken dozens of photos.And by the time we get around here,we get ten or fewer photos, and then there's this long, flat tail.And by the time you get to the middle,you've got hundreds of peoplewho have contributed only one photo each.This is called a power-law distribution.It appears often in unconstrained social systemswhere people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like --this is often what you get. Right?The math behind the power-law distribution is that whatever's in the nth positionis doing about one-nth of whatever's being measured,relative to the person in the first position.So, we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographerto have contributed about a tenth of the photos,and the hundredth most prolific photographerto have contributed only about a hundred as many photosas the most prolific photographer did.So, the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter.But that basic math accounts both for the steep slopeand for the long, flat tail.And curiously, in these systems, as they grow larger,the systems don't converge; they diverge more.In bigger systems, the head gets biggerand the tail gets longer, so the imbalance increases.You can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted. Here's how heavily:if you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system,they account for three quarters of the photos taken --just the top 10 percent most prolific photographers.If you go down to five percent,you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos.If you go down to one percent, exclude 99 percent of the group effort,you're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos.And because of this left weighting,the average is actually here, way to the left.And that sounds strange to our ears,but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributorshave contributed a below-average amount.That sounds strange because we expect average and middleto be about the same, but they're not at all.This is the math underlying the 80/20 rule. Right?Whenever you hear anybody talking about the 80/20 rule,this is what's going on. Right?20 percent of the merchandise accounts for 80 percent of the revenue,20 percent of the users use 80 percent of the resources --this is the shape people are talking about when that happens.Institutions only have two tools: carrots and sticks.And the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone.The costs of running the institution mean that you cannottake on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame.The institutional model always pushes leftwards,treating these people as employees.The institutional response is,I can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great,that's what I'll do.The cooperative infrastructure model says,why do you want to give up a quarter of the value?If your system is designedso that you have to give up a quarter of the value,re-engineer the system.Don't take on the cost that prevents youfrom getting to the contributions of these people.Build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount.So the coordination response asks not,how are these people as employees, but rather,what is their contribution like? Right?We have over here Psycho Milt, a Flickr user,who has contributed one, and only one, photo titled "Iraq."And here's the photo. Right. Labeled, "Bad Day at Work."Right? So the question is,do you want that photo? Yes or no.The question is not, is Psycho Milt a good employee?And the tension here is between institution as enablerand institution as obstacle.When you're dealing with the left-hand edgeof one of these distributions,when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of timeproducing a lot of the material you want,that's an institution-as-enabler world.You can hire those people as employees, you can coordinate their workand you can get some output.But when you're down here, where the Psycho Milts of the worldare adding one photo at a time,that's institution as obstacle.Institutions hate being told they're obstacles.One of the first things that happenswhen you institutionalize a problemis that the first goal of the institutionimmediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal wasto self-preservation.And the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n.Right? So, when institutions are told they are obstacles,and that there are other ways of coordinating the value,they go through something a little bit like the Kubler-Ross stages --(Laughter)-- of reaction, being told you have a fatal illness:denial, anger, bargaining, acceptance.Most of the cooperative systems we've seenhaven't been around long enoughto have gotten to the acceptance phase.Many, many institutions are still in denial,but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining.There's a wonderful, small example going on right now.In France, a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool,right, because the fact that they have coordinatedthemselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue.You can follow this in the Guardian.It's actually quite entertaining.The bigger question is,what do you do about the value down here?Right? How do you capture that?And institutions, as I've said, are prevented from capturing that.Steve Ballmer, now CEO of Microsoft,was criticizing Linux a couple of years ago, and he said,"Oh, this business of thousands of programmerscontributing to Linux, this is a myth.We've looked at who's contributed to Linux,and most of the patches have been produced by programmerswho've only done one thing." Right?You can hear this distribution under that complaint.And you can see why, from Ballmer's point of view,that's a bad idea, right?We hired this programmer, he came in, he drank our Cokesand played Foosball for three years and he had one idea.(Laughter)Right? Bad hire. Right?(Laughter)The Psycho Milt question is, was it a good idea?What if it was a security patch?What if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit,of which Windows has not some, [but] several?Do you want that patch, right?The fact that a single programmer can,without having to move into a professional relationto an institution, improve Linux onceand never be seen from again, should terrify Ballmer.Because this kind of value is unreachable in classicinstitutional frameworks, but is part of cooperativesystems of open-source software, of file sharing,of the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr,but there are actually stories about this from all over.Meetup, a service founded so that users could find peoplein their local area who share their interests and affinitiesand actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafeor a pub or what have you.When Scott Heiferman founded Meetup,he thought it would be used for, you know,train spotters and cat fanciers -- classic affinity groups.The inventors don't know what the invention is.Number one group on Meetup right now,most chapters in most cities with most members, most active?Stay-at-home moms. Right?In the suburbanized, dual-income United States,stay-at-home moms are actually missingthe social infrastructure that comes from extended familyand local, small-scale neighborhoods.So they're reinventing it, using these tools.Meetup is the platform,but the value here is in social infrastructure.If you want to know what technology is going to change the world,don't pay attention to 13-year-old boys --pay attention to young mothers,because they have got not an ounce of support for technologythat doesn't materially make their lives better.This is so much more important than Xbox,but it's a lot less glitzy.I think this is a revolution.I think that this is a really profound changein the way human affairs are arranged.And I use that word advisedly.It's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium.It's a whole new way of doing things, which includes new downsides.In the United States right now, a woman named Judith Milleris in jail for not having given to a Federal Grand Jury her sources --she's a reporter for the New York Times --her sources, in a very abstract and hard-to-follow case.And journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws.The shield laws are our laws -- pretty much a patchwork of state laws --that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source.This is happening, however, against the backgroundof the rise of Web logging.Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization.It has de-professionalized publishing.Want to publish globally anything you think today?It is a one-button operation that you can do for free.That has sent the professional class of publishing downinto the ranks of mass amateurization.And so the shield law, as much as we want it --we want a professional class of truth-tellers --it is becoming increasingly incoherent, becausethe institution is becoming incoherent.There are people in the States right nowtying themselves into knots, trying to figure outwhether or not bloggers are journalists.And the answer to that question is,it doesn't matter, because that's not the right question.Journalism was an answer to an even more important question,which is, how will society be informed?How will they share ideas and opinions?And if there is an answer to that that happens outsidethe professional framework of journalism,it makes no sense to take a professional metaphorand apply it to this distributed class.So as much as we want the shield laws,the background -- the institution to which they were attached --is becoming incoherent.Here's another example.Pro-ana, the pro-ana groups.These are groups of teenage girlswho have taken on Web logs, bulletin boards,other kinds of cooperative infrastructure,and have used it to set up support groups forremaining anorexic by choice.They post pictures of thin models, which they call "thinspiration."They have little slogans, like "Salvation through Starvation."They even have Lance Armstrong-style bracelets,these red bracelets, which signify, in the small group,I am trying to maintain my eating disorder.They trade tips, like, if you feel like eating something,clean a toilet or the litter box. The feeling will pass.We're used to support groups being beneficial.We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial.But it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral.A support group is simply a small group that wants to maintaina way of living in the context of a larger group.Now, when the larger group is a bunch of drunks,and the small group wants to stay sober, then we think,that's a great support group.But when the small group is teenage girlswho want to stay anorexic by choice, then we're horrified.What's happened is that the normative goalsof the support groups that we're used to,came from the institutions that were framing them,and not from the infrastructure.Once the infrastructure becomes generically available,the logic of the support group has been revealed to beaccessible to anyone, including people pursuing these kinds of goals.So, there are significant downsides to these changesas well as upsides. And of course, in the current environment,one need allude only lightly to the work of non-state actorstrying to influence global affairs, and taking advantage of these.This is a social map of the hijackers and their associateswho perpetrated the 9/11 attack.It was produced by analyzing their communications patternsusing a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the worldare doing the same work today for the attacks of last week.Now, this is the part of the talk where I tell youwhat's going to come as a result of all of this,but I'm running out of time, which is good,because I don't know.(Laughter)Right. As with the printing press, if it's really a revolution,it doesn't take us from Point A to Point B.It takes us from Point A to chaos.The printing press precipitated 200 years of chaos,moving from a world where the Catholic Churchwas the sort of organizing political force to the Treaty of Westphalia,when we finally knew what the new unit was: the nation state.Now, I'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this. 50.50 years in which loosely coordinated groupsare going to be given increasingly high leverage,and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives --like deciding in advance what's going to happen,or the profit motive -- the more leverage they'll get.And institutions are going to come underan increasing degree of pressure,and the more rigidly managed, and the more they relyon information monopolies, the greater the pressure is going to be.And that's going to happen one arena at a time,one institution at a time. The forces are general,but the results are going to be specific.And so the point here is not,"This is wonderful," or "We're going to see a transitionfrom only institutions to only cooperative framework."It's going to be much more complicated than that.But the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment.And since we can see it in advance and know it's coming,my argument is essentially: we might as well get good at it.Thank you very much.(Applause)

Those of you who know me know how passionate I amabout opening the space frontier.So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravitythe experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.And I want to tell you that story.I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE,for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.We have something called the Genome 100 --100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.Craig Venter chairs that event.And I met Professor Hawking,and he said his dream was to travel into space.And I said, "I can't take you there,but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earthis actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.Come back down, you weigh twice as much.You do it again and again.You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness --how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.We set out to do this.It took us 11 years to become operational.And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say,you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.(Laughter)And he wanted to go.We worked hard to get all the permissions.And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.We had a press conference,we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola,give him 25 seconds of zero-g.And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.And what he said, for me, was very moving.He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing riskof being wiped out by disaster ...I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center,up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.We had about 20 people who made donations --we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities --who flew with us.A few TEDsters here.We set up a whole ER.We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.We had everything all set in case of an emergency;God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.We took off from the shuttle landing facility,where the shuttle takes off and lands.And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and Icarefully suspended him into zero-g.Once he was there, [we] let him goto experience what weightlessness was truly like.And after that first parabola, you know,the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.So we did a second parabola.(Laughter)(Applause)And a third.(Applause)We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newtonbecause Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridgethat Isaac Newton did.And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.(Laughter)And a seventh and an eighth.And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.(Laughter)He was so happy.We are living on a precious jewel,and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.Please join us in this epic adventure.Thank you so much.(Applause)

Once upon a time, there was a dread disease that afflicted children.And in fact, among all the diseases that existed in this land,it was the worst. It killed the most children.And along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist,who came up with a partial cure for that disease.And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died,but it was certainly better than what they had before.And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free,virtually free, and was very easy to use.But the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use iton the youngest children, on infants, and on one-year-olds.And so, as a consequence, a few years later,another scientist -- perhaps maybe this scientistnot quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him,but building on the invention of the first one --came up with a second cure.And the beauty of the second cure for this diseasewas that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds.And the problem with this cure was it was very expensive,and it was very complicated to use.And although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly,almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end.But what they did, of course, since it was so complicated and expensive,they only used it on the zero-year-olds and the one-year-olds.And they kept on using the existing cure that they hadon the two-year-olds and up.And this went on for quite some time. People were happy.They had their two cures. Until a particular mother,whose child had just turned two, died of this disease.And she thought to herself, "My child just turned two,and until the child turned two, I had always usedthis complicated, expensive cure, you know, this treatment.And then the child turned two, and I started usingthe cheap and easy treatment, and I wonder" --and she wondered, like all parents who lose children wonder --"if there isn't something that I could have done,like keep on using that complicated, expensive cure."And she told all the other people, and she said,"How could it possibly be that somethingthat's cheap and simple works as well as somethingthat's complicated and expensive?"And the people thought, "You know, you're right.It probably is the wrong thing to do to switchand use the cheap and simple solution."And the government, they heard her story and the other people,and they said, "Yeah, you're right, we should make a law.We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatmentand not let anybody use this on their children."And the people were happy. They were satisfied.For many years this went along, and everything was fine.But then along came a lowly economist, who had children himself,and he used the expensive and complicated treatment.But he knew about the cheap and simple one.And he thought about it, and the expensive onedidn't seem that great to him. So he thought,"I don't know anything about science, but I do know something about data,so maybe I should go and look at the dataand see whether this expensive and complicated treatmentactually works any better than the cheap and simple one."And lo and behold, when he went through the data,he found that it didn't look like the expensive, complicatedsolution was any better than the cheap one,at least for the children who were two and older --the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger.And so, he went forth to the people and he said,"I've made this wonderful finding:it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution,and by doing so we could save ourselves 300 million dollars a year,and we could spend that on our children in other ways."And the parents were very unhappy, and they said,"This is a terrible thing, because how can the cheap and easy thingbe as good as the hard thing?" And the government was very upset.And in particular, the people who made this expensive solutionwere very upset because they thought,"How can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free?We would lose all of our market."And people were very angry, and they called him horrible names.And he decided that maybe he should leave the countryfor a few days, and seek out some more intelligent,open-minded people in a place called Oxford,and come and try and tell the story at that place.And so, anyway, here I am. It's not a fairy tale.It's a true story about the United States today,and the disease I'm referring to is actuallymotor vehicle accidents for children.And the free cure is adult seatbelts, and the expensive cure --the 300-million-dollar-a-year cure -- is child car seats.And what I'd like to talk to you about todayis some of the evidence why I believe this to be true:that for children two years old and up,there really is no real benefit -- proven benefit -- of car seats,in spite of the incredible energythat has been devoted toward expanding the lawsand making it socially unacceptableto put your children into seatbelts. And then talk about why --what is it that makes that true?And then, finally talk a little bit about a third way,about another technology, which is probably better than anything we have,but which -- there hasn't been any enthusiasm for adoptionprecisely because people are so enamoredwith the current car seat solution. OK.So, many times when you try to do research on data,it records complicated stories -- it's hard to find in the data.It doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats.So the United States keeps a data setof every fatal accident that's happened since 1975.So in every car crash in which at least one person dies,they have information on all of the people.So if you look at that data -- it's right up on the National HighwayTransportation Safety Administration's website --you can just look at the raw data,and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidencethat's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up.So, here is the data. Here I have, among two- to six-year-olds --anyone above six, basically no one uses car seats,so you can't compare -- 29.3 percent of the children who are unrestrainedin a crash in which at least one person dies, themselves die.If you put a child in a car seat, 18.2 percent of the children die.If they're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt, in this raw data,19.4 percent die. And interestingly, wearing a lap-only seatbelt,16.7 percent die. And actually, the theory tells youthat the lap-only seatbelt's got to be worsethan the lap-and-shoulder belt. And that just reminds youthat when you deal with raw data, there are hundredsof confounding variables that may be getting in the way.So what we do in the study is -- and this is just presentingthe same information, but turned into a figure to make it easier.So the yellow bar represents car seats,the orange bar lap-and-shoulder, and the red bar lap-only seatbelts.And this is all relative to unrestrained --the bigger the bar, the better. Okay.So, this is the data I just showed, OK?So the highest bar is what you're striving to beat.So you can control for the basic things, like how hard the crash was,what seat the child was sitting in, etc., the age of the child.And that's that middle set of bars.And so, you can see that the lap-only seatbeltsstart to look worse once you do that.And then finally, the last set of bars,which are really controlling for everythingyou could possibly imagine about the crash,50, 75, 100 different characteristics of the crash.And what you find is that the car seats and the lap-and-shoulder belts,when it comes to saving lives, fatalities look exactly identical.And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well.And it's not just overall. It's very robustto anything you want to look at.One thing that's interesting: if you look at frontal-impact crashes --when the car crashes, the front hits into something --indeed, what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better.And I think this isn't just chance.In order to have the car seat approved,you need to pass certain federal standards,all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash.But when you look at other types of crashes, like rear-impact crashes,indeed, the car seats don't perform as well.And I think that's because they've been optimized to pass,as we always expect people to do,to optimize relative to bright-line rulesabout how affected the car will be.And the other thing you might argue is,"Well, car seats have got a lot better over time.And so if we look at recent crashes --the whole data set is almost 30 years' worth of data --you won't see it in the recent crashes. The new car seats are far, far better."But indeed, in recent crashes the lap-and-shoulder seatbelts,actually, are doing even better than the car seats.They say, "Well, that's impossible, that can't be."And the line of argument, if you ask parents, is,"But car seats are so expensive and complicated,and they have this big tangle of latches,how could they possibly not work better than seatbeltsbecause they are so expensive and complicated?"It's kind of an interesting logic,I think, that people use. And the other logic, they say,"Well, the government wouldn't have told us [to] use themif they weren't much better."But what's interesting is the government telling us to use themis not actually based on very much.It really is based on some impassioned pleas of parentswhose children died after they turned two,which has led to the passage of all these laws -- not very much on data.So you can only get so far, I think, in telling your storyby using these abstract statistics.And so I had some friends over to dinner, and I was asking --we had a cookout -- I was asking them what advice they might have for meabout proving my point. They said, "Why don't you run some crash tests?"And I said, "That's a great idea."So we actually tried to commission some crash tests.And it turns out that as we called around to the independentcrash test companies around the country,none of them wanted to do our crash testbecause they said, some explicitly, some not so explicitly,"All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers.We can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats."Now, eventually, one did. Under the conditions of anonymity,they said they would be happy to do this test for us --so anonymity, and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed.And so, we went to Buffalo, New York,and here is the precursor to it.These are the crash test dummies,waiting for their chance to take the center stage.And then, here's how the crash test works.Here, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know --it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it.So they just have these bench seats,and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it.So I just wanted you to look at this.And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents thinkcar seats are so great. Look at the kid in the car seat.Does he not look content, ready to go,like he could survive anything? And then, if you look at the kid in back,it looks like he's already choking before the crash even happens.It's hard to believe, when you look at this, thatthat kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash.So this is going to be a crashwhere they're going to slam this thing forward into a wallat 30 miles an hour, and see what happens. OK?So, let me show you what happens.These are three-year-old dummies, by the way.So here -- this is the car seat. Now watch two things:watch how the head goes forward,and basically hits the knees -- and this is in the car seat --and watch how the car seat flies around, in the rebound, up in the air.The car seat's moving all over the place.Bear in mind there are two things about this.This is a car seat that was installed by someonewho has installed 1,000 car seats, who knew exactly how to do it.And also it turned out these bench seatsare the very best way to install car seats.Having a flat back makes it much easier to install them.And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat,OK? So, that kid in this crash fared very well.The federal standards arethat you have to score below a 1,000to be an approved car seat on this crash,in some metric of units which are not important.And this crash would have been about a 450.So this car seat was actually an above-average car seatfrom Consumer Reports, and did quite well.So the next one. Now, this is the kid, same crash,who is in the seatbelt. He hardly moves at all, actually,relative to the other child. The funny thing is,the cam work is terrible because they've only set it upto do the car seats, and so, they actually don't even have a wayto move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound.Anyway, it turns out that those two crashes, that actuallythe three-year-old did slightly worse. So, he gets about a 500out of -- you know, on this range -- relative to a 400 and something.But still, if you just took that data from that crashto the federal government, and said, "I have invented a new car seat.I would like you to approve it for selling,"then they would say, "This is a fantastic new car seat, it works great.It only got a 500, it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000."And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colorsinto being approved as a car seat.So, in some sense, what this is suggestingis that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong,which is putting children at risk. It's just that, fundamentally,the car seats aren't doing much.So here's the crash. So these are timed at the same time,so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat --at rebound, it takes a lot longer --but there's just a lot less movement for child who's in the seatbelt.So, I'll show you the six-year-old crashes as well.The six-year-old is in a car seat, and it turns outthat looks terrible, but that's great. That's like a 400, OK?So that kid would do fine in the crash.Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all.And then here's the six-year-old in the seatbelt,and in fact, they get exactly within, you know,within one or two points of the same. So really, for the six-year-old,the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever.That's some more evidence, so in some sense --I was criticized by a scientist, who said, "You could never publisha study with an n of 4," meaning those four crashes.So I wrote him back and I said, "What about an n of 45,004?"Because I had the other 45,000 other real-world crashes.And I just think that it's interesting that the ideaof using real-world crashes, which is very much somethingthat economists think would be the right thing to do,is something that scientists don't actually, usually think --they would rather use a laboratory,a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies,than actually 30 years of data of what we've seenwith children and with car seats.And so I think the answer to this puzzleis that there's a much better solution out there,that's gotten nobody excited because everyoneis so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working.And if you think from a design perspective,about going back to square one, and say,"I just want to protect kids in the back seat."I don't there's anyone in this room who'd say,"Well, the right way to start would be,let's make a great seat belt for adults.And then, let's make this really big contraptionthat you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain."I mean, why not start -- who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids?But essentially, do something like this,which I don't know exactly how much it would cost to do,but there's no reason I could seewhy this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat.It's just actually -- you see, this is folding up -- it's behind the seat.You've got a regular seat for adults, and then you fold it down,and the kid sits on top, and it's integrated.It seems to me that this can't be a very expensive solution,and it's got to work better than what we already have.So the question is, is there any hope for adoption of something like this,which would presumably save a lot of lives?And I think the answer, perhaps, lies in a story.The answer both to why has a car seat been so successful,and why this may someday be adopted or not,lies in a story that my dad told me, relating to when he was a doctorin the U.S. Air Force in England. And this is a long time ago:you were allowed to do things then you can't do today.So, my father would have patients come inwho he thought were not really sick.And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them,and he'd say, "Come back in a week, if you still feel lousy."OK, and most of them would not come back,but some of them would come back.And when they came back, he, still convinced they were not sick,had another jar of pills. In this jar were huge horse pills.They were almost impossible to swallow.And these, to me, are the analogy for the car seats.People would look at these and say, "Man, this thing is so bigand so hard to swallow. If this doesn't make me feel better,you know, what possibly could?"And it turned out that most people wouldn't come back,because it worked. But every once in a while,there was still a patient convinced that he was sick,and he'd come back. And my dad had a third jar of pills.And the jar of pills he had, he said,were the tiniest little pills he could find,so small you could barely see them.And he would say, listen, I know I gave you that huge pill,that complicated, hard-to-swallow pill before,but now I've got one that's so potent,that is really tiny and small and almost invisible.It's almost like this thing here, which you can't even see."And it turned out that never,in all the times my dad gave out this pill, the really tiny pill,did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness.So, my dad always took that as evidencethat this little, teeny, powerful pillhad the ultimate placebo effect. And in some sense, if that's the right story,I think integrated car seats you will see, very quickly,becoming something that everyone has. The other possible conclusionis, well, maybe after coming to my father three times,getting sent home with placebos, he still felt sick,he went and found another doctor.And that's completely possible. And if that's the case,then I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come.Thank you very much.(Applause)(Audience: I just wanted to ask you, when we wear seatbeltswe don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life,it's also to prevent lots of serious injury.Your data looks at fatalities. It doesn't look at serious injury.Is there any data to show that child seatsare actually less effective, or just as effective as seatbeltsfor serious injury? Because that would prove your case.)Steven Levitt: Yeah, that's a great question. In my data, and in another data setI've looked at for New Jersey crashes,I find very small differences in injury.So in this data, it's statistically insignificant differencesin injury between car seats and lap-and-shoulder belts.In the New Jersey data, which is different,because it's not just fatal crashes,but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported,it turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in injuries,but generally they're the minor injuries.Now, what's interesting, I should say this as a disclaimer,there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data,which suggests that car seats are dramatically better.And they use a completely different methodology that involves --after the crash occurs, they get from the insurance companiesthe names of the people who were in the crash,and they call them on the phone,and they asked them what happened.And I really can't resolve, yet,and I'd like to work with these medical researchersto try to understand how there can be these differences,which are completely at odds with one another.But it's obviously a critical question.The question is even if -- are there enough serious injuriesto make these cost-effective? It's kind of tricky.Even if they're right, it's not so clearthat they're so cost-effective.

My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously,on a collective level.And what I mean by that, it's the behaviorsthat we're in denial about,and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness.And as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday.It's like when you're mean to your wifebecause you're mad at somebody else.Or when you drink a little too much at a party, just out of anxiety.Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt, or whatever.And when we do these kind of things,when 300 million people do unconscious behaviors,then it can add up to a catastrophic consequencethat nobody wants, and no one intended.And that's what I look at with my photographic work.This is an image I just recently completed, that is --when you stand back at a distance,it looks like some kind of neo-Gothic, cartoon imageof a factory spewing out pollution.And as you get a little bit closer,it starts looking like lots of pipes, like maybe a chemical plant,or a refinery, or maybe a hellish freeway interchange.And as you get all the way up close,you realize that it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups.And in fact, this is one million plastic cups,which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flightsin the United States every six hours.We use four million cups a day on airline flights,and virtually none of them are reused or recycled.They just don't do that in that industry.Now, that number is dwarfedby the number of paper cups we use every day,and that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages,most of which is coffee.I couldn't fit 40 million cups on a canvas,but I was able to put 410,000. That's what 410,000 cups looks like.That's 15 minutes of our cup consumption.And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life,that's the size it would be.And there's an hour's worth of our cups.And there's a day's worth of our cups.You can still see the little people way down there.That's as high as a 42-story building,and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference.Speaking of justice, there's another phenomenon going on in our culturethat I find deeply troubling, and that is that America, right now,has the largest percentage of its population in prisonof any country on Earth.One out of four people, one out of four humans in prisonare Americans, imprisoned in our country.And I wanted to show the number.The number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005.And that's gone up since then, but we don't have the numbers yet.So, I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms,and in the actual print of this piece,each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge.They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material,and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvasthat was larger than any printer in the world would print.And so I had to divide it up into multiple panelsthat are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide.This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York --those are my parents looking at the piece.(Laughter)Every time I look at this piece,I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad,"He finally folded his laundry."(Laughter)I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction.And this particular one is about cigarette addiction.I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americanswho die from cigarette smoking.More than 400,000 people die in the United States every yearfrom smoking cigarettes.And so, this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes.And, as you slowly step back,you see that it's a painting by Van Gogh, called "Skull with Cigarette."It's a strange thing to think about, that on 9/11,when that tragedy happened, 3,000 Americans died.And do you remember the response?It reverberated around the world,and will continue to reverberate through time.It will be something that we talk about in 100 years.And yet on that same day, 1,100 Americans died from smoking.And the day after that, another 1,100 Americans died from smoking.And every single day since then, 1,100 Americans have died.And today, 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking.And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it.The tobacco lobby, it's too strong.We just dismiss it out of our consciousness.And knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes,we continue to allow our children, our sons and daughters,to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking.And this is what the next piece is about.This is just lots and lots of cigarettes: 65,000 cigarettes,which is equal to the number of teenagerswho will start smoking this month, and every month in the U.S.More than 700,000 children in the United States aged 18 and underbegin smoking every year.One more strange epidemic in the United Statesthat I want to acquaint you withis this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs.This is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin.Well, actually, I only had one Vicodinthat I scanned lots and lots of times.(Laughter)And so, as you stand back, you see 213,000 Vicodin pills,which is the number of hospital emergency room visitsyearly in the United States,attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillersand anti-anxiety medications.One-third of all drug overdoses in the U.S. --and that includes cocaine, heroin, alcohol, everything --one-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications.A strange phenomenon.This is a piece that I just recently completedabout another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon,this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.384,000 women, American women, last yearwent in for elective breast augmentation surgery.It's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift,given to young girls who are about to go off to college.So, I made this image out of Barbie dolls,and so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern,and as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls,which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeriesthat are performed in the U.S. each month.The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21.And strangely enough, the only plastic surgerythat is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction,and most of that is being done by men.Now, I want to emphasize that these are just examples.I'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues.They're just examples.And the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fearthat we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now.There's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment.We've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our griefabout what's going on in our culture right now,what's going on in our country,the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world.They've gone missing; these feelings have gone missing.Our cultural joy, our national joy is nowhere to be seen.And one of the causes of this, I think,is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview,this holoptical worldview, this holographic imagethat we're all trying to create in our mindof the interconnection of things: the environmental footprints1,000 miles away of the things that we buy;the social consequences 10,000 miles awayof the daily decisions that we make as consumers.As we try to build this view,and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture,the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers:numbers in the millions, in the hundreds of millions,in the billions and now in the trillions.Bush's new budget is in the trillions, and these are numbersthat our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend.We can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics.And so that's what I'm trying to do with my work,is to take these numbers, these statisticsfrom the raw language of data, and to translate theminto a more universal visual language, that can be felt.Because my belief is, if we can feel these issues,if we can feel these things more deeply,then they'll matter to us more than they do now.And if we can find that,then we'll be able to find, within each one of us,what it is that we need to find to face the big question,which is: how do we change?That, to me, is the big question that we face as a people right now:how do we change? How do we change as a culture,and how do we each individually take responsibilityfor the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of,and that is our own behavior?My belief is that you don't have to make yourself badto look at these issues.I'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way.I'm simply saying, this is who we are right now.And if there are things that we seethat we don't like about our culture,then we have a choice.The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface,to bring to this question, the depth of character that we can summon,as we show up for the question of how do we change --it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation,and it will continue to do that, on into the future.And it will profoundly affect the well-being, the quality of lifeof the billions of peoplewho are going to inherit the results of our decisions.I'm not speaking abstractly about this,I'm speaking -- this is who we are in this room,right now, in this moment.Thank you and good afternoon.(Applause)



paul_collier_shares_4_ways_to_help_the_bottom_billion
916798

So, can we dare to be optimistic?Well, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion"is that a billion people have been stuck livingin economies that have been stagnant for 40 years,and hence diverging from the rest of mankind.And so, the real question to pose is not, "Can we be optimistic?"It's, "How can we give credible hope to that billion people?"That, to my mind, is the fundamental challenge now of development.What I'm going to offer you is a recipe,a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good,which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest.Compassion, because a billion people are living in societiesthat have not offered credible hope.That is a human tragedy.Enlightened self-interest, because if that economic divergencecontinues for another 40 years,combined with social integration globally,it will build a nightmare for our children.We need compassion to get ourselves started,and enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious.That's the alliance that changes the world.So, what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion?What can we actually do?Well, a good guide is to think,"What did we do last time the rich world got seriousabout developing another region of the world?"That gives us, it turns out, quite a good clue,except you have to go back quite a long time.The last time the rich world got seriousabout developing another region was in the late 1940s.The rich world was you, America,and the region that needed to be developed was my world, Europe.That was post-War Europe.Why did America get serious?It wasn't just compassion for Europe, though there was that.It was that you knew you had to,because, in the late 1940s, country after country in Central Europewas falling into the Soviet bloc, and so you knew you'd no choice.Europe had to be dragged into economic development.So, what did you do, last time you got serious?Well, yes, you had a big aid program. Thank you very much.That was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution.But what else did you do?Well, you tore up your trade policy, and totally reversed it.Before the war, America had been highly protectionist.After the war, you opened your markets to Europe,you dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy,and you institutionalized that trade liberalizationthrough founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.So, total reversal of trade policy.Did you do anything else?Yes, you totally reversed your security policy.Before the war, your security policy had been isolationist.After the war, you tear that up, you put 100,000 troops in Europefor over 40 years.So, total reversal of security policy. Anything else?Yes, you tear up the "Eleventh Commandment" --national sovereignty.Before the war, you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanctthat you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations.After the war, you found the United Nations,you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,you found the IMF, you encouraged Europe to create the European Community --all systems for mutual government support.That is still the waterfront of effective policies:aid, trade, security, governments.Of course, the details of policy are going to be different,because the challenge is different.It's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergencefor the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up.Is that easier or harder?We need to be at least as serious as we were then.Now, today I'm going to take just one of those four.I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest,the one that's just motherhood and apple pie --governments, mutual systems of support for governments --and I'm going to show you one ideain how we could do something to strengthen governance,and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now.The opportunity we're going to look tois a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion,and that is the commodity booms.The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of moneyinto many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion.Partly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high,but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries.Uganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth;Ghana has discovered oil;Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground.So, a mass of new discoveries.Between them, these new revenue flows dwarf aid.Just to give you one example:Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue.The entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion.So, the flow of resources from the commodity boomsto the bottom billion are without precedent.So there's the optimism.The question is, how is it going to help their development?It's a huge opportunity for transformational development.Will it be taken?So, here comes a bit of science, and this is a bit of science I've donesince "The Bottom Billion," so it's new.I've looked to see what is the relationship betweenhigher commodity prices of exports,and the growth of commodity-exporting countries.And I've looked globally, I've taken all the countries in the worldfor the last 40 years,and looked to see what the relationship is.And the short run -- say, the first five to seven years -- is just great.In fact, it's hunky dory: everything goes up.You get more money because your terms of trade have improved,but also that drives up output across the board.So GDP goes up a lot -- fantastic! That's the short run.And how about the long run?Come back 15 years later.Well, the short run, it's hunky dory,but the long run, it's humpty dumpty.You go up in the short run, but then most societieshistorically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all.That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go;it's a forecast of the consequences, the long-term consequences,for growth of an increase in prices.So, what goes wrong? Why is there this "resource curse," as it's called?And again, I've looked at that, and it turns outthat the critical issue is the level of governance,the initial level of economic governance,when the resource booms accrue.In fact, if you've got good enough governance,there is no resource boom.You go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term.That's Norway, the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada.The resource curse is entirely confined to countriesbelow a threshold of governance.They still go up in the short run.That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment.The best growth rates they've had -- ever.And the question is whether the short run will persist.And with bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't.It's countries like Nigeria, which are worse off than if they'd never had oil.So, there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term,and below which you go down.Just to benchmark that threshold,it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s.So, the question is, are the bottom billion above or below that threshold?Now, there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s,and that is the spread of democracy.So I thought, well, maybe that is the thingwhich has transformed governance in the bottom billion.Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy.So, I looked. Democracy does have significant effects --and unfortunately, they're adverse.Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies.At that stage I just wanted to abandon the research, but --(Laughter)-- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that.Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy:there's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power,and there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power.It turns out that electoral competition is the thingthat's doing the damage with democracy,whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good.And so, what the countries of the bottom billion needis very strong checks and balances.They haven't got them.They got instant democracy in the 1990s:elections without checks and balances.How can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances?In all the societies of the bottom billion,there are intense struggles to do just that.The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards,which will be voluntary, but which would spell out the key decision pointsthat need to be taken in orderto harness these resource revenues.We know these international standards workbecause we've already got one.It's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.That is the very simple idea that governments should reportto their citizens what revenues they have.No sooner was it proposedthan reformers in Nigeria adopted it, pushed it and published the revenues in the paper.Nigerian newspapers circulations spiked.People wanted to know what their government was gettingin terms of revenue.So, we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards?I can't go through all of them, but I'll give you an example.The first is how to take the resources out of the ground --the economic processes, taking the resources out of the groundand putting assets on top of the ground.And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction.You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment,how they've been sold over the last 40 years?A company flies in, does a deal with a minister.And that's great for the company,and it's quite often great for the minister --(Laughter)-- and it's not great for their country.There's a very simple institutional technologywhich can transform that,and it's called verified auctions.The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earthis of course the treasury -- that is, the British Treasury.And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rightsto third-generation mobile phonesby working out what those rights were worth.They worked out they were worth two billion pounds.Just in time, a set of economists got there and said,"Why not try an auction? It'll reveal the value."It went for 20 billion pounds through auction.If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10,think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like.(Laughter)When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone,the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a teamto give expertise on how to conduct auctions.There are five such decision points;each one needs an international standard.If we could do it, we would change the world.We would be helping the reformers in these societies,who are struggling for change.That's our modest role. We cannot change these societies,but we can help the people in these societieswho are struggling and usually failing,because the odds are so stacked against them.And yet, we've not got these rules.If you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rulesis zilch -- nothing.Why on Earth are they not there?I realized that the reason they're not thereis that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies,politicians will get away with gestures.That unless we have an informed society,what politicians do, especially in relation to Africa, is gestures:things that look good, but don't work.And so I realized we had to go through the businessof building an informed citizenry.That's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist,and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach.(Laughter).However, I have to say, the process of communicationdoes not come naturally to me.This is why I'm on this stage, but it's alarming.I grew up in a culture of self-effacement.My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks,and the blog comment said, "Collier is not charismatic --(Laughter)-- but his arguments are compelling."(Laughter)(Applause)If you agree with that sentiment,and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry,you will realize that I need you.Please, become ambassadors.Thank you.(Applause)



yves_behar_on_designing_objects_that_tell_stories
1060920

Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house,I remember these Turkish carpets,and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spearfrom this soldier.And my mom took these pictures actually, last week,of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniturewith creatures and gargoyles and nudity --pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories,so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.And then there was another influence.I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers,we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.And so,I fused together the two things I loved the most,which was skiing and windsurfing.Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.So, I created this compilation of the two:I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there,and some foot straps, and some metal fins,and here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.It was really a death trap. I mean, it was incredible,it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.And I realized then I had to go to design school.(Laughter)I mean, look at those graphics there.(Laughter)So, I went to design school,and it was the early '90s when I finished.And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley,so I wanted to be there,and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes,that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy,and we would get in to these meetings,and these managers would come in,and they would say,"Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."And they would give the projects code names, you know,mostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.So, in anticipation, I would be this young designerin the back of the room, and I would raise my hand,and I would ask questions.I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions,but things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?"or "What's this Num Lock key for?" You know, that thing?"You know, do people really use it?Do they need it? Do they want it in their homes?"(Laughter)What I realized then is, they didn't really want to changethe legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides.They were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins,to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.And I didn't want to be a colorist.It wasn't what I wanted to do.I didn't want to be a stylist in this way.And then I saw this quote:"advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."(Laughter)So, I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco,and I started a little company, fuseproject.And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.And I wanted to really not just work on the skins,but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.And so the first projects were sort of humble,but they took technology and maybe made it into thingsthat people would use in a new way,and maybe finding some new functionality.This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company,right when it launched,and it's the first watch that has a displaythat switches from horizontal to vertical.And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here,without bending my elbow.And other projects, which were really about transformation,about matching the human need.This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer,and it ships completely flat,and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.And something a little bit more experimental:this is a light fixture for Swarovski,and what it does is, it changes shape.So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.And just by drawing on a little computer tablet,the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.This is a pretty involved process;it took us about four and a half years.But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light,a new experience of light.So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.And the new experience I was looking foris giving the choice for the user to go froma warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light,all the way to a bright work light.So, the light bulb actually does that.It allows the person to switch,and to mix these two colorations.And it's done in a very simple way:one just touches the base of the light,and on one side, you can mix the brightness,and on the other, the coloration of the light.So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them,and I think as designers we need to really thinkabout how we can create a different relationshipbetween our work and the world,whether it's for business,or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bringvalue to business, value to the users also,but I think it's the values that we put into these projectsthat ultimately create the greater value.And the values we bringcan be about environmental issues,about sustainability, about lower power consumption.You know, they can be about function and beauty;they can be about business strategy.But designers are really the gluethat brings these things together.So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with,and it has a humanistic technology.It feels your skin. It rests on your skin,and it knows when it is you're talking.And by knowing when it is you're talking,it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about,which is the environmental noises.But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawboneis that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff,and all the nerdy stuff out of it,and try to make it as beautiful as we can.I mean, think about it:the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry,or accessories is really important,so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.And this is what we're pursuing here.But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.I want to point at something here, on the left.This is the board, this is one of the things that goes insidethat makes this technology work.But this is the design process:there's somebody changing the board,putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs,as the designers on the other side are doing the work.So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.It's really about designing from the inside out.And then, on the other side of the room,the designers are making small adjustments,sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.And it's what I call being design driven.You know, there is some push and pull,but design is really helping definethe whole experience from the inside out.And then, of course, design is never done.And this is -- the other new way that is uniquein how we work is, because it's never done,you have to do all this other stuff.The packaging, and the website, and you need to continueto really touch the user, in many ways.But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone,you know, really understands that you need a different structure.So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners,it's a partnership. We can continue to workand dedicate ourselves to this project,and then we also share in the rewards.And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.This is called Y Water,and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt,Austrian originally, who came to us,and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink,or an organic drink for his kids,to replace the high-sugar-content sodasthat he's trying to get them away from.So, we worked on this bottle,and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.The bottles connect together,and you can create different shapes, different forms.(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)And then while we were doing this,the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y,and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not,"are probably the most important words that kids ask.So we called it Y Water. And so this isanother place where it all comes together in the same room:the three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding,it all becomes deeply connected.And then the other thing about this project is,we bring intellectual property,we bring a marketing approach,we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day,what we bring is these values,and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.And it's especially rewarding when your design workbecomes a creative endeavor,when others can be creative and do more with it.Here's another project,which I think really emulates that.This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.This picture is incredible.In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.I mean, to me, it just means so much.But when Nicholas Negroponte --and he has spoken about this project a lot,he's the founder of OLPC -- came to usabout two and a half years ago,there were some clear ideas.He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology,and those are pillars of his life,but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.But the third pillar that he talked about was design.And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.But what he said was really significant,is that design was going to be why the kidswere going to love this product,how we were going to make it low cost, robust.And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key --(Laughter) --and the Num Lock key, too.So, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic,to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.And then the integration ofall these great technologies, which you've heard about,the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect;the screen, which you can read in sunlight;the keyboard, which is made out of rubber,and it's protected from the environment.You know, all these great technologies really happenedbecause of the passion andthe OLPC people and the engineers.They fought the suppliers,they fought the manufacturers.I mean, they fought like animalsfor this to remain they way it is.And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one --allows the processfrom not destroying the original idea.And I think this is something really important.So, now you get these pictures --you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeriaand you see them in Uruguaywith their computers, and in Mongolia.And we went away from obviously the beige.I mean it's colorful, it's fun.In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.It's because we were ableto run, during the manufacturing process,20 colors for the X and the O,which is the name of the computer,and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor,you get 20 times 20: you get400 different options there.So, the lessons from seeing the kidsusing them in the developing world are incredible.But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland,and he had the laptop for an afternoon,and I had to take it back. It was hard.(Laughter)And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later,I come back to Switzerland,and there he is playing with his own version.(Laughter)Like paper, paper and cardboard.So, I'm going to finish with one last project,and this is a little bit more of adult play.(Laughter)Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day,February 14, about 10 days ago.So, the Department of Health in New York came to us,and they needed a way to distribute36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant,and it has to be easily serviceable:you have to know where it is and what it does.And we also designed the condoms themselves.And I was just in New York at the launch,and I went to see all these places where they're installed:this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store;at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.Of course, clubs and discos, too.And here's the public service announcement for this project.(Music)(Laughter)Get some.(Applause)So, this is really where designis able to create a conversation.I was in these venues, and people were,you know, really into getting them. They were excited.It was breaking the ice,it was getting over a stigma,and I think that's also what design can do.So, I was going tothrow some condoms in the room and whatnot,but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.(Laughter)Yeah? All right, all right. I have only a few.(Laughter)(Applause)So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.(Laughter)And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom,you can just say you like the design.(Laughter)So, I'll finish with just one thought:if we all work together on creating value,but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do,I think we can change the work that we do.We can change these values, can change the companies we work with,and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.So, thank you.(Applause)

How does the news shape the way we see the world?Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass.And here's how news shapes what Americans see.This map -- (Applause) -- this map shows the number of secondsthat American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories,by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago.Now, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.There was massive flooding in Indonesia.And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage.And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent,we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else.The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent.When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story,here's how the world looked.What was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith.This story eclipsed every country except Iraq,and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report.And the cycle continues;as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately.So, why don't we hear more about the world?One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half.Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai,there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America-- places that are home to more than two billion people.The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbingwhen we see where people go for news.Local TV news looms large,and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.And what about the web?The most popular news sites don't do much better.Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 storiesthat appeared on Google News' front page.And they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events.Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creatorsis recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters,and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it.So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates,as well as less educated Americans,know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago.And if you think it's simply because we are not interested,you would be wrong.In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the timegrew to over 50 percent.The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americansin our increasingly interconnected world?I know we can do better.And can we afford not to? Thank you.

One of the problems of writing, and working, and looking at the Internetis that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change.And so, to start helping that, I want to take us back to 1835.In 1835, James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaperin New York City.And it cost about 500 dollars to start it,which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today.By 15 years later, by 1850, doing the same thing-- starting what was experienced as a mass--circulation daily paper-- would come to cost two and a half million dollars.10,000, two and a half million, 15 years.That's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net.And that's what I want to talk about today,and how that relates to the emergence of social production.Starting with newspapers, what we saw was high cost as an initial requirementfor making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcationbetween producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital,just like any other industrial organization --and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set ofthings that this industrial model could produce.Now, the term "information society," "information economy,"for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes afterthe industrial revolution. But in fact, for purposes of understanding what's happeningtoday, that's wrong. Because for 150 years, we've had an information economy.It's just been industrial,which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising moneyto pay those two and a half million dollars, and later, more for the telegraph,and the radio transmitter, and the television, and eventually the mainframe.And that meant they were market based, or they were government owned,depending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchoredthe way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years.Now, let me tell you a different story. Around June 2002,the world of supercomputers had a bombshell.The Japanese had, for the first time, created the fastest supercomputer --the NEC Earth Simulator -- taking the primary from the U.S.,and about two years later -- this, by the way, is measuring the trillion floating-pointoperations per second that the computer's capable of running --sigh of relief: IBM [Blue Gene] has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator.All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period,there's another supercomputer running in the world -- SETI@home.Four and a half million users around the world, contributing theirleftover computer cycles, whenever their computer isn't working,by running a screen saver, and together sharing their resources to createa massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the datacoming from radio telescopes.What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the wayinformation production and exchange is capitalized. Not that it's becomeless capital intensive -- that there's less money that's required-- but that the ownership of this capital, the way the capitalization happens,is radically distributed. Each of us, in these advanced economies,has one of these, or something rather like it -- a computer.They're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network.And computation, storage and communications capacity are in the hands ofpractically every connected person -- and these are the basic physicalcapital means necessary for producing information, knowledge and culture,in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet.What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution,the most important means, the most important components of the coreeconomic activities -- remember, we are in an information economy-- of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else,are in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we'veseen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computationcapacity in the hands of the entire population,and we've got human creativity, human wisdom, human experience-- the other major experience, the other major input --which unlike simple labor -- stand here turning this lever all day long --is not something that's the same or fungible among people.Any one of you who has taken someone else's job, or tried to give yoursto someone else, no matter how detailed the manual, you cannot transmitwhat you know, what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances.In that we're unique, and each of us holds this critical inputinto production as we hold this machine.What's the effect of this? So, the story that most people knowis the story of free or open source software.This is market share of Apache Web server-- one of the critical applications in Web-based communications.In 1995, two groups of people said,"Wow, this is really important, the Web! We need a much better Web server!"One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided,you know, we really need this, we should write one,and what are we going to do with what --well, we're gonna share it! And other people will be able to develop it.The other was Microsoft.Now, if I told you that 10 years later, the motley crew of people, who didn't controlanything that they produced, acquired 20 percent of the marketand was the red line, it would be amazing! Right?Think of it in minivans. A group of automobileengineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right?But, in fact, of course, the story is it's the 70 percent,including the major e-commerce site -- 70 percent of a critical applicationon which Web-based communications and applications work is produced in this form, indirect competition with Microsoft. Not in a side issue --in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net.Software has done this in a way that's been very visible, becauseit's measurable. But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web.So, NASA, at some point, did an experiment where they took images of Marsthat they were mapping, and they said, instead of having three or fourfully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time, let's break it up into small components,put it up on the Web, and see if people, using a very simple interface,will actually spend five minutes here,10 minutes there, clicking. After six months,85,000 people used this to generate mapping at afaster rate than the images were coming in, which was, quote,"practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained Ph.D.,"once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average.Now, if you have a little girl, and she goes and writes to-- well, not so little, medium little -- tries to do research on Barbie.And she'll come to Encarta, one of the main online encyclopedias.This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it, there's nothing more to the definition,including, "manufacturers" -- plural -- "now more commonly produceethnically diverse dolls, like this black Barbie." Which is vastly betterthan what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com,which is Barbie, Klaus. (Laughter)On the other hand, if they go to Wikipedia, they'll find a genuine article-- and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia, because Jimmy Wales is here --but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica, differently written,including the controversies over body image and commercialization,the claims about the way in which she's a good role model, etc.Another portion is not only how content is produced, but how relevance is produced.The claim to fame of Yahoo! was, we hire people to look -- originally, not anymore-- we hire people to look at websites and tell you --if they're in the index, they're good. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project,each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about,to say, this is good. So, this is the Open Directory Project, with 60,000 volunteers,each one spending a little bit of time, as opposed to a few hundredfully paid employees. No one owns it, no one owns the output,it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of socialand psychological motivations to do something interesting.This is not only outside of businesses. When you think of what is the critical innovationof Google, the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing --the decision about what's relevant -- to the community of the Web as a whole,doing whatever they want to do: so, page rank.The critical innovation here is instead of our engineers, or our people sayingwhich is the most relevant, we're going to go out and count what you,people out there on the Web, for whatever reason -- vanity, pleasure --produced links, and tied to each other. We're going to count those, and count them up.And again, here, you see Barbie.com, but also, very quickly,Adiosbarbie.com, the body image for every size. A contested cultural object,which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture, which is the classicmarket-based mechanism: whoever pays the most is highest on the list.So, all of that is in the creation of content, of relevance, basic human expression.But remember, the computers were also physical. Just physical materials-- our PCs -- we share them together. We also see this in wireless.It used to be wireless was one person owned the license, they transmitted in anarea, and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property.What we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticatedthat we're developing algorithms to let people own machines, like Wi-Fi devices,and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like thisto build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle:When I'm listening, when I'm not using, I can help you transfer your messages;and when you're not using, you'll help me transfer yours.And this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in someplaces in the United States are being implemented, at least for public security.If in 1999 I told you, let's build a data storage and retrieval system.It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available 24 hours a day,seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world.It has to support over 100 million users at any given moment. It's got tobe robust to attack, including closing the main index, injecting malicious files,armed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years.It would take millions. But of course, what I'm describing is P2P file sharing.Right? We always think of it as stealing music, but fundamentally,it's a distributed data storage and retrieval system, where people,for very obvious reasons, are willing to share their bandwidth and theirstorage to create something.So, essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactionalframework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along whichyou could divide things. They could be market based, or non-market based;they could be decentralized, or centralized.The price system was a market-based and decentralized system.If things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them,you had firms, if you wanted to be in the market -- or you had governmentsor sometimes larger non-profits in the non-market.It was too expensive to have decentralized social production,to have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself.That was, in fact, economic.But what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth systemof social sharing and exchange.Not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other, or for each other,as social beings. We do it all the time.It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact.What characterizes them is decentralized authority.You don't have to ask permission, as you do in a property-based system.May I do this? It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share,if they want to, by themselves or with others,because property is one mechanism of coordination.But it's not the only one.Instead, what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we useproperty and contract in the market: information flows to decide what areinteresting problems; who's available and good for something;motivation structures -- remember, money isn't always the best motivator.If you leave a $50 check after dinner with friends,you don't increase the probability of being invited back.And if dinner isn't entirely obvious, think of sex. (Laughter)It also requires certain new organizational approaches.And in particular, what we've seen is task organization.You have to hire people who know what they're doing.You have to hire them to spend a lot of time.Now, take the same problem,chunk it into little modules, and motivations become trivial.Five minutes, instead of watching TV?Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun.Just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning, or, in places that are moreinvolved, like Wikipedia, gives me a certain set of social relations.So, a new social phenomenon is emerging.It's creating, and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition.Peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry;free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft;Skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms;Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias.But it's also a new source of opportunities for businesses.As you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging,you have new opportunities. Some of them are toolmakers.Instead of building well-behaved appliances-- things that you know what they'll do in advance --you begin to build more open tools. There's a new set of values,a new set of things people value.You build platforms for self-expression and collaboration.Like Wikipedia, like the Open Directory Project,you're beginning to build platforms, and you see that as a model.And you see surfers, people who see this happening, and in some sensebuild it into a supply chain, which is a very curious one. Right?You have a belief: stuff will flow out of connected human beings.That'll give me something I can use, and I'm going to contract with someone.I will deliver something based on what happens. It's very scary-- that's what Google does, essentially.That's what IBM does in software services, and they've done reasonably well.So, social production is a real fact, not a fad.It is the critical long-term shift caused by the Internet.Social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they everwere as an economic phenomenon. In some contexts, it's even more efficientbecause of the quality of the information, the ability to find the best person,the lower transaction costs. It's sustainable and growing fast.But -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by-- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems.So next time you open the paper, and you see an intellectual property decision,a telecoms decision, it's not about something small and technical.It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other,and the way information, knowledge and culture will be produced.Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will befor the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes,or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model,and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see.Thank you.

Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back,just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.You can mimic what you can see.You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program,control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.I'm going to tell you about that technology.People have wanted to look inside the human mind,the human brain, for thousands of years.Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.People envision this as being very difficult.You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.It was terribly dangerous. (Laughter)You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.But now, we have a real technology to do this.We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation.We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body --but more importantly, we can look into his mind.When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see thereis the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms,that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds,and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.There have been three ways to try to impact the brain:the therapist's couch, pills and the knife.This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.We all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time,it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain,we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information,and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.So put your arms back up and flex your bicep.Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brainand select brain areas to do that same thing.What you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.They're watching their own brain activation,and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.As they do it, in the upper left is a displaythat's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.When they control their brain, they can control their pain.This is an investigational technology,but, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.This is not "The Matrix." You can only do this to yourself. You take control.I've seen inside my brain. You will too, soon.When you do, what do you want to control?You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail.But I want to leave with you the big question.We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into,using this technology, the human mind and brain.Where will we take it?

I'm here to enlist youin helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done.Here is the old story -- we've already heard a little bit about it:biology is war in which only the fiercest survive;businesses and nations succeed only by defeating,destroying and dominating competition;politics is about your side winning at all costs.But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge.It's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines,in which cooperation, collective action and complex interdependenciesplay a more important role.And the central, but not all-important, role of competition and survival of the fittestshrinks just a little bit to make room.I started thinking about the relationship between communication, mediaand collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs,"and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it.In fact, if you look back, human communication mediaand the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time.Humans have lived for much, much longerthan the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilizationin small family groups. Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits, gathering food.The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive.But at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game.And we don't know exactly how they did this,although they must have solved some collective action problems;it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodonswhile you're fighting with the other groups.And again, we have no way of knowing,but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted.So that raised a social questionthat I believe must have driven new social forms.Did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe somethingto the hunters and their families?And if so, how did they make arrangements?Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form ofsymbolic communication must have been involved.Of course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations,the first cities built of mud and brick, the first empires.And it was the administers of these empireswho began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owedand the taxes that was owed on themby making marks; marks on clay in that time.Not too much longer after that, the alphabet was invented.And this powerful tool was really reserved, for thousands of years,for the elite administrators (Laughter) who kept track of accounts for the empires.And then another communication technology enabled new media:the printing press came along, and within decades,millions of people became literate.And from literate populations,new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge,religion and politics.We saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation,constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.Not created by the printing press,but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy.And again, new forms of wealth emerged.Now, commerce is ancient. Markets are as old as the crossroads.But capitalism, as we know it, is only a few hundred years old,enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies,such as the joint-stock ownership company,shared liability insurance, double-entry bookkeeping.Now of course, the enabling technologies are based on the Internet,and in the many-to-many era, every desktop is now a printing press,a broadcasting station, a community or a marketplace.Evolution is speeding up.More recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops,and very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant proportion, if not the majority ofthe human race, walking around holding, carrying or wearing supercomputerslinked at speeds greaterthan what we consider to be broadband today.Now, when I started looking into collective action,the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call "social dilemmas."And there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas.I'm going to talk briefly about two of them:the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons.Now, when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly,he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the detailsof the prisoner's dilemma,so I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly.If you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly later. (Laughter)The prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaidon a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theoryin the early years of thinking about nuclear war:two players who couldn't trust each other.Let me just say that every unsecured transactionis a good example of a prisoner's dilemma.Person with the goods, person with the money,because they can't trust each other, are not going to exchange.Neither one wants to be the first oneor they're going to get the sucker's payoff,but both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want.If they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma intoa different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed.Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemmaas a probe of the biological question:if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors,how does cooperation exist at all?He started a computer tournament forpeople to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered,much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won --it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won,it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemmais the ultimatum game,and it's also a very interesting probe ofour assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.Here's how the game is played: there are two players;they've never played the game before,they will not play the game again, they don't know each other,and they are, in fact, in separate rooms.First player is offered a hundred dollarsand is asked to propose a split: 50/50, 90/10,whatever that player wants to propose. The second player either accepts the split --both players are paid and the game is over --or rejects the split -- neither player is paid and the game is over.Now, the fundamental basis of neoclassical economicswould tell you it's irrational to reject a dollarbecause someone you don't know in another room is going to get 99.Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students,a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to 50/50.And although they were screened and didn't know about the gameand had never played the game before,proposers seemed to innately know thisbecause the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50/50.Now, the interesting part comes in more recentlywhen anthropologists began taking this game to other culturesand discovered, to their surprise,that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the Amazonor nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures --each had radically different ideas of what is fair.Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness,that somehow the basis of our economictransactions can be influenced by our social institutions,whether we know that or not.The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons.Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.He used the example of a common grazing area in which each personby simply maximizing their own flockled to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource.He had the rather gloomy conclusion thathumans will inevitably despoil any common pool resourcein which people cannot be restrained from using it.Now, Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist, in1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask,which is: is it really true that humans will always despoil commons?So she went out and looked at what data she could find.She looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds,forestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case,humans destroyed the commons that they depended on.But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma;in fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma.And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.They escape by creating institutions for collective action.And she discovered, I think most interestingly,that among those institutions that worked,there were a number of common designprinciples, and those principles seem to bemissing from those institutions that don't work.I'm moving very quickly over a number ofdisciplines. In biology, the notions of symbiosis,group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure.But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact thatcooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central rolein biology, from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology.And again, our notions of individuals as economic beingshave been overturned.Rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor.In fact, people will act to punish cheaters, even at a cost to themselves.And most recently, neurophysiological measureshave shown that people who punish cheaters in economic gamesshow activity in the reward centers of their brain.Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishmentmay be the glue that holds societies together.Now, I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new mediain the past have helped create new economic forms.Commerce is ancient. Markets are very old. Capitalism is fairly recent;socialism emerged as a reaction to that.And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging.Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source,pointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production.I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperationenabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth,we may be moving into yet another economic formthat is significantly different from previous ones.Very briefly, let's look at some businesses. IBM, as you know, HP, Sun --some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcingtheir software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons.Eli Lilly -- in, again, the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world --has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems.Toyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace,treats them as a network and trains them to produce better,even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors.Now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism;they're doing it because they're learning thata certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest.Open source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla,can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firmnor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them.Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense.Amazon has opened its Application Programming Interfaceto 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops.They're enriching others, not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves.eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a marketwhere none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanismthat turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game.Instead of, "Neither of us can trust each other, so we have to make suboptimal moves,"it's, "You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate."Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopediawith a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years.We've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countriesto put up problems to be solved by design students around the world,including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now:it's a mechanism for rehydratingcholera victims that's so simple to use it,illiterates can be trained to use it.BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader,making the system more efficient the more it is used.Millions of people have contributed their desktop computerswhen they're not using them to link together through the Internetinto supercomputing collectivesthat help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers --that's Folding@home at Stanford --to crack codes, to search for life in outer space.I don't think we know enough yet.I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are,but I think we can begin to think about them.And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them,but think about self-interest.This is all about self-interest that adds up to more.In El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil wartook moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy.In the U.S., in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world,citizens have self-organized political protests andget out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS.Is an Apollo Project of cooperation possible?A transdisciplinary study of cooperation?I believe that the payoff would be very big.I think we need to begin developing maps of this territoryso that we can talk about it across disciplines.And I am not saying that understanding cooperationis going to cause us to be better people --and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things --but I will remind you that a few hundred years ago,people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thoughtwere caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits.Descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking.When the scientific method provided that new way of thinkingand biology showed that microorganisms caused disease,suffering was alleviated.What forms of suffering could be alleviated,what forms of wealth could be createdif we knew a little bit more about cooperation?I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourseis automatically going to happen;it's going to require effort.So I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started.Thank you.(Applause)

It's a simple idea about nature.I want to say a word for naturebecause we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days.I want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals,and tell you about a tool, a very simple tool that I have found.Although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit; it's not a technology.It's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural worldand to the other species on whom we depend.And that tool is very simply, as Chris suggested,looking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view.It's not my idea, other people have hit on it,but I've tried to take it to some new places.Let me tell you where I got it.Like a lot of my ideas, like a lot of the tools I use,I found it in the garden; I'm a very devoted gardener.And there was a day about seven years ago: I was planting potatoes,it was the first week of May --this is New England, when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom;they're just white clouds above.I was here, planting my chunks,cutting up potatoes and planting it,and the bees were working on this tree;bumblebees, just making this thing vibrate.And one of the things I really like about gardeningis that it doesn't take all your concentration,you really can't get hurt -- it's not like woodworking --and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation.And the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden,working alongside that bumblebee,was: what did I and that bumblebee have in common?How was our role in this garden similar and different?And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common:both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another,and both of us -- probably, if I can imagine the bee's point of view --thought we were calling the shots.I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant --I had picked my Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn, or whatever it was --and I had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country,brought it, and I was planting it.And that bee, no doubt, assumed that it had decided,"I'm going for that apple tree, I'm going for that blossom,I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave."We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are;that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me.I plant the potatoes, I weed the garden, I domesticate the species.But that day, it occurred to me:what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit?Because, of course, the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge,but we know better.We know that what's going on between the bee and that floweris that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower.And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits --color, scent, flavor, pattern -- that has lured that bee in.And the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar,and also picking up some powder on its leg,and going off to the next blossom.The bee is not calling the shots.And I realized then, I wasn't either.I had been seduced by that potato and not anotherinto planting its -- into spreading its genes, giving it a little bit more habitat.And that's when I got the idea, which was, "Well, what would happenif we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?"And agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention, not as a human technology,but as a co-evolutionary developmentin which a group of very clever species, mostly edible grasses, had exploited us,figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world.The competition of grasses, right?And suddenly everything looked different.And suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience.I had thought always -- and in fact, had written this in my first book;this was a book about gardening --that lawns were nature under culture's boot,that they were totalitarian landscapes,and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the speciesand never letting it set seed or die or have sex.And that's what the lawn was.But then I realized, "No, this is exactly what the grasses want us to do.I'm a dupe. I'm a dupe of the lawns, whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees,who they compete with for sunlight."And so by getting us to mow the lawn, we keep the trees from coming back,which in New England happens very, very quickly.So I started looking at things this wayand wrote a whole book about it called "The Botany of Desire."And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flowerand deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees --that they like sweetness, that they like this color and not that color, that they like symmetry --what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing?That a certain kind of potato, a certain kind of drug,a sativa-indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us.And that, wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world?Now, the test of any idea -- I said it was a literary conceit --is what does it get us?And when you're talking about nature, which is really my subject as a writer,how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test?Which is, does it make us better citizens of the biotic community?Get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota,rather than its destruction?And I would submit that this idea does this.So, let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way,besides some entertaining insights about human desire.As an intellectual matter, looking at the world from other species' points of viewhelps us deal with this weird anomaly,which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history --which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...Ugh. Mini-Me. (Laughter)We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin,we figured out we are just one species among many;evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others;we are acted upon as well as acting;we are really in the fiber, the fabric of life.But the weird thing is, we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later;none of us really believes this.We are still Cartesians -- the children of Descartes --who believe that subjectivity, consciousness, sets us apart;that the world is divided into subjects and objects;that there is nature on one side, culture on another.As soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view,you realize that the real literary conceit is that --is the idea that nature is opposed to culture,the idea that consciousness is everything --and that's another very important thing it does.Looking at the world from other species' points of viewis a cure for the disease of human self-importance.You suddenly realize that consciousness --which we value and we considerthe crowning achievement of nature,human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world.And it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool.But, you know, there's a comedian who said,"Well, who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important?Well, consciousness."So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other toolsand they're just as interesting.I'll give you two examples, also from the garden:lima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites?It releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the worldand summons another species of mitethat comes in and attacks the spider mite, defending the lima bean.So what plants have -- while we have consciousness, tool making, language,they have biochemistry.And they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine.Their complexity, their sophistication, is something to really marvel at,and I think it's really the scandal of the Human Genome Project.You know, we went into it thinking, 40,000 or 50,000 human genesand we came out with only 23,000.Just to give you grounds for comparison, rice: 35,000 genes.So who's the more sophisticated species?Well, we're all equally sophisticated.We've been evolving just as long,just along different paths.So, cure for self-importance, way to sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea.And that's really what I do as a writer, as a storyteller,is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actuallyhelp us think ecologically.Now, the other use of this is practical.And I'm going to take you to a farm right now,because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food systemand what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn.And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today,to me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense. (Laughter) (Applause)It is part of corn's scheme for world domination.(Laughter)And you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last yearand there will be that much more habitatbecause we've decided ethanol is going to help us.So it helped me understand industrial agriculture,which of course is a Cartesian system.It's based on this idea that we bend other species to our willand that we are in charge, and that we create these factoriesand we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of itor the fuel or whatever we want.Let me take you to a very different kind of farm.This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.I went looking for a farm where these ideasabout looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented,and I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin.And I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm,and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to naturethat I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature.And that is this:the farm is called Polyface, which means ...the idea is he's got six different species of animals, as well as some plants,growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement.It's permaculture, those of you who know a little bit about this,such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ...what else does he have?All the six different species -- rabbits, actually --are all performing ecological services for one another,such that the manure of one is the lunch for the otherand they take care of pests for one another.It's a very elaborate and beautiful dance,but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it,and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens, his laying hens.And I'll show you, if you take this approach, what you get, OK?And this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see;this is a different way to think about natureand a way to get away from the zero-sum notion,the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning,and that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.So, one day, cattle in a pen.The only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing:relatively new, hooked to a car battery;even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock, set it up in 15 minutes.Cows graze one day. They move, OK?They graze everything down, intensive grazing.He waits three days,and then we towed in something called the Eggmobile.The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption --it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards --but it houses 350 chickens.He tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank,turns them down, and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank --clucking, gossiping as chickens will --and they make a beeline for the cow patties.And what they're doing is very interesting:they're digging through the cow pattiesfor the maggots, the grubs, the larvae of flies.And the reason he's waited three daysis because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day, those larvae will hatchand he'll have a huge fly problem.But he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he canbecause they are the chickens' favorite form of protein.So the chickens do their kind of little breakdanceand they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs,and in the process they're spreading the manure out.Very useful second ecosystem service.And third, while they're in this paddockthey are, of course, defecating madlyand their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field.They then move out to the next one,and in the course of just a few weeks, the grass just enters this blaze of growth.And within four or five weeks, he can do it again.He can graze again, he can cut, he can bring in another species,like the lambs, or he can make hay for the winter.Now, I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there.So, it's a very productive system.And what I need to tell you is that on 100 acreshe gets 40,000 pounds of beef; 30,000 pounds of pork; 25,000 dozen eggs;20,000 broilers; 1,000 turkeys; 1,000 rabbits --an immense amount of food.You know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?"Well, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...again, give each species what it wants,let it realize its desires, its physiological distinctiveness.Put that in play.But look at it from the point of view of the grass, now.What happens to the grass when you do this?When a ruminant grazes grass, the grass is cut from this height to this height,and it immediately does something very interesting.Any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio,and plants need to keep the root massin some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy.So when they lose a lot of leaf mass, they shed roots;they kind of cauterize them and the roots die.And the species in the soil go to workbasically chewing through those roots, decomposing them --the earthworms, the fungi, the bacteria -- and the result is new soil.This is how soil is created.It's created from the bottom up.This is how the prairies were built,the relationship between bison and grasses.And what I realized when I understood this --and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is, he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer,he's not a sheep farmer, he's not a cattle rancher; he's a grass farmer,because grass is really the keystone species of such a system --is that, if you think about it, this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads,which is that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.More for us, less for nature.Here, all this food comes off this farm, and at the end of the seasonthere is actually more soil, more fertility and more biodiversity.It's a remarkably hopeful thing to do.There are a lot of farmers doing this today.This is well beyond organic agriculture,which is still a Cartesian system, more or less.And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species,take account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea-- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences,which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time --that we can take the food we need from the Earthand actually heal the Earth in the process.This is a way to reanimate the world,and that's what's so exciting about this perspective.When we really begin to feel Darwin's insights in our bones,the things we can do with nothing more than these ideasare something to be very hopeful about.Thank you very much.

I'm going to talk about two stories today.One is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demandand use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissionsin the transportation sector.And the other is that there is an incredible opportunityif we choose the right wireless technologies;how we can generate a new engine for economic growthand dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors.I'm really scared.We need to reduce C02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percentin order to avert catastrophic effects.And I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that.What are catastrophic effects? A three degree centigrade climate change risethat will result in 50 percent species extinction.It's not a movie. This is real life.And I'm really worried, because when people talk about cars-- which I know something about --the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking,"Let's use fuel-efficient cars."If we started today, 10 years from now, at the end of this window of opportunity,those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent.That is not enough.But now I'll talk about some more pleasant things.Here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes.So, Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago,but it's an example of something called car sharing.What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areasfor members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car.How does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar?It means that I pay only for what I need.All those hours when a car is sitting idle, I'm not paying for it.It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip.So, here's a woman that reserved MiniMia, and she had her day.I can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients.I can drive my Toyota Element when I'm going to go on that surfing trip.And the other remarkable thing is it's, I think, the highest status of car ownership.Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the worldthat I can have at my beck and call,but heaven forbid I would ever maintainor deal with the repair or have anything to do with it.It's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn't have.I get all the good stuff and none of the bad.So, what is the social result of this?The social result is that today's Zipcar has 100,000 membersdriving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces.Instead of driving 12,000 miles a year, which is what the average city dweller does,they drive 500 miles a year. Are they happy?The company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it, or greater.People adore the company. And it's better,you know? They like it.So, how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles?It's because they said, "It's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day.If I'm going to go buy some ice cream,do I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream? Or maybe I'll do without.Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand."So, people really respond very quickly to it, to prices.And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology.It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 secondsto reserve a car, go get it, drive it.And for me, as a service provider,I would never be able to provide you a car for an hourif the transaction cost was anything.So, without these wireless technologies, this, as a concept, could never happen.So, here's another example. This company is GoLoco --I'm launching it in about three weeks --and I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing.This will apply to people across all of America.Today, 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles,yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool.And I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systemsto completely change how people feel about ridesharingand make that trip much more efficient.And so when I think about the future,people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someoneis this incredibly great social event out of their day.You know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters.How fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car?How did you go food shopping? You went with your neighbor, what a great social time.You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel,and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility.Where can I go today and who can I do it with?Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel.And the social benefits:the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is, I told you, 75 percent;I think we can get that down to 50 percent.The demand for parking, of course, is down, congestion and the CO2 emissions.One last piece about this, of course, is that it's enabled by wireless technologies.And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this.The average American spends 19 percent of their income on their car,and there's a pressure for them to reduce that cost, yet they have no outlet today.So, the last example of this is congestion pricing, very famously done in London.It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads.In London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on,there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight,and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing.And again, do people like the outcome?Ken Livingstone was reelected.So again, we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingnessto reduce their driving behavior.We've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982.There's a huge slack in that system;with the right pricing we can undo that.Congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the worldand is, again, wirelessly enabled.You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of Londonand open and shut those gates.And what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trialfor something called road pricing.And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go,because today we pay for our maintenanceand wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes.And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient,that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes,so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive.Whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologieswill be happening with road pricing.Why do we travel too much?Car travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed.We need to put this better market feedback.And if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive,what mode of travel, where to live and work.And wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible.So, I want to move now to the second part of my story,which is: when are we going to start doingthis congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait10 to 15 years for this to happenor are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years?Because I'm going to say, that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight.And what kind of wireless technology are we going to use?This is my big vision.There is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide,respond to emergencies, get traffic moving,provide a new engine for economic growthand dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in every sector.And this is a moment from "The Graduate." Do you remember this moment?You guys are going to be the handsome young guyand I'm going to be the wise businessman."I want to say one word to you, just one word.""Yes, sir?" "Are you listening?" "Yes I am.""Ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks."(Laughter)These are also called mesh networks.And in a mesh, every device contributes to and expands the network,and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before.I'm going to give you some examples.You'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay.These laptops, when a child opens them up,they communicate with every single child in the classroom,within that school, within that village.And what is the cost of that communication system?Zero dollars a month.Here's another example: in New Orleans,video cameras were mesh-enabledso that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter.When the hurricane happened,the only communication system standing was the mesh network.Volunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices,and for the next 12 months,mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans.Another example is in Portsmouth, U.K.They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.You can look at the terminaland be able to see precisely where your bus is on the streetand when it's coming, and you can buy your tickets in real time.Again, all mesh-enabled. Monthly communication cost: zero.So, the beauty of mesh networks:you can have these very low-cost devices.Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable;you can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina,you can keep subtracting them -- as long as there's some, we can still communicate.They're resilient; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design.What are the incredible weaknesses?There isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen --or in those municipalities, to build out their cities with these wireless networks --because there's zero ongoing communications cost.So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks,and networks are interesting only as they are big.How do we create a big network?Are you guys ready again -- "The Graduate"?This time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman.These are the next two lines in the movie."Where did you do it?" "In his car."So you know, when you stick this idea ... (Laughter)where would we expect me, Robin Chase, to be thinkingis imagine if we put a mesh-network devicein every single car across America.We could have a coast-to-coast, free wireless communication system.I guess I just want you to think about that.And why is this going to happen? Because we're going to do congestion pricing,we are going to do road tolls,gas taxes are going to become road pricing.These things are going to happen.What's the wireless technology we're going to use?Maybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it?Maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen.We should pull it forward.So, I'd like us to launch the wireless Internet interstate wireless mesh system,and require that this network be accessible to everyone, with open standards.Right now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices --I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane --that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.What is the point?We're transferring just a few little data bitswhen we're doing road controlling, road pricing.We have this incredible excess capacity.So, we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast,we can have resilient nationwide communication systems,we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors.Imagine what happens when the cost of getting informationfrom anywhere to anywhere is close to zero.What you can do with that tool: we can create an economic engine.Information should be free, and access to information should be free,and we should be charging people for carbon.I think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act,and I think this is as important and world changingto our economy as electrification.And if I had my druthers,we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards.And this open-source version means thatit could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it --it could be used around the world very quickly.So, going back to one of my earlier thoughts.Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network.When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize-- his fabulous networks --imagine if there was an open-sourcemesh communications device that can be put into those networks,to make all that happen.And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact thatthis little slice of things is going to be for free.We could make billions of dollars on top of it,but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source.So, let's take control of this nightmare:implement a gas tax immediately;transition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh;require that the mesh be open to all, with open standards;and, of course, use mesh networks.Thank you.

chris_anderson_shares_his_vision_for_ted

This is your conference,and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period,about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit.So, I'm just going to grab a chair here.Two years ago at TED, I think --I've come to this conclusion --I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.I think that I may have believed unconsciously,then, that I was kind of a business hero.I had this company that I'd spent 15 years building. It's called Future;it was a magazine publishing company.It had recently gone publicand the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars,a number I didn't really understand.A magazine I'd recently launched called Business 2.0was fatter than a telephone directory,busy pumping hot air into the bubble.(Laughter)And I was the 40 percent owner of a dotcomthat was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more.And all this had come from nothing.Fifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed atwhen I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine."And 15 years later, there are 100 of themand 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times.The date was February 2000.I thought the little graph of my business lifethat kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law --ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever.I mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise.The dotcom, ironically called Snowball,was the very last consumer web company to go publicthe next month before NASDAQ exploded, and I entered 18 months of business hell.I watched everything that I'd built crumbling,and it looked like all this stuff was going to dieand 15 years work would have come for nothing.And it was gut wrenching.It took eight years of blood, sweat and tears to reach 350 employees,something which I was very proud of in the business.February 2001 -- in one day we laid off 350 people,and before the bloodshed was finished, 1,000 people had lost their jobsfrom my companies. I felt sick.I watched my own net worth fallingby about a million dollars a day, every day, for 18 months.And worse than that, far worse than that,my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating.I was going around with this big sign on my forehead: "LOSER."(Laughter)And I think what disgusts me more than anything, looking back,is how the hell did I let my personal happinessget so tied up with this business thing?Well, in the end, we were able to save Future and Snowball,but I was, at that point, ready to move on.And to cut a long story short, here's where I came to.And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe, from many conversations,that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster --emotional rollercoaster -- in the last couple years.This has been a big, big transition time,and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of usin taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next.The theme next year is re-birth.It was at the same TED two years agowhen Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED.And at about the same time, and I think partly because of that,I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus:I started to read again.And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games,there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest:cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropologyto ... all this stuff had changed.And the way in which you could think about us as a speciesand us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting.And what was really most exciting --and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did --was that all this stuff is connected.It's connected; it all hooks into each other.We talk about this a lot,and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example:Madame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president,was famously asked once, "What do you most desire?"And she answered, "A penis."And when you think about it, it's very true:what we all most desire is a penis --or "happiness" as we say in English.(Laughter)And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room.(Laughter)(Applause)But something as basic as happiness,which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussionin the church or mosque or synagogue,today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questionsthat you can ask about it, which are really interesting.You can ask about what causes it biochemically:neuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff.You can ask what are the psychological causes of it:nature? Nurture? Current circumstance?Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing.You can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem:do you need to incorporatesome sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly?You can view it in sort of geopolitical termsand say, why is it that a billion people on this planetare so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness,and whereas almost all the rest of them,regardless of how much money they have -- whether it's two dollars a day or whatever --are almost equally happy on average?Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing:did our genes invent this as a kind of trickto get us to behave in certain ways? The ant's brain, parasitized,to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate?Are we the victims of a mass delusion?And so on, and so on.To understand even something as important to us as happiness,you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions,and there's nowhere that I've discovered -- other than TED --where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions.And so, it's the profound thing that Richard talks about:to understand anything, you just need to understand the little bits;a little bit about everything that surrounds it.And so, gradually over these three days,you start off kind of trying to figure out,"Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff?"And at the end of the four days,your brain is humming and you feel energized, alive and excited,and it's because all these different bits have been put together.It's the total brain experience, we're going to ...it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.(Laughter)Every mental organ addressed. It really is.Enough of the theory, Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do, all right?So, I will. Here's the vision for TED.Number one: do nothing. This thing ain't broke, so I ain't gonna fix it.Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me,"Chris, TED is a really great conference.You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad."(Laughter)So, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason,and I will promise you right here and nowthat the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with.Truth, curiosity, diversity, no selling, no corporate bullshit,no bandwagoning, no platforms.Just the pursuit of interest, wherever it lies,across all the disciplines that are represented here.That's not going to be changed at all.Number two: I am going to put togetheran incredible line up of speakers for next year.The time scale on which TED operates is just fantasticafter coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines.There's a year to do this, and already --I hope to show you a bit later --there's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year.And I'm getting fantastic help from the community;this is just such a great community. And combined, our contactsreach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet.It's true.Number three: I do want to, if I can, find a wayof extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit.And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club.Books kind of saved me in the last couple years,and that's a gift that I would like to pass on.So, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care packagewith a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED.They may well be by a TED speaker,and so we can get the conversation going during the yearand come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey.I think it will be great.And then, fourthly: I want to mention the Sapling Foundation,which is the new owner of TED.What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TEDwill go towards the causes that Sapling stands for.And more important, I think, the ideas that are exhibited and realized hereare ideas that the foundation can use, because there's fantastic synergy.Already, just in the last few days,we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about,that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world,and the idea of getting this group of people together --some of the causes that we believe in,the money that this conference can raise and the ideas --I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference.I'm incredibly excited about that.In fact, I don't think, overall, that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life.I'm in this for the long run,and I would be greatly honored and excitedif you'll come on this journey with me.

Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning.Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments,and I realized that I almost became a scientist.When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry setand I decided to make water.(Laughter)So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator,and I had the two pipes leading into a beakerand I threw a match in.(Laughter)And the glass -- luckily I turned around --I had it all in my backand I was about 15 feet away.The wall was covered with ...I had an explosion.Richard Saul Wurman: Really?FG: People on the street came and knocked on the doorto see if I was okay.RSW: ... huh. (Laughter)I'd like to startthis session again.The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous,Frank Gehry.(Laughter)(Applause)And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect,to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at itbecause it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought,but your building is an icon --you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads --and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity statusin doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.And I know the road was extremely difficult.And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs,whatever they were, were very big.You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependenton working for somebody.But that's an interesting thing for a creative person.A lot of us work for people;we're in the hands of other people.And that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session --it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity:how to do work that's big enough and not sell out.And you've achieved thatand that makes your win doubly big, triply big.It's not quite a question but you can comment on it.It's a big issue.FG: Well, I've always just ...I've never really gone out looking for work.I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.And when I started out,I thought that architecture was a service businessand that you had to please the clients and stuff.And I realized when I'd come into the meetingswith these corrugated metal and chain link stuff,and people would just look at melike I'd just landed from Mars.But I couldn't do anything else.That was my response to the people in the time.And actually, it was responding to clients that I hadwho didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.I think it was circumstantial.Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monicaand for like 50 grand I built a house around it.And a few people got excited about it.I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer,out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.He's building this huge concrete place.And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.We were standing out in the desert all alone and,thinking about my house, he said,"Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent,somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?"(Laughter)So, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea."Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money,so the stuff was a little more permanent.But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long,this guy was telling us the other day.So where do we go now?Back to -- everything's so temporary.I don't see it the way you characterized it.For me, every day is a new thing.I approach each project with a new insecurity,almost like the first project I ever did,and I get the sweats,I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going --if I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it.When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.I discard it.So I approach it with the same trepidation.Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidencethat it's going to be OK.I do run a kind of a business --I've got 120 peopleand you've got to pay them,so there's a lot of responsibility involved --but the actual work on the project is with,I think, a healthy insecurity.And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him:you're not sure.When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it,I saw all the mistakes, I saw ...They weren't mistakes;I saw everything that I would have changedand I was embarrassed by it.I felt an embarrassment -- "How could I have done that?How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?"It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say --as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the roadand the street, and it appears to have a relationship --that I started to like it.RSW: What's the status of the New York project?FG: I don't really know.Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me,and I thought he was nuts.I didn't think he knew what he was doing,and he pulled it off.So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.(Laughter)He gets up there and then he ... comes back up.They're still talking about it.September 11 generated some interestin moving it over to Ground Zero,and I'm totally against that.I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground ZeroI think for a long time.RSW: The picture on the screen,is that Disney?FG: Yeah.RSW: How much further along is it than that,and when will that be finished?FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September, October --and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guyscome play with us at that place.Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasonsthat Disney Hall came to me.He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time.There aren't many people around that are really involvedwith architecture as clients.If you think about the world,and even just in this audience,most of us are involved with buildings.Nothing that you would call architecture, right?And so to find one, a guy like that,you hang on to him.He's become the head of Art Center,and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.I knew Craig and respected him.They want to add to itand it's hard to add to a building like that --it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building --and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuffand it's a lot of acreage.I convinced him to let me bring in another architectfrom Portugal: Alvaro Siza.RSW: Why did you want that?FG: I knew you'd ask that question.It was intuitive.(Laughter)Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugaland is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.I visited with him a few years agoand he showed me his early work,and his early work had a resemblance to my early work.When I came out of college,I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California,and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofsand things like that.I tried to understand that language as a beginning,as a place to jump off,and there was so much of it being done by spec buildersand it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ...I just stopped.I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it,but it didn't feel good to me.Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugalwhere the real stuff wasand evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.And I always felt that he should come to Southern Californiaand do a building.I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.I like the idea of collaboration with people like thatbecause it pushes you.I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra,who doesn't think architecture is art.Did you see that thing?RSW: No. What did he say?FG: He calls architecture "plumbing."(Laughter)FG: Anyway, the Siza thing.It's a richer experience.It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians --it's similar to that I would imagine --where you ... huh?Audience: Liquid architecture.FG: Liquid architecture.(Laughter)Where you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together,you play off each other, you make something,they make something.And I thinkfor me, it's a way of trying to understand the cityand what might happen in the city.RSW: Is it going to be near the current campus?Or is it going to be down near ...FG: No, it's near the current campus.Anyway, he's that kind of patron.It's not his money, of course.(Laughter)RSW: What's his schedule on that?FG: I don't know.What's the schedule, Richard?Richard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004.FG: 2004.You can come to the opening. I'll invite you.No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interestingbecause it creates chaos, right?Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment,and if you can figure out how to work off each other --if you can get a bunch of peoplewho respect each other's work and play off each other,you might be able to create models forhow to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect.Like the Rockefeller Center model,which is kind of from another era.RSW: I found the most remarkable thing.My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building,you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city.That was the surprise of going across the river,of going on the highway around it,of walking down the street and finding it.That was the real surprise of Bilbao.FG: But you know, Richard,most architects when they present their work --most of the people we know,you get up and you talk about your work,and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guyby saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context,I'm worried about the city,I'm worried about my client,I worry about budget, that I'm on time."Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff.And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ...by saying all that, it means your work is good somehow.And I think everybody --I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.You're not going to defy gravity.You've got to work with the building department.If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.If it leaks --Bilbao did not leak.I was so proud.(Laughter)The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MITand they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.I met them in Bilbao.They came for three days.RSW: This is the computer building?FG: Yeah, the computer building.They were there three days and it rained every dayand they kept walking around --I noticed they were looking under thingsand looking for things,and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know?People put buckets out ...I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place,it was just fantastic.But you've got to --yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ...(Laughter)RSW: Frank had a sort of ...FG: Ask Miriam!RW: ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while.(Laughter)FG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story,when the woman called and said,"Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couchand the water's pouring in on my head."And he said, "Madam, move your chair."(Laughter)So, some years later I was doing a building,a little house on the beach for Norton Simon,and his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady,called me and said,"Mr. Simon's sitting at his deskand the water's coming in on his head."And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story.RSW: Didn't get a laugh.FG: No. Not now either.(Laughter)But my point is that ... and I call it the "then what?"OK, you solved all the problems,you did all the stuff, you made nice,you loved your clients,you loved the city,you're a good guy, you're a good person ...and then what?What do you bring to it?And I think that's what I've always been interested in,is that -- which is a personal kind of expression.Bilbao, I think, shows that you can havethat kind of personal expressionand still touch all the bases that are necessaryof fitting into the city.That's what reminded me of it.And I think that's the issue, you know;it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects --most clients aren't hiring architects for that.They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget,be polite,and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people --when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ...FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.(Laughter)RSW: Did it leak?FG: No.(Laughter)RSW: ... people wanted a Michael Graves building.Is that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building?FG: Yeah.Since Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years,both Krens and I have been calledwith at least 100 opportunities --China, Brazil, other parts of Spain --to come in and do the Bilbao effect.And I've met with some of these people.Usually I say no right away,but some of them come with pedigreeand they sound well-intentionedand they get you for at least one or two meetings.In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a teambecause the thing was signed with seals and variousvery official seals from the city,and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port.I asked them what kind of building it was."When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah.So four of us went.And they took us -- they put us up in a great hoteland we were looking over the bay,and then they took us in a boat out in the waterand showed us all these sights in the harbor.Each one was more beautiful than the other.And then we were going to have lunch with the mayorand we were going to have dinner withthe most important people in Malaga.Just before going to lunch with the mayor,we went to the harbor commissioner.It was a table as long as this carpetand the harbor commissioner was here,and I was here, and my guys.We sat down, and we had a drink of waterand everybody was quiet.And the guy looked at me and said,"Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?"(Laughter)RSW: Oh, my God.FG: So, I got up.I said to my team,"Let's get out of here."We stood up, we walked out.They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said,"You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?"I said, "Nope.""You're not going to have dinner at all?"They just brought us there to hustle this group,you know, to create a project.And we get a lot of that.Luckily, I'm old enough thatI can complain I can't travel.(Laughter)I don't have my own plane yet.RSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meetingbecause it's been very long.But let me just say a couple words.FG: Can I say something?Are you going to talk about me or you?(Laughter)(Applause)RSW: Once a shit, always a shit!FG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ...RSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one!(Laughter)I'm going to make it for you!FG: No, no. Wait a minute!(Applause)

The old story about climate protection is that it's costly,or it would have been done already.So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it.The new story about climate protectionis that it's not costly, but profitable.This was a simple sign error,because it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel,as is well known to companies that do it all the time --for example, Dupont, SD micro electronics.Many other firms -- IBM -- are reducing their energy intensityroutinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants,and they get their money back in two or three years.That's called a profit.Now, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it,it would be expensive, or we would have done it already,because markets are essentially perfect.If, of course, that were true, there would be no innovation,and nobody could make any money.But the new story about oilis the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil --not just incrementally, but completely --quite the contrary. The United States, for example,can completely eliminate its use of oiland rejuvenate the economy at the same time,led by business for profit,because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oilthan to keep on buying it.This process will also be catalyzed by the militaryfor its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict,particularly over oil.This thesis is set out in a book called "Winning the Oil Endgame"that four colleagues and I wroteand have posted for free at Oilendgame.com --about 170,000 downloads so far.And it was co-sponsored by the Pentagon --it's independent, it's peer-reviewedand all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal.Now, a bit of economic history, I think, may be helpful here.Around 1850, one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling.And whale oil lit practically every building.But in the nine years before Drake struck oil, in 1859,at least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared,thanks to fatal competitors, chiefly oil and gas made from coal,to which the whalers had not been paying attention.So, very unexpectedly, they ran out of customersbefore they ran out of whales.The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovatorsand profit-maximizing capitalists.(Laughter)And it's funny -- it feels a bit like this now for oil.We've been spending the last few decadesaccumulating a very powerful backlog of technologiesfor saving and substituting for oil,and no one had bothered to add them up before.So when we did, we found some very surprising things.Now, there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil.Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk.On the competitiveness front,we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together.And serious competition from Europe, from Korea,and next is China, which will soon be a major net exporter of cars.How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your newwally-badged Shanghai automotive super-efficient car?Maybe a decade, according to my friends in Detroit.China has an energy policybased on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology.They're not going to export your uncle's Buick.And after that comes India.The point here is, these cars are going to be made super efficient.The question is, who will make them?Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil,or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars?That seems to make more sense.The more we keep on using the oil, particularly the imported oil,the more we face a very obvious array of problems.Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing,but nothing is not the right number.It could well be enough to double the oil price, for example.And one of the worst of theseis what it does to our standing in the worldif other countries think that everything we do is about oil,if we have to treat countries that have oildifferently than countries that don't have oil.And our military get quite unhappywith having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istanwhen what they actually signed up forwas to protect American citizens.They don't like fighting over oil,they don't like being in the sandsand they don't like where the oil money goesand what sort of instability it creates.Now, in order to avoid these problems,whatever you think they're worth, it's actually not that complicated.We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently,at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel.And then we can replace the other halfwith a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas.And that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel.And compared with the official forecast,that oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025,which is half of what we've been paying lately,that will save 70 billion dollars a year, starting quite soon.Now, in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars:half of it to retool the car, truck and plane industries;half of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry.In the process, we will gain about a million good jobs, mainly rural.And protect another million jobs now at risk, mainly in auto-making.And we'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year.So that's a very handsome return.It's financeable in the private capital market.But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned,to happen sooner and with higher confidence,then -- and also to expand choice and manage risk --then you might like some light-handed public policiesthat support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic.And these policies work fine without taxes, subsidies or mandates.They make a little net money for the treasury.They have a broad trans-ideological appeal,and because we want them actually to happen,we figured out ways to do themthat do not require much, if any, federal legislation,and can, indeed, be done administratively or at a state level.Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem,namely, light vehicles,here are four ultra-light carbon-composite concept cars with low drag,and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive.You can sort of have it all with these things.For example, this Opel two-seaterdoes 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon.This muscle car from Toyota: 408 horsepower in an ultra-lightthat does zero to 60 in well under four seconds,and still gets 32 miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this.And in the upper left, a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM --84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid, in a four-seater.Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehiclescosts about 57 cents per saved gallon.But it's even a better deal for heavy trucks,where you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon,with better aerodynamics and tires and engines, and so on,and taking out weight so you can put it into payload.So you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return.Then you can go even further, almost tripling efficiencywith some operational improvements,double the big haulers' margins.And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull, and flip the market.In the airplane business, it's again a similar storywhere the first 20 percent fuel saving is free,as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner.But then the next generation of planes saves about half.Again, much cheaper than buying the fuel.And if you go over the next 15 years or so to a blended-wing body,kind of a flying wing with internal engines,then you get about a factor three efficiency improvementat comparable or lower cost.Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles, the cars and light trucks,because we all know the most about those;probably everybody here drives one.And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan,of all the fuel energy you feed into the car,seven-eighths never gets to the wheels;it's lost first in the engine, idling at zero miles a gallon,the power train and accessories.So then of the energy that does get to the wheels,only an eighth of it, half of that, goes to heat the tires on the road,or to heat the air the car pushes aside.And only this little bit, only six percentactually ends up accelerating the carand then heating the brakes when you stop.In fact, since 95 percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver,less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver.This is not very gratifyingafter more than a century of devoted engineering effort.(Laughter)(Applause)Moreover, three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car.And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheelsis going to avoid wasting another seven units of energygetting that energy to the wheels.So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter.And the reason this has not been very seriously examined beforeis there was a common assumption in the industry that --well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car,and it would cost a lot more to make,because the only way we know how to make cars much lighterwas to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium.But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials.For example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber compositesin sporting goods.And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety.Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf.The Golf was totaled.The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel.They'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later.But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour,the entire crash energy would be absorbedby a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones,weighing a total of 15 pounds, hidden in the front end.Because these materials could actually absorbsix to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel,and do so a lot more smoothly.And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight.We could make cars bigger, which is protective, but make them light.Whereas if we made them heavy, they'd be both hostile and inefficient.And when you make them light in the right way,that can be simpler and cheaper to make.You can end up saving money, and lives, and oil, all at the same time.I showed here two years agoa little bit about a design of your basic, uncompromised,quintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicle --(Laughter)-- and this is a complete virtual designthat is production-costed manufacturable.And the process needed to make itis actually coming toward the market quite nicely.We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printerfor this very stiff, strong, carbon-composite material,and then ways to thermoform it,because it's a combination of carbon and nylon,into whatever complex shapes you want,like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier-one suppliers.And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified.Because the auto body has only, say, 14 parts, instead of 100, 150.Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set,instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel.Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist.They snap together like a kid's toy.So you got rid of the body shop.And if you want, you can lay color in the mold, and get rid of the paint shop.Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car.So you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensitythan the leanest plant in the industry, which GM has in Lansing.The plant also gets smaller.Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil,including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on,you find that of the 28 million barrels a daythe government says we will need in 2025,well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then,with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over,at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel,instead of 26 for buying the oil.And then another six can be made robustly, competitively,from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel,without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production.There is a huge amount of gas to be saved,about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price.And here are some no-brainer substitutions of it, with lots left over.So much, in fact, that after you've handled the domestic oil forecastfrom areas already approved,you have only this little bit left, and let's see how we can meet that,because there's a pretty flexible menu of ways.We could, of course, buy more efficiency.Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12.Or wait to capture the second half of it.Or we could, of course, just get this little bitby continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil,or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us.But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead,because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers, and they don't.Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance,or if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient,we'd get rid of the domestic oil too.And that doesn't even count, for example,that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectivelymake enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country.So we have lots of options.And the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible.Now, to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence,there is a few ways government could help.For example, fee-bates, a combination of a fee and a rebatein any size class of vehicle you want,can increase the price of inefficient vehiclesand correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles.You're not paid to change size class.You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class,in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savingsrather than just the first two or three.This expands choice rapidly in the market,and actually makes more money for automakers as well.I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this countryby making it very cheaply possible for low-income familiesto get efficient, reliable, warranted new carsthat they could otherwise never get.And for each car so financed, scrap almost one clunker,preferably the dirtiest ones.This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroitfrom customers they weren't going to get otherwise,because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car.And Detroit will make money on every unit.It turns out that if, say, African-American and white householdshad the same car ownership,it would cut employment disparity about in halfby providing better access to job opportunities.So this is a huge social win, too.Governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year.There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing powerto bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster.And we could even do an X Prize-style golden carrotthat's worth stretching further for.For example, a billion-dollar prize for the first U.S. automakerto sell 200,000 really advanced vehicles, like some you saw earlier.Then the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planesthey desperately need to cut their fuel bills,but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that,there are ways to finance it.And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes,so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air,they would waste more oil,and block the uptake of efficient, new planes.Those part inefficient planesare worth more to society dead than alive.We ought to take them out back and shoot them,and put bounty hunters after them.Then there's an important military role.That in creating the move to high-volume,low-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials,or for that matter, ultra-light steelsthat are a good backup technology,the military can do the trick it didin turning DARPAnet into the Internet.Just turn it over to the private sector, and we have an Internet.The same for GPS.The same for the modern semi-conductor industry.That is, military science and technology that they needcan create the advanced materials-industrial clusterthat transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil,which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oiland advancing national and global security.Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining,and shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chainsto shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates,and get out of our own way in other ways.And make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster.But here's how the whole thing fits together.Instead of official forecasts of oil useand oil imports going forever up,they can turn down with the 12 dollars a barrel efficiency,down steeply by adding the supply-side substitutions at 18 bucks,all implemented at slower rates than we've done before when we paid attention.And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there,we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s.And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before.In this eight-year period, 1977 to 85, when we last paid attention,the economy grew 27 percent, oil use fell 17 percent,oil imports fell 50 percent, oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell 87 percent.They would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year.Well, that was with very old technologies and delivery methods.We could rerun that play a lot better now.And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC.Ours is on the demand side.We are the Saudi Arabia of "nega-barrels." (Laughter)We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil.(Applause)Whatever your reason for wanting to do this,whether you're concerned about national security or price volatility --(Laughter)-- or jobs, or the planet, or your grand-kids,it seems to me that this is an oil endgamethat we should all be playing to win.Please download your copy, and thank you very much.(Applause)

What is bioenergy? Bioenergy is not ethanol.Bioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy issomething which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergyis oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of buildingthat bridge to the future, to the point where wecan actually see the oceans in a rational way, orput up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl ordo microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on howwe understand bioenergy and manage it. And to dothat, you really have to look first at agriculture.So we've been planting stuff for 11,000 years. Andin the measure that we plant stuff, what we learnfrom agriculture is you've got to deal with pests,you've got to deal with all types of awful things,you've got to cultivate stuff. In the measurethat you learn how to use water to cultivate, thenyou're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.You're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigationmakes a difference.Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plantstuff where you want it, as opposed to where therivers flood. You start getting this organicagriculture; you start putting machinery onto thisstuff. Machinery, with a whole bunch of water,leads to very large-scale agriculture.You put together machines and water, and you getlandscapes that look like this. And then you getsales that look like this. It's brute force. Sowhat you've been doing in agriculture is you startout with something that's a reasonably naturalsystem. You start taming that natural system. Youput a lot of force behind that natural system. Youput a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides --(Laughter) -- behind that natural system, and youend up with systems that look like this.And it's all brute force. And that's the way we'vebeen approaching energy. So the lesson inagriculture is that you can actually change thesystem that's based on brute force as you startmerging that system and learning that system andactually applying biology. And you move from adiscipline of engineering, you move from adiscipline of chemistry, into a discipline ofbiology. And probably one of the most importanthuman beings on the planet is this guy behind me.This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won theNobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal ofHonor. He deserves all of this stuff. And hedeserves this stuff because he probably has fedmore people than any other human being alivebecause he researched how to put biology behindseeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why Indiaand China no longer have these massive famines isbecause Norman Borlaug taught them how to growgrains in a more efficient way and launched theGreen Revolution. That is something that a lot ofpeople have criticized. But of course, those arepeople who don't realize that China and India,instead of having huge amounts of starving people,are exporting grains.And the irony of this particular system is theplace where he did the research, which was Mexico,didn't adopt this technology, ignored thistechnology, talked about why this technologyshould be thought about, but not really applied.And Mexico remains one of the largest grainimporters on the planet because it doesn't applytechnology that was discovered in Mexico. And infact, hasn't recognized this man, to the pointwhere there aren't statues of this man all overMexico. There are in China and India. And theInstitute that this guy ran has now moved toIndia. That is the difference between adoptingtechnologies and discussing technologies.Now, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amountof people in the world. It's that this is the neteffect in terms of what technology does, if youunderstand biology.What happened in agriculture? Well, if you takeagriculture over a century, agriculture in about1900 would have been recognizable to somebodyplanting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows lookdifferent. The machines were tractors or stuffinstead of mules, but the farmer would haveunderstood: this is what the guy's doing, this iswhy he's doing it, this is where he's going. Whatreally started to change in agriculture is whenyou started moving from this brute forceengineering and chemistry into biology, and that'swhere you get your productivity increases. And asyou do that stuff, here's what happens toproductivity.Basically, you go from 250 hours to produce 100bushels, to 40, to 15, to five. Agricultural laborproductivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000,whereas the rest of the economy increased about2.5 times. This is an absolutely massive increasein how much is produced per person.The effect of this, of course, is it's not justamber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.And 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidizeagriculture from mountains of stuff that peoplehave overproduced.This would be a good outcome for energy. And ofcourse, by now, you're probably saying toyourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk aboutenergy and here's this guy talking about biology."So where's the link between these two things?One of the ironies of this whole system is we'rediscussing what to do about a system that we don'tunderstand. We don't even know what oil is. Wedon't know where oil comes from. I mean,literally, it's still a source of debate whatthis black river of stuff is and where it comesfrom. The best assumption, and one of the bestguesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comesout of this stuff, that these things absorbsunlight, rot under pressure for millions ofyears, and you get these black rivers.Now, the interesting thing about that thesis -- ifthat thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil,and all hydrocarbons, turned out to beconcentrated sunlight. And if you think ofbioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy istaking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas,concentrating it in plants, and maybe that's whyyou get these rainbows.And as you're looking at this system, ifhydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, thenbioenergy works in a different way. And we've gotto start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons aspart of these solar panels.Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you flyover west Texas, the types of wells that you'rebeginning to see don't look unlike those picturesof Kansas and those irrigated plots.This is how you farm oil. And as you think offarming oil and how oil has evolved, we startedwith this brute force approach. And then what didwe learn? Then we learned we had to go bigger. Andthen what'd we learn? Then we have to go evenbigger. And we are getting really destructive aswe're going out and farming this bioenergy.These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's anenormous amount -- first of mining, the largesttrucks in the world are working here, and thenyou've got to pull out this black sludge, which isbasically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to thesand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam toseparate it, which only works at today's oilprices.Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the samestuff. It is probably plants, except that thesehave been burned and crushed under pressure.So you take something like this, you burn it, youput it under pressure, and likely as not, you getthis. Although, again, I stress: we don't know.Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. Butas you think of coal, this is what burned wheatkernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal.And of course, coalmines are very dangerousplaces because in some of these coalmines, youget gas. When that gas blows up, people die. Soyou're producing a biogas out of coal in somemines, but not in others.Any place you see a differential, there're someinteresting questions. There's some questions asto what you should be doing with this stuff. Butagain, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the samesystem, maybe bioenergy, and you're applyingexactly the same technology.Here's your brute force approach. Once you getthrough your brute force approach, then you justrip off whole mountaintops. And you end up withthe single largest source of carbon emissions,which are coal-fired gas plants. That is probablynot the best use of bioenergy.As you think of what are the alternatives to thissystem -- it's important to find alternativesbecause it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling inits petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling inits coal reserves, nor is China. There are hugecoal reserves that are sitting out there, andwe've got to start thinking of them as biologicalenergy, because if we keep treating them aschemical energy, or engineering energy, we'regoing to be in deep doo-doo.Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biologicalproduct. And as you think of gas, well, you'refamiliar with gas. And here's a different way ofmining coal.This is called coal bed methane. Why is thispicture interesting? Because if coal turns out tobe concentrated plant life, the reason why you mayget a differential in gas output between one mineand another -- the reason why one mine may blow upand another one may not blow up -- may be becausethere's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.This is a well-known phenomenon. (Laughter) Youeat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. Itmay turn out that biological processes in coalmineshave the same process. If that is true, thenone of the ways of getting the energy out of coalmay not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and itmay not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuffprocess that coal in a biological fashion as youdid in agriculture.That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. Itis not subsidies to a few companies. It is notimporting corn into Iowa because you've built somany of these ethanol plants. It is beginning tounderstand the transition that occurred inagriculture, from brute force into biologicalforce. And in the measure that you can do that,you can clean some stuff, and you can clean itpretty quickly.We already have some indicators of productivity onthis stuff. OK, if you put steam into coal fieldsor petroleum fields that have been running fordecades, you can get a really substantialincrease, like an eight-fold increase, in youroutput. This is just the beginning stages of thisstuff.And as you think of biomaterials, this guy -- whodid part of the sequencing of the human genome,who just doubled the databases of genes andproteins known on earth by sailing around theworld -- has been thinking about how you structurethis. And there's a series of smart peoplethinking about this. And they've been puttingtogether companies like Synthetic Genomics, like,a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies aretrying to do is to think of, how do you applybiological principles to avoid brute force?Think of it in the following terms. Think of it asbeginning to program stuff for specific purposes.Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of thegenes as a software. And in the measure that youbegin to think of life as code that isinterchangeable, that can become energy, that canbecome food, that can become fiber, that canbecome human beings, that can become a wholeseries of things, then you've got to shift yourapproach as to how you're going to structure anddeal and think about energy in a very differentway.What are the first principles of this stuff andwhere are we heading? This is one of the gentlegiants on the planet. He's one of the nicest humanbeings you've ever met. His name is HamiltonSmith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how tocut genes -- something called restriction enzymes.He was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's sucha modest guy that the day he won, his mothercalled him and said, "I didn't realize there wasanother Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he justwon the Nobel?" (Laughter) I mean, that was Mom,but anyway, this guy is just a class act. You findhim at the bench every single day, working on apipette and building stuff. And one of the thingsthis guy just built are these things.What is this? This is the first transplant ofnaked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operatingsystem out of one cell, insert it into a differentcell, and have that cell boot up as a separatespecies. That's one month old. You will see stuffin the next month that will be just as importantas this stuff.And as you think about this stuff and what theimplications of this are, we're going to start notjust converting ethanol from corn with very highsubsidies. We're going to start thinking aboutbiology entering energy. It is very expensive toprocess this stuff, both in economic terms and inenergy terms.This is what accumulates in the tar sands ofAlberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as youseparate that petroleum from the sand, and use anenormous amount of energy inside that vapor --steam to separate this stuff -- you also have toseparate out the sulfur. The difference betweenlight crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14bucks a barrel. That's why you're building thesepyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, thescale on these things is pretty large.Now, if you can take part of the energy contentout of doing this, you reduce the system, and youreally do start applying biological principles toenergy. This has to be a bridge to the point whereyou can get to wind, to the point where you canget to solar, to the point where you can get tonuclear -- and hopefully you won't build the nextnuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to anearthquake fault. (Laughter) Just a thought.But in the meantime, for the next decade at least,the name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be thatoil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we'redealing with. And before I make this talk toolong, here's what's happening in the currentenergy system.86 percent of the energy we consume arehydrocarbons. That means 86 percent of the stuff we'reconsuming are probably processed plants andamoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's arole in here for conservation. There's a role inhere for alternative stuff, but we've also got toget that other portion right.How we deal with that other portion is our bridgeto the future. And as we think of this bridge tothe future, one of the things you should ponderis: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil todayinside those wells. So we're spending an enormousamount of money and leaving most of the energydown there. Which, of course, requires more energyto go out and get energy. The ratios becomeidiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It mayeven be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input andthe energy output. That is a stupid way ofmanaging this system.Last point, last graph. One of the things thatwe've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. Thisis what oil prices look like, OK?This is a very bad system because what happens isyour hurdle rate gets set very low. People come upwith really smart ideas for solar panels, or forwind, or for something else, and then guess what?The oil price goes through the floor. That companygoes out of business, and then you can bring theoil price back up.So if I had one closing and modest suggestion,let's set a stable oil price in Europe and theUnited States. How do you do that? Well, let's puta tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and itbasically says for the next 20 years, the price ofoil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that, we taxit. If the OPEC price goes above that, the taxgoes away.What does that do for entrepreneurs? What does itdo for companies? It tells people, if you canproduce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, orless than 40 bucks a barrel, or less than 50 bucksa barrel -- let's debate it -- you will have abusiness. But let's not put people through thiscycle where it doesn't pay to research becauseyour company will go out of business as OPECdrives alternatives and keeps bioenergy fromhappening. Thank you.

You've all seen lots of articles on climate change,and here's yet another New York Times article,just like every other darn one you've seen.It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen.It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen.What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953.And the reason I'm saying thisis that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent.That people have just sort of figured out about it, and nowwith Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something,we may be on the road to a solution.The fact is -- uh-uh.We've known about this problem for 50 years, depending on how you count it.We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so.And we've accomplished close to zip.This is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere.You've seen this in various forms,but maybe you haven't seen this one.What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.And that it's accelerating even fasterthan what we thought was the worst case just a few years back.So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics saidthe environmentalists only put in the projectionsto make the projections look as bad as possible,that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line.But in fact, they're growing faster.Here's some data from actually just 10 days ago,which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice, and it's the lowest by far.And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models.So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet andburning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties --in fact, you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative,because it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel. (Laughter)No, no! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes onthis very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we've really hardly started.Really, we're doing this, basically. Really, not very much.I don't want to depress you too much.The problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap.Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care.Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP.No, this is really important to have this sense of scale.So the problem is soluble, and the way we should go about solving it is, say,dealing with electricity production,which causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions.And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation,and wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture,which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work.All we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place.Instead, we spend our time talking.But nevertheless, that's not what I'm going to talk to you about tonight.What I'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing.And it's this stuff in the middle here, which is what you doif you don't stop the emissions quickly enough.And you need to deal -- somehow break the link between human actionsthat change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly importantbecause, of course, while we can adapt to climate change --and it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change.Oh, yes, I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it.But one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers.But, of course, the natural world, polar bears.I spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic.They will completely lose.And there's no adaption.So this problem is absolutely soluble.This geo-engineering idea, in it's simplest form, is basically the following.You could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates --into the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet.And I know for certain that that will work.Not that there aren't side effects, but I know for certain it will work.And the reason is, it's been done.And it was done not by us, not by me, but by nature.Here's Mount Pinatubo in the early '90s. That put a whole bunch of sulfurin the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud.The result of that was pretty dramatic.After that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you seea quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere.So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,and it heats up after these volcanoes.But you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphereand the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.There's no big mystery about it.There's lots of mystery in the details, and there's some bad side effects,like it partially destroys the ozone layer -- and I'll get to that in a minute.But it clearly cools down.And one other thing: it's fast.It's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do,like slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes timeto build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions.And not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations,because concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air,is the sum of emissions over time.So you can't step on the brakes very quickly.But if you do this, it's quick.And there are times you might like to do something quick.Another thing you might wonder about is, does it work?Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2,and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally?And the answer seems to be yes.So here are the graphs you've seen lots of times before.That's what the world looks like, under one particular climate model's view,with twice the amount of CO2 in the air.The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight,and you're back to the original climate.And this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came, becauseKen -- at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid-'90s --Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said,"Geo-engineering won't work."And to the person who was promoting it said,"The atmosphere's much more complicated."Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation.Ken went and ran his models, and found that it did.This topic is also old.That report that landed on President Johnson's desk when I was two years old --1965.That report, in fact, which had all the modern climate science --the only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering.It didn't even talk about cutting emissions,which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem.I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions.We should, but it made exactly this point.So, in a sense, there's not much new.The one new thing is this essay.So I should say, I guess, that since the time of that original President Johnson report,and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy --1977, 1982, 1990 -- people always talked about this idea.Not as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about.But when climate became, politically, a hot topic -- if I may make the pun --in the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it.It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it.But in the last year, Paul Crutzen published this essaysaying roughly what's all been said before: that maybe, given our very slow rateof progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts,we should think about things like this.He said roughly what's been said before.The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry.And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this,even though there will be some ozone impacts.And in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away.There was all sorts of press coverage, all over the world,going right down to "Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth," from the Economist.And that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off,but not so much technically. And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night.And I thought about this child's toy -- hence, the title of my talk --and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'roundin the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphereand make them stay there.One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly.The other problem is they're right in the ozone layer,and I'd prefer them above the ozone layer.And it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this.It was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped.But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already publishedthat addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere.So it seems there are already fine particlesthat are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up,that already have this effect.I'll tell you very quickly how the effect works.There are a lot of fun complexitiesthat I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't.But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated.So the side facing the sun is warmer; the side away, cooler.Gas molecules that bounce off the warm sidebounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm.And so you see a net force away from the sun.That's called the photophoretic force.There are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaboratorshave thought about how to exploit.And of course, we may be wrong --this hasn't all been peer reviewed, we're in the middle of thinking about it --but so far, it seems good.But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes --much longer than before -- because they're levitated.We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere,in principle solving the ozone problem.I'm sure there will be other problems that arise.Finally, we could make the particles migrate to over the poles,so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles.Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet,where we live, and do the maximum job of what we might need to do,which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency, if you like.This is a new idea that's crept up that may be, essentially,a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in.Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right,I think it's almost certain we willeventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in.That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this,it's amazing how we can affect the planet.The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage.This improved science and engineering will, whether we like it or not,give us more and more leverage to affect the planet,to control the planet,to give us weather and climate control -- not because we plan it,not because we want it, just because science delivers it to us bit by bit,with better knowledge of the way the system worksand better engineering tools to effect it.Now, suppose that space aliens arrived.Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here,or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot --but suppose they arrive and they give you a box.And the box has two knobs.One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature.Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations.You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box.Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs.We have no global governance.And different people will have different places they want it set.Now, I don't think that's going to happen. It's not very likely.But we're building that box.The scientists and engineers of the worldare building it piece by piece, in their labs.Even when they're doing it for other reasons.Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment.They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet.They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do.And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it -- I do not --but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously.Because sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this,and it's better if we think hard about it,even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it.I'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginningof my thinking about how to think about it.But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this.We need a broader debate.A debate that involves musicians, scientists, philosophers, writers,who get engaged with this question about climate engineeringand think seriously about what its implications are.So here's one way to think about it,which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper.I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap.It's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with,you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP.It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage.It's not a good idea, but it's just important. (Laughter)I'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big.And that calculation isn't much in dispute.You might argue about the sanity of it, but the leverage is real. (Laughter)So because of this, we could deal with the problemsimply by stopping reducing emissions,and just as the concentrations go up, we can increasethe amount of geo-engineering.I don't think anybody takes that seriously.Because under this scenario, we walk further and further awayfrom the current climate.We have all sorts of other problems, like ocean acidificationthat come from CO2 in the atmosphere, anyway.Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this.But here's a case which is harder to reject.Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do,which is get serious about cutting emissions.But we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them.There's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much.So let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes,but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissionsand eventually reduce concentrations.And maybe someday -- like 2075, October 23 --we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peakedand are rolling down the other side.And we have global celebrations, and we've actually started to -- you know,we've seen the worst of it.But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheetis really melting unacceptably fast, fast enough to put meters of sea level onthe oceans in the next 100 years,and remove some of the biggest cities from the map.That's an absolutely possible scenario.We might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertainand morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering.And that's a very different way to look at the problem.It's using this as risk control, not instead of action.It's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little whileto take the worst of the heat off, not that you'd use it as a substitute for action.But there is a problem with that view.And the problem is the following:knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makesthe climate impacts look less fearsome,and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today.This is what economists call a moral hazard.And that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about,and, in general, I think it's the underlying reasonthat it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this.But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer.I'll leave you with three questions, and then one final quote.Should we do serious research on this topic?Should we have a national research program that looks at this?Not just at how you would do it better,but also what all the risks and downsides of it are.Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side,some in a negative side -- but that's a dangerous state to be inbecause there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic.A very small amount of money would get us some.Many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that.But I have a lot of reservations.My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem,and I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard.I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this,people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.Another thing is, maybe we need a treaty.A treaty that decides who gets to do this.Right now we may think of a big, rich country like the U.S. doing this.But it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizesthat the climate impacts are just unacceptable,they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this,and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered worldthan a non-geo-engineered world.And we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision.So here's one last thought, which was said much, much better25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today.And I think it really summarizes where we are here.That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about,is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologiesthat will reduce emissions --but also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climateand weather control, whether we like it or not.And it's time to begin thinking about it,even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct argumentsfor why we shouldn't do it.Thank you very much.

(Applause)I want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content.I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argumentthat's going to tell you a little bitabout how we open user-generated content up for business.So, here's the first story.1906. This man, John Philip Sousa, traveled to this place,the United States Capitol, to talk about this technology,what he called the, quote, "talking machines."Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines.This is what he had to say."These talking machines are going to ruin artistic developmentof music in this country.When I was a boy, in front of every house in the summer evenings,you would find young people togethersinging the songs of the day, or the old songs.Today, you hear these infernal machines going night and day.We will not have a vocal chord left," Sousa said."The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolutionas was the tail of man when he came from the ape."Now, this is the picture I want you to focus on.This is a picture of culture.We could describe it using modern computer terminologyas a kind of read-write culture.It's a culture where people participate in the creationand the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacitybecause of these, quote, "infernal machines." They would take it away.And in its place, we'd have the opposite of read-write culture,what we could call read-only culture.Culture where creativity was consumedbut the consumer is not a creator.A culture which is top-down, owned,where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost.Now, as you look back at the twentieth century,at least in what we think of as the, quote, "developed world" --hard not to conclude that Sousa was right.Never before in the history of human culturehad it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.Never before has creativity of the millionsbeen as effectively displaced,and displaced because of these, quote, "infernal machines."The twentieth century was that centurywhere, at least for those places we know the best,culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence.So, second. Land is a kind of property --it is property. It's protected by law.As Lord Blackstone described it, land is protected by trespass law,for most of the history of trespass law,by presuming it protects the land all the way down belowand to an indefinite extent upward.Now, that was a pretty good systemfor most of the history of the regulation of land,until this technology came along, and people began to wonder,were these instruments trespassersas they flew over land without clearing the rightsof the farms below as they traveled across the country?Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question.Two farmers, Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby, who raised chickens,had a significant complaint because of these technologies.The complaint was that theirchickens followed the pattern of the airplanesand flew themselves into the walls of the barnwhen the airplanes flew over the land.And so they appealed to Lord Blackstoneto say these airplanes were trespassing.Since time immemorial, the law had said,you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner,so this flight must stop.Well, the Supreme Court considered this 100-years traditionand said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas,that the Causbys must lose.The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting landall the way to the sky has no place in the modern world,otherwise every transcontinental flight wouldsubject the operator to countless trespass suits.Common sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was. Common sense --(Laughter) --Revolts at the idea. Common sense.Finally. Before the Internet, the last great terrorto rain down on the content industrywas a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting:a new way to spread content,and therefore a new battle over the controlof the businesses that would spread content.Now, at that time, the entity,the legal cartel, that controlled the performance rightsfor most of the music that would be broadcastusing these technologies was ASCAP.They had an exclusive license on the most popular content,and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrateto the broadcasters who really was in charge.So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent,until the broadcasters finally got togetherand said, okay, enough of this.And in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started somethingcalled Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.And BMI was much more democratic in the artthat it would include within its repertoire,including African American music for the first time in the repertoire.But most important was that BMI took public domain worksand made arrangements of them, which they gave away for freeto their subscribers. So that in 1940,when ASCAP threatened to double their rates,the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI.Now, ASCAP said they didn't care.The people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best musicwas no longer available, because they had shiftedto the second best public domain provided by BMI.Well, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked.And the important point to recognizeis that even though these broadcasterswere broadcasting something you would call second best,that competition was enough to break, at that time,this legal cartel over access to music.Okay. Three stories. Here's the argument.In my view, the most significant thing to recognizeabout what this Internet is doingis its opportunity to revive the read-write culturethat Sousa romanticized.Digital technology is the opportunityfor the revival of these vocal chordsthat he spoke so passionately to Congress about.User-generated content, spreading in businessesin extraordinarily valuable ways like these,celebrating amateur culture.By which I don't mean amateurish culture,I mean culture where people producefor the love of what they're doing and not for the money.I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time.For when you think of what Sousa romanticizedin the young people together, singing the songs of the day,of the old songs, you should recognizewhat your kids are doing right now.Taking the songs of the day and the old songsand remixing them to make them something different.It's how they understand access to this culture.So, let's have some very few examplesto get a sense of what I'm talking about here.Here's something called Anime Music Video, first example,taking anime captured from televisionre-edited to music tracks.(Music)This one you should be -- confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry.(Music)(Laughter)And this is the best.(Music)My love ...There's only you in my life ...The only thing that's bright ...My first love ...You're every breath that I take ...You're every step I make ...And I ....I want to share all my love with you ...No one else will do ...And your eyes ...They tell me how much you care ...(Music)So, this is remix, right?(Applause)And it's important to emphasize that what this is notis not what we call, quote, "piracy."I'm not talking about nor justifyingpeople taking other people's content in wholesaleand distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner.I'm talking about people taking and recreatingusing other people's content, using digital technologiesto say things differently.Now, the importance of thisis not the technique that you've seen here.Because, of course, every technique that you've seen hereis something that television and film producershave been able to do for the last 50 years.The importance is that that technique has been democratized.It is now anybody with access to a $1,500 computerwho can take sounds and images from the culture around usand use it to say things differently.These tools of creativity have become tools of speech.It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak.It is how our kids think. It is what your kids areas they increasingly understand digital technologiesand their relationship to themselves.Now, in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies,the law has not greeted this Sousa revivalwith very much common sense.Instead, the architecture of copyright lawand the architecture of digital technologies,as they interact, have produced the presumptionthat these activities are illegal.Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies,then in the digital world the one fact we can't escapeis that every single use of culture produces a copy.Every single use therefore requires permission;without permission, you are a trespasser.You're a trespasser with about as much senseas these people were trespassers.Common sense here, though, has not yet revoltedin response to this response that the law has offeredto these forms of creativity.Instead, what we've seenis something much worse than a revolt.There's a growing extremism that comes from both sidesin this debate, in response to this conflictbetween the law and the use of these technologies.One side builds new technologies, such as one recently announcedthat will enable themto automatically take down from sites like YouTubeany content that has any copyrighted content in it,whether or not there's a judgment of fair usethat might be applied to the use of that content.And on the other side, among our kids,there's a growing copyright abolitionism,a generation that rejects the very notionof what copyright is supposed to do, rejects copyrightand believes that the law is nothing more than an assto be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible.The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other,a fact we should have learned many, many times over,and both extremes in this debate are just wrong.Now, the balance that I try to fight for,I, as any good liberal, try to fight for firstby looking to the government. Total mistake, right?(Laughter)Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get themto do something to make the system make more sense.It failed partly because the courts are too passive,partly because the legislatures are corrupted,by which I don't mean that there's briberyoperating to stop real change,but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functionsmeans that policymakers here will not understand thisuntil it's too late to fix it.So, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution.And the solution here, in my view, is a private solution,a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again,and to realize the economic potential of that,and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant.Because, as BMI demonstrated, competition herecan achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now.We don't have a public domain to draw upon now,so instead what we need is two types of changes.First, that artists and creators embrace the idea,choose that their work be made available more freely.So, for example, they can say their work is available freelyfor non-commercial, this amateur-type of use,but not freely for any commercial use.And second, we need the businessesthat are building out this read-write cultureto embrace this opportunity expressly, to enable it,so that this ecology of free content, or freer content,can grow on a neutral platformwhere they both exist simultaneously,so that more-free can compete with less-free,and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competitioncan teach one the lessons of the other.Now, I would talk about one particular such planthat I know something about,but I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling,so I'm not going to talk about this at all.I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us.That artist choice is the key for new technologyhaving an opportunity to be open for business,and we need to build artist choice hereif these new technologies are to have that opportunity.But let me end with something I think much more important --much more important than business.It's the point about how this connects to our kids.We have to recognize they're different from us. This is us, right?(Laughter)We made mixed tapes; they remix music.We watched TV; they make TV.It is technology that has made them different,and as we see what this technology can do,we need to recognize you can't killthe instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it.We can't stop our kids from using it.We can only drive it underground.We can't make our kids passive again.We can only make them, quote, "pirates." And is that good?We live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions,where in many areas of our life,we live life constantly against the law.Ordinary people live life against the law,and that's what I -- we are doing to our kids.They live life knowing they live it against the law.That realization is extraordinarily corrosive,extraordinarily corrupting.And in a democracy, we ought to be able to do better.Do better, at least for them, if not for opening for business.Thank you very much.(Applause)

You know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains,far from these beautiful mountains, where the peopleof the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different,which is to measure their gross national happinessrather than their gross national product.And why not?After all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few,but a fundamental human right for all.And what is happiness?Happiness is the freedom of choice.The freedom to chose where to live,what to do, what to buy, what to sell,from whom, to whom, when and how.Where does choice come from?And who gets to express it, and how do we express it?Well, one way to express choice is through the market.Well-functioning markets provide choices, and ultimately,the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness.The great Indian economist, Amartya Sen, was awarded the Nobel prizefor demonstrating that famine is not so much aboutthe availability of food supply, but rather the ability to acquireor entitle oneself to that food through the market.In 1984, in what can only be considered one of thegreatest crimes of humanity, nearly one million people died of starvationin my country of birth, Ethiopia.Not because there was not enough food --because there was actually a surplus of foodin the fertile regions of the south parts of the country --but because in the north, people could not accessor entitle themselves to that food.That was a turning point for my life.Most Africans today, by far, are farmers.And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large,small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very smallfarmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.African agriculture today is among, or is, the most under-capitalized in the world.Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated,compared to 40 percent in Asia.African farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare,compared to 144 in Asia.Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa.There are eight times more tractors in Latin America,and three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa.The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice,and therefore without much freedom.His livelihood is predeterminedby the conditions of grinding poverty.He comes to the market when prices are lowest,with the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest,because he has no choice.She comes back to the marketsome months later, when prices are highest, in what we callthe lean season -- when food is scarce --because she has to feed her family and has no choice.The real question is, how can markets be developed in rural Africato harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurshipthat we know exists?Another notable economist, Theodore Schultz,in 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmersare efficient, but poor.Meaning, in fact, that farmers are rationaland profit-minded just like everybody else.Well, we don't need, now,any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shakeat the market and want to make money, just like everyone else.And one thing is clear, which is at least now we knowthat Africa is open for business.And that business is agriculture.Over two decades ago, the world insisted to Africa that marketsmust be liberalized, that economies must be structurally adjusted.This meant that governments were to remove themselvesfrom the business of buying and selling --which they did rather inefficiently --and let the private market do its magic.Well, what happened over the last 25 years?Did Africa feed itself?Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors?I think we're all in this room,probably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only regionin the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go upover the next 10 years,where the food import bill is now doublewhat it was 20 years ago,where food production per capita hasstagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased.So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations?The market reforms prompted by the West --and I've spent some 15 years traveling around the continentdoing research on agricultural markets, and have interviewedtraders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent, hundreds of traders --trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform.And it seems to me that the reforms might havethrown the baby out with the bath water.Like its agriculture,Africa's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient.We know from our work around the continentthat transaction costs of reaching the market,and the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets,are extremely high.In fact, only one third of agricultural outputproduced in Africa even reaches the market.Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructurein terms of roads and telecommunications, but also becauseof the virtual absence of necessary market institutions, such asmarket information, grades and standards,and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.Because of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles,in narrow networks of people they know and trust.And because of that, as grain changes hands --and I've measured that it changes hands four, five times inits trajectory from the farmer to the consumer --every time it changes hands -- and I've seen this all over rural Africa --it also changes sacks.And I thought that was incredibly peculiar.And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell meover and over -- that's the only way people know what they're gettingin terms of the quantity and the product quality.And that actually has huge implicationsfor the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals,and situations where there are deficits, for example.It also has very high cost implications.I have measured that 26 percent of the marketing marginis simply due to the fact that, because of the absenceof grades and standards and market information,sacks have to be constantly changed.And this leads to very high handling costs.For their part, small farmers, who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa,come to the market with virtually no information at all -- blind --trusting that they're going to havesome sort of demand for their produce,and completely at the mercy of the merchantsin the only market, the nearest local market they know --where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk.Speaking of risk, we have seen that price volatilityof food crops in Africa is the highest in the world.In Africa, small farmers bear the brunt of this risk.In fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in historythat farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market riskthat Africa's farmers have to bear.And in my view, there is simply no place in the worldthat has grown its agriculture on the kind of riskthat our farmers in Africa today face.In Ethiopia, for example, the variation in maize pricesfrom year to year is as much as 50 percent annually.This kind of market risk is mind-boggling, and has direct implicationsfor not only the incentives of farmers to investin higher productivity technology, such as modern seeds and fertilizers,but also direct implications for food security.To give you an example, between 2001 and 2002,Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest.That in turn, because of the weak marketing system,led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country.This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields.And we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grainwas left in the fields to rot in early 2002.Not six months later, in July 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis,to the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation.What also happened that yearis in the areas where there were good rains, and where farmershad previously produced surplus grain, farmers had decidedto withdraw from the fertilizer market, not use fertilizerand actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent.This is a tragic example of arrested development,or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks.And this is not just specific to Ethiopia,but happens over and over, all over Africa.Well, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands.I am here to tell you that change is in the air.Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions,or cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions.Africa has learned, or is learning somewhat slowly,that markets don't happen by themselves.In the 1980s, it was very fashionableto talk about getting prices right.There was a very influential book about that,which was mainly about getting governments out of the market.We now recognize that getting markets right is about not justprice incentives, but also investing in the right infrastructureand the appropriate and necessary institutions to createthe conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market.When conditions are right, we know and seethat that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa,just like anywhere else.Nearly three years ago, I decided to leave my comfortable jobas a World Bank senior economist in Washingtonand come back to my country of birth, Ethiopia,after nearly 30 years abroad.I did so for a simple reason.After having spent more than a decadeunderstanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donorsabout what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets,I decided it was time to do something about it.I currently lead, in Ethiopia, an exciting new initiativeto establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, or ECX.Now, the commodity exchange itself, that concept,is not new to the world.In fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got togetherin a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michiganto establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.That was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade,which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.The Chicago Board of Trade was established thenfor precisely the same reasonsthat our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto bargesand send it upriver to the Chicago market.But once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found,or if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.And in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan,rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.Well, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous lossesled to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying systemof grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receiptson the basis of which trade could be done.From there, the greatest innovation of all came about in this market,which is that buyers and sellers could transact grainwithout actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain.That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances,and even across time -- as far forward as 18 months into the future.This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture,and the rise of Chicago to a global market,agricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town.Now, over the last century,we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purviewof Western industrialized countries,and that the reference prices for cotton, coffee, cocoa --products produced mainly in the south --are actually a reference price, or a price discovered in theseorganized commodity exchanges in the northern countries.But that is actually changing.And we're seeing a shift --powered mainly because of information technology --a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets.And over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges --and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world --has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade.Similarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example,where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing hereover the last three years by 270 percent a year.This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology,aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.China's Dalian Commodity Exchange, three years ago,2004, overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to becomethe second largest commodity exchange in the world.Now, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designingthe first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago modelor the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailoredto Ethiopia's needs and realities,Ethiopia's small farmers.So, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.We're creating a system that serves all market actors,that creates integrity, trust, efficiency, transparencyand enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described.In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia,we've done something rather unique, which is totake the approach of an integrated perspective,or what we call the ECX Edge.The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystemin which the market will develop itself.And this is because one of the things we've learnedover the last decade of studying market development in Africais that the piecemeal approach does not work.You've got one donor trying to develop market information,another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards,another ICT, and yet another on warehousing, or warehouse receipts.In our approach in Ethiopia,we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem,or environment, in which trade takes place.That means that the exchange will operate a trading system,which will initially start as an open outcry,because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading.But at the same time, we'll do something which I think no exchangein the world has ever done, which is itself to operate something likean Internet cafe in the rural areas.So that farmers and small traderscan actually come to a terminal center -- what we callthe remote access terminal centers -- and actually,without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial upor any of those things, simply see the tradingthat's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor.At the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that --and again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange --is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country,in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done.And in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system,to assure that payment is done appropriately,in the right amount and at the right time,so that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.Obviously, we work with exchange actors,and as we're developing the exchange market itself,we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework,the overarching legal framework for making this market work.So, in fact, our proclamationis going to parliament next month.What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information systemto disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country,using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price disseminationdirectly to farmers.What this does is transforms, fundamentally,the farmers' relationship to the market.Whereas before the farmer used to think local --meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market,eight to 10 kilometers away on average,and sell whatever they happened to have,without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was --now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.And they start to think national, and even global.They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions,but also planting decisions, on the basis of informationcoming from the futures price market.And they come to the market knowing what grades their productswill achieve in terms of a price premium.So all of this will transform farmers.It will also transform the way traders do business.It will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrageto really thinking strategically about how to move grainacross long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].Can Ethiopia do this?It seems very ambitious.But it will create new opportunities.We believe that this initiative requires great political will,and we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector,and really even the underlying legal framework.We believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium,which starts in about eight months.The last parliament of our century opened with our presidentannouncing to the country that this was the most importanteconomic initiative for the country today.We believe that the stakes are high,but that the returns will be even greater.ECX, moreover, can become a trading platform for a pan-African marketin agricultural commodities.Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.And we feel that over the next five years,if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market,and add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles.Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higherthan South Africa's grain production,and, in fact, Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa.So the potential is there.The will is there.The commitment is there.So we feel that we have a winning value propositionto transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture,and to change Africa.So, we are in the business of finding our happiness.Thank you very much.(Applause)

Chris Anderson: Welcome to TED.Richard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great.CA: Have you met anyone interesting?RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn,because I had an apology to make to her.I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd --she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.And I went home to my wife that nightand she wanted to know why I had another woman's big,massive, big wedding ring on my finger.And, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jewelerand get it cut off.So -- (Laughter) --so apologies to Goldie.CA: That's pretty good.So, we're going to put up some slidesof some of your companies here.You've started one or two in your time.So, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records --I guess it all started with a magazine called Student.And then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this?RB: I read all these sort of TED instructions:you must not talk about your own business, and this,and now you ask me.So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage,since you asked the question.(Laughter)CA: It depends what the answer is though.RB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company,you can really run any companies.I mean, companies are all about finding the right people,inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people.And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitiveand I love taking on, you know, the status quoand trying to turn it upside down.So I've seen life as one long learning process.And if I see -- you know, if I fly on somebody else's airlineand find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't,21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can createthe kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.And so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go.CA: Well, that was a bizarre thing,because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who,at the time when you basically sold Virgin Recordsand invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic,and his view was that you were trading, you know,the world's fourth biggest record companyfor the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.Why did you do that?RB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure.And I think if you start a business without financial backing,you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways.They were trying to put our airline out of business,and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign.And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing downunless I chipped in a chip.And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline,and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company,I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline.CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually,for that as well.RB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.But, yeah, it was sad at the time, but we moved on.CA: Now, you use the Virgin brand a lotand it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other.What does the brand stand for in your head?RB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality,that you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they --CA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit?RB: No, but I was going to move on this.We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it.As I say, we go in and shake up other industries,and I think, you know, we do it differentlyand I think that industries are not quite the sameas a result of Virgin attacking the market.CA: I mean, there are a few launches you've donewhere the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.I mean, Virgin Brides -- what happened there?(Laughter)RB: We couldn't find any customers.(Laughter)(Applause)CA: I was actually also curious why --I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.I mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well?Ain't virgin no longer, or something.RB: Again, we may have had problems finding customers.I mean, we had -- often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints,you know, you can deal with them.But about three months after the launch of the condom company,I had a letter, a complaint,and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely.But obviously, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.And then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken,I got this delightful letter with a picture of the babyasking if I'd be godfather, which I became.So, it all worked out well.CA: Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful.RB: I should have.CA: So, just help us with some of the numbers.I mean, what are the numbers on this?I mean, how big is the group overall?How much -- what's the total revenue?RB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total.CA: And how many employees?RB: About 55,000.CA: So, you've been photographed in various ways at various timesand never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that.What was that? Was that real?RB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.No, I mean, I think --CA: But is that your hair?RB: No.CA: What was that one?RB: Dropping in for tea.CA: OK.(Laughter)RB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which --CA: Oh, that car that we -- actually we --it was a TEDster event there, I think.Is that -- could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute?(Laughter)RB: It's a tough job, isn't it?CA: I mean, it is a tough job.(Laughter)When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as welland they kind of -- they have these different rules over here,it's very strange.RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but --CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about --RB: "Pammy" we launched, you know --mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola,and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy"and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.But the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but --(Laughter)CA: Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps?RB: Of course.CA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice.And, OK, so stop there. This was -- you had some award I think?RB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols'"God Save The Queen," and I'd certainly never expectedthat 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us.But somehow, she must have had a forgetful memory, I think.CA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how?RB: Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard.Occasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richardand think there's some Shakespearean play taking place.But nowhere else anyway.CA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...RB: No. I suppose if you're having problemsgetting a booking in a restaurant or something,that might be worth using it.CA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson.RB: I'll go get the secretary to use it.CA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to,and Virgin Galactic up in the air. (Video)So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?RB: Yeah, it'll be ready in -- well, ready in 12 monthsand then we do 12 months extensive testing.And then 24 months from now,people will be able to take a ride into space.CA: So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed?RB: Philippe has done the -- yeah, quite a bit of it:the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico.And basically, he's just taken an eyeand the space station will be one giant eye,so when you're in space,you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you.And when you land, you'll be able to go back into this giant eye.But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design.CA: But you didn't have him design the engine?RB: Philippe is quite erratic,so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no.CA: He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago.RB: Yeah? No, he is a --CA: Well, some people found it wonderful,some people found it completely bizarre.But, I personally found it wonderful.RB: He's a wonderful enthusiast, which is why I love him. But ...CA: So, now, you've always had this exploration bug in you.Have you ever regretted that?RB: Many times.I mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past.Well, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so --and each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale.So in those moments,you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or --CA: What was the closest you got to --when did you think, this is it, I might be on my way out?RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was,each one, actually, I think we came close.And, I mean, first of all we --nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before,so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream,and we weren't quite sure,when a balloon actually got into the jet stream,whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.And so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic,as we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon --the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour,the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour,and it just took off.And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.And we were just crossing every finger,praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know --something seemed to go wrong every time,and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with mejumped, and left me holding on for dear life.(Laughter)CA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, "I'm out of here!" and ...RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone,the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ...CA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that.RB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon,with my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below,trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which --and it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.But, anyway, we managed to survive it.CA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end?RB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left,and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped,I would only have a couple of minutes of life left.So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately triedto make sure that I was making the right decision.And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again,looked down at those clouds again,climbed back into the capsule again.And then finally, just thought, there's a better way.I've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me,it's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it?And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds,and about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over.And the balloon hit the seaand went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and --CA: What did you write to your family?RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that:just I love you very much. AndI'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which --just in case anything had happened.But fortunately, they never had to use it.CA: Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics.The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls,you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guydoing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing.How much was the PR value part of this?RB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner,the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats,and crashing into the seas.(Laughter)CA: They have a point, Richard.RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying,you know, come on, Richard,there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic.(Laughter)CA: To do all this,you must have been a genius from the get-go, right?RB: Well, I won't contradict that.(Laughter)CA: OK, this isn't exactly hardball. OK.Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school?RB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever.I certainly would have failed IQ tests.And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.And if I -- if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it.As somebody who's dyslexic,you also have some quite bizarre situations.I mean, for instance, I've had to -- you know,I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe,but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross.And so the board meetings have been fascinating.(Laughter)And so, it's like, good news or bad news?And generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news.CA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross?(Laughter)RB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having --(Laughter) --I've got it right.CA: No, trust me, it's gross.(Laughter)RB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said,"Look Richard, here's a -- let me draw on a diagram.Here's a net in the sea,and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net.And that's the profits you've got left over in this little net,everything else is eaten."And I finally worked it all out.(Laughter)(Applause)CA: But, I mean, at school -- so as well as being,you know, doing pretty miserably academically,but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams.So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader,but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ...RB: Yeah, I think I was a bit of a maverick and -- but I ... And I was,yeah, I was fortunately good at sport,and so at least I had something to excel at, at school.CA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life.I mean, there's the story about your motherallegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying "OK, walk home."Did this really happen?RB: She was, you know,she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.So she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for,such as pushing us out of the car,and telling us to find our own way to Granny's,about five miles before we actually got there.And making us go on wonderful, long bike rides.And we were never allowed to watch television and the like.CA: But is there a risk here?I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids,and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and thinkthey're too coddled, they don't know what they've got,we're going to raise a generation of privileged ...RB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids,you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm.So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.CA: You didn't turn out too bad, I have to say, I'm ...Your headmaster said to you --I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school --he said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison,and I'm not sure which.Which of those happened first?(Laughter)RB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first.I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.I was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Actand the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act.On the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which --we had a center where we would help young people who had problems.And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.And there's an ancient law that saysyou can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.So the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest usif we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.We changed it to social diseasesand people came along with acne and spots,but nobody came with VD any more.So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.And then subsequently, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,"the word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrestedfor using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album.And John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.And he asked if I could find a linguistics expertto come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.And so I rang up Nottingham University,and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.And he said, "Look, bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.It's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century."(Laughter)And he went, "Furthermore, I'm a priest myself."And so I said, "Would you mind coming to the court?"And he said he'd be delighted. And I said --and he said, "Would you like me to wear my dog collar?"And I said, "Yes, definitely. Please."(Laughter)CA: That's great.RB: So our key witness argued that it was actually"Never Mind the Priest, Here's the Sex Pistols."(Laughter)And the judge found us -- reluctantly found us not guilty, so ...(Laughter)CA: That is outrageous.(Applause)So seriously, is there a dark side?A lot of people would say there's no waythat someone could put together this incredible collection of businesseswithout knifing a few people in the back,you know, doing some ugly things.You've been accused of being ruthless.There was a nasty biography written about you by someone.Is any of it true? Is there an element of truth in it?RB: I don't actually think that the stereotypeof a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top,generally speaking, works.I think if you treat people well,people will come back and come back for more.And I think all you have in life is your reputationand it's a very small world.And I actually think that the best wayof becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well,and I like to think that's how we run Virgin.CA: And what about the people who love you and who see you spending --you keep getting caught up in these new projects,but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff.You get excited by an idea and, kapow!I mean, do you think about life balance?How do your family feel abouteach time you step into something big and new?RB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important,so from the time the kids were very young,you know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them.And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.Yes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky,we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can --so I can take them there and we can bring friends,and we can play together,but I can also keep in touch with what's going on.CA: You started talking in recent yearsabout this term capitalist philanthropy.What is that?RB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works.You know, the alternative, communism, has not worked.But the problem with capitalism isextreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people,and therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.And I think it's important that the individuals,who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competingfor bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars,but, you know, use that money to either create new jobsor to tackle issues around the world.CA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about,want to turn your resources toward?RB: Well, there's -- I mean there's a lot of issues.I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankindand we are putting a lot of time and energy into,A, trying to come up with alternative fuelsand, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prizein case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels,in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissionscut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point.We need to try to encourage people to come up with a wayof extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere.And we just -- you know, there weren't really peopleworking on that before, so we wanted people to try to --all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that,and also to try to extract the methaneout of the Earth's atmosphere as well.And actually, we've had about 15,000 people fill in the formssaying they want to give it a go.And so we only need one, so we're hopeful.CA: And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects?RB: Yes, I mean, we've got -- we're setting up something calledthe war room, which is maybe the wrong word.We're trying to -- maybe we'll change it -- but anyway, it's a war roomto try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa,all the different social problems in Africa,and try to look at best practices.So, for instance,there's a doctor in Africa that's found thatif you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant,that the baby will not have HIV when it's born.And so disseminating that information toaround the rest of Africa is important.CA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the Westget so excited about -- I mean, they're used to having an idea,getting stuff done, and they believe profoundlyin their ability to make a difference in the world.Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say,we've got to fix this problem and we can do it,I've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da --here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situationand actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that?RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually --we're working with the government on it.I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with acceptingHIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think,of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him,it's a way of working with him, with his government.It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help,they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years.It's got to be consistent.But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-howand help governments approach things slightly differently.For instance, we're setting up clinics in Africawhere we're going to be givingfree antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatmentand free malaria treatment.But we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics,so that people pay for some other aspects.CA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates,or whatever, that this is really being -- it's almost driven bysome sort of desire again, you know, for the right image,for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct.What would you say to them?RB: Well, I think that everybody --people do things for a whole variety of different reasonsand I think that, you know, when I'm on me deathbed,I will want to feel that I've made a differenceto other people's lives.And that may be a selfish thing to think,but it's the way I've been brought up.I think if I'm in a position toradically change other people's lives for the better,I should do so.CA: How old are you?RB: I'm 56.CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand himand I'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s, 40s people are driven bythis desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdomand a search for legacy.I mean, it seems like you're stilla little bit in the growth phases,you're still doing these incredible new plans.How much do you think about legacy,and what would you like your legacy to be?RB: I don't think I think too much about legacy.I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101,so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go.No, I just want to live life to its full.You know, if I can make a difference,I hope to be able to make a difference.And I think one of the positive things at the moment isyou've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance,who are good friends.And, thank God, you've got two peoplewho genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.If they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world,it would be very worrying.And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world.And I think it's importantthat people in that kind of position do make a difference.CA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business,I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of --I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthlessand that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought,well, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way.So I would like to thank you for that inspiration,and for coming to TED today. Thank you.Thank you so much.(Applause)

I am known best for human-powered flight,but that was just one thing that got me goingin the sort of things that I'm working in now.As a youngster, I was very interested in model airplanes,ornithopters, autogyros, helicopters, gliders, power planes,indoor models, outdoor models, everything,which I just thought was a lot of fun,and wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them.And then, navy pilot training, and, after college,I got into sailplane flying, power plane flying,and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun,but got tangled up with some great professor types,who convinced me and everybody else in the fieldthat this was a good way to get into really deep science.While this was all going on, I was in the field of weather modification,although getting a Ph.D. in aeronautics.The weather modification subject was getting started,and as a graduate student,I could go around to the various talks that were being given,on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast,and so on. And everybody would talk to me,but all the professionals in the field hated each other,and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result,I got the absolutely unique background in that field,and started a company, which did more researchin weather modification than anybody,and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into.But then, 1971 started AeroVironment, with no employees --then one or two, three,and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects.We had AirDynamisis,who, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companieson some big, many year project,and so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew.The thing that is exciting was, in 1976,I suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplanebecause I'd made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars,or I guaranteed the money at the bank.He needed them -- he needed the money for starting a company.The company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back,and I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt,and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight,which had then been around for -- (Laughter) --17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds,which, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars.So suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight --(Laughter) --and did not -- the way I approached it, first,thinking about ways to make the planes,was just like they'd been doing in England, and not succeeding,and I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way.But then, got off on a vacation trip, and was studying bird flight,just for the fun of it,and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles,and measure the time, and estimate the bank angle,and immediately, figure out its speed,and the turning radius, and so on,which I could do in the car, as we're driving along on a vacation trip --(Laughter) --with my three sons, young sons, helping me,but ridiculing the whole thing very much.But that began thinking about how birds went around,and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly,and then other planes,and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged,was so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place,but one didn't. And it was just, keep the weight down --70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up, like a hang glider,but three times the span, three times the cord.You're down to a third of the speed, a third of the power,and a good bicyclist can put out that power, and that worked,and we won the prize a year later.We didn't -- a lot of flying, a lot of experiments, a lot of things that didn't work,and ones that did work, and the plane kept getting a little better, a little better.Got a good pilot, Brian Allen, to operate it,and finally, succeeded. But unfortunately,about 65,000 dollars was spent on the project.(Laughter)And there was only about 30 to help retire the debt.But fortunately, Henry Kramer, who put up the prize for --that was a one-mile flight -- put up a new prizefor flying the English Channel, 21 miles.And he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that.We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit,the power to fly would be decreased a little bit,and if you decrease the power required a little,the pilot can fly a much longer period of time.And Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight,to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel,and we won the 100,000-pound, 200,000-dollar prize for that.And when all expenses were paid, the debt was handled, and everything was fine.It turned out that giving the planes to the museumwas worth much more than the debt,so for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.So, there were good economic reasons for the project, but --(Laughter) --that's not, well, the project was done entirely for economic reasons,and we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then --(Laughter) --because the prizes are all over.(Laughter)But that sure started me thinking about various things,and immediately, we began making a solar-powered planebecause we felt solar power was going to be so importantfor the country and the world,we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased,which is what the government was trying to do with it.And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense,but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar powerand maybe help that field.And that project continued, did succeed,and we then got into other projects in aviationand mechanical things and ground devices.But while this was going on,in 1982, I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation --their annual prize --and I had to prepare a paper on it,which collected all my varied thoughtsand varied interests over the years.This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I, really, was after,and what was important. And to my surprise,I realized the importance of environmental issues,which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to,and preparing that paper did me a lot of good.I thought back about if I was a space traveler,and came and visited Earth every 5,000 years.And for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time,the little differences in the Earth.But this last time, just coming round, right now,suddenly, there'd be huge changes in the environment,in the concentration of people,and it was just unbelievable, the amount of -- all the change in it.I wanted to -- well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago,we began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution,and 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground,with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production,will reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down,and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation.I wanted to show the slide --this slide, I think, is the most important one any of you will see, ever, because --(Laughter)(Applause) --it shows nature versus humans, and goes from 1850 to 2050.And so, the year 2000, you see there.And this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates.Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on, are --the red line goes up. That's the humans and livestock and pets portion.The green line goes down. That's the wild nature portion.Humans, livestock and pets are, now, 98 percent of the total world's massof vertebrates on land and air.And you don't know what the future will hold,but it's not going to get a lower percentage.Ten thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and petswere not even one tenth of one percentand wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve.Now they are 98 percent, and it, I think, shows human domination of the Earth.I give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer,and ask them, after they've asked me questions,and I give them a talk and so on. Then I ask them questions.What's the population of the Earth?What's the population of the Earth going to bewhen you're the age of your parents?Which I'd never, really -- they had never, really, thought aboutbut, now, they think about it.And then, what population of the Earth would be an equilibriumthat could continue on, and be for 2050, 2100, 2150?And they form little groups, all fighting with each other,and when I leave, two hours later,most of them are saying about 2 billion people,and they don't have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion,nor do I, but I think they're right and this is a serious problem.Rachel Carson was thinking of these, and came out with "Silent Spring," way back."Solar Manifesto" by Hermann Scheer, in Germany,claims all energy on Earth can be derived, for every country,from solar energy and water, and so on.You don't need to dig down for these chemicals,and we can do things much more efficiently.Let's have the next slide.So this just summarizes it. "Over billions of years,on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life --complex and probable, wonderful and fragile.Suddenly, we humans, a recently arrived species,no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature,have grown in population, technology and intelligenceto a position of terrible power. We, now, wield the paintbrush."We're in charge. It's frightening.And I do a painting every 20 or 25 years. This is the last one.(Laughter)And [it] shows the Earth in a time flag: on the right,in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on;and over the triangle, we now get to civilization and TVand traffic jams and so on.I have no idea of what comes next,so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future,as a little warning.And two weeks after this drawing was done,we actually had our first project contract, at AeroVironment,on robotic cockroaches, which was very frightening to me.(Laughter)(Paper rustling)Well, that'll be all the slides.As time went on, we stopped our environmental programs.We focused more on the really serious energy problemsof the future, and we produced products for the company.And we developed the impact car that General Motors made,the EV1, out of --and got the Air Resources Board to have the regulationsthat stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart.And we've done a lot of things, small drone airplanes and so on.I have a Helios. We have the first video.(Video) Narrator: With a wingspan of 247 feet, this makes her larger than a Boeing 747.(Music)Her designers' attention to detail and her constructiongives Helios' structure the flexibility and strengthto deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere.This enables her to easily ride through the air currentsas if she's sliding along on the ocean waves.Paul MacCready: The wings could touch together on top and not break. We think.(Laughter)Narrator: And Helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun,to maximize the power from her solar array.(Music)As the sky gets darker, and the outside air temperatures dropbelow minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit,the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journeyhas gone by without notice,except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systemsand their associated sensors.Approaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet,at 4:12 p.m., Helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.This is more than 10,000 feet higherthan the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird.(Applause)PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications,and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.Eventually, it will be able to have to stay up day, night, day, night,for six months at a time, acting like the synchronous satellite,but only ten miles above the Earth.Let's have the next video. This shows the other end of the spectrum.(Video) Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance.In effect a pair of roving eyeglasses,a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can leadif the operator is remote from the vehicle.It is convenient to carry, assemble, and launch by hand.Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.With on-board GPS, it can navigate autonomously,and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.PM: Okay, and let's have the next.(Applause)That plane is widely used by the military, now, in all their operations.Let's have the next video.(Video) (Music)Alan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head.(Music)We're going to end our visit with Paul MacCready's flying circusby meeting his son, Tyler, who, with his two brothers,helped build the Gossamer Condor, 25 years ago.Tyler MacCready: You can chase it, like this, for hours.AA: When they got bored with their father's project,they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own.TM: And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing, or on the other.AA: They called it their Walkalong Glider.(Music)I've never seen anything like that.How old were you when you invented that?TM: Oh, 10, 11. (AA: Oh my God.)TM: 12, something like that. (AA: That's amazing.)PM: And Tyler's here to show you the Walkalong.(Applause)TM: All right. You all got a couple of these in your gift bags,and one of the first things,the production version seemed to dive a little bit,and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bitbefore you try flying it.I'll give you a demonstration of how it works.The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff.As the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff, soas you walk through the air, it goes around your body, some has to go over you.And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.The launch is the difficult part: you've got to hold it high up, over your head,and you start walking forward, and just let go of it, and you can control it like that.(Laughter)And then also, like it said in the video,you can turn it left or rightjust by putting the lift under one wing or another.So I can do it -- oops, that was going to be a right turn.(Laughter)Okay, this one will be a left turn.Here, but --(Applause) --anyway.(Applause)And that's it, so you can just control it, wherever you want,and it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production,so you have real collector's items.(Laughter)And this, we just wanted to show you --if we can get the video running on this, yeah --just an example of a little video surveillance.(Laughter)This was flying around in the party last night, and --(Laughter) --you can see how it just can fly around,and you can spy on anybody you want.(Laughter)And that's it. I was going to bring an airplane,but I was worried about hitting people in here,so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle.And that's it, yeah, just a few inventions.(Applause)All right.



steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence
1885656

Images like this, from the Auschwitz concentration camp,have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth centuryand have given us a new understanding of who we are,where we've come from and the times we live in.During the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocitiesof Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides,and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old,we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfurand the daily horrors of Iraq.This has led to a common understanding of our situation,namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence, and perhapsthat native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from, to our peril.Here is an examplefrom an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globea couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, "The Indian lifewas a difficult one, but there were no employment problems,community harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown,crime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribeswas largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminateor wholesale slaughter." Now, you're all familiar with this treacle.We teach it to our children. We hear it on televisionand in storybooks. Now, the original title of this sessionwas, "Everything You Know Is Wrong," and I'm going to present evidencethat this particular part of our common understanding is wrong,that, in fact, our ancestors were far more violent than we are,that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time,and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence.Now, in the decade of Darfur and Iraq,a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatoryand obscene. But I'm going to try to convince youthat that is the correct picture. The decline of violenceis a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia,over centuries, over decades and over years,although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onsetof the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees itall over the world, although not homogeneously.It's especially evident in the West, beginning with Englandand Holland around the time of the Enlightenment.Let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 --from the millennium scale to the year scale --to try to persuade you of this. Until 10,000 years ago, all humanslived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlementsor government. And this is the state that's commonly thoughtto be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologistLawrence Keeley, looking at casualty ratesamong contemporary hunter-gatherers, which is our best sourceof evidence about this way of life, has shown a rather different conclusion.Here is a graph that he put togethershowing the percentage of male deaths due to warfarein a number of foraging, or hunting and gathering societies.The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will dieat the hands of another man, as opposed to passing awayof natural causes, in a variety of foraging societiesin the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest.And they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will dieat the hands of another man to, in the case of the Gebusi,only a 15 percent chance. The tiny, little blue bar in the lowerleft-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United Statesand Europe in the twentieth century, and includes all the deathsof both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailedduring the 20th century, there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million.Also at the millennium scale, we can lookat the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones describedin the Bible. And in this supposed source of our moral values,one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare,such as the following from Numbers 31: "And they warredagainst the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses,and they slew all the males. And Moses said unto them,'Have you saved all the women alive? Now, therefore, kill every maleamong the little ones and kill every woman that hath known manby lying with him, but all the women children that have not know a manby lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'" In other words,kill the men; kill the children; if you see any virgins,then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them.You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk.Also in the Bible, one sees that the death penaltywas the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality,adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, talking back to your parents --(Laughter) -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath.Well, let's click the zoom lensdown one order of magnitude, and look at the century scale.Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughoutthe Middle Ages to modern times,we know just from conventional history -- the evidencewas under our nose all along that there has been a reductionin socially sanctioned forms of violence.For example, any social history will reveal that mutilation and torturewere routine forms of criminal punishment. The kind of infractiontoday that would give you a fine, in those days would result inyour tongue being cut out, your ears being cut off, you being blinded,a hand being chopped off and so on.There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment:burning at the stake, disemboweling, breaking on the wheel,being pulled apart by horses and so on.The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes:criticizing the king, stealing a loaf of bread. Slavery, of course,was the preferred labor-saving device, and cruelty wasa popular form of entertainment. Perhaps the most vivid examplewas the practice of cat burning, in which a cat was hoistedon a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire,and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat, howling in pain,was burned to death.What about one-on-one murder? Well, there, there are good statistics,because many municipalities recorded the cause of death.The criminologist Manuel Eisnerscoured all of the historical records across Europefor homicide rates in any village, hamlet, town, countythat he could find, and he supplemented themwith national data, when nations started keeping statistics.He plotted on a logarithmic scale, going from 100 deathsper 100,000 people per year, which was approximately the rateof homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets downto less than one homicide per 100,000 people per yearin seven or eight European countries. Then, there is a slight uptickin the 1960s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would leadto the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that.But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitudein homicide from the Middle Ages to the present,and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century.Let's click down now to the decade scale.According to non-governmental organizationsthat keep such statistics, since 1945, in Europe and the Americas,there has been a steep decline in interstate wars,in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms, and in military coups,even in South America. Worldwide, there's been a steep declinein deaths in interstate wars. The yellow bars here show the numberof deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present.And, as you can see, the death rate goes down from 65,000 deathsper conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deathsper conflict per year in this decade, as horrific as it is.Even in the year scale, one can see a decline of violence.Since the end of the Cold War, there have been fewer civil wars,fewer genocides -- indeed, a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs --and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime.This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. You can seethat there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s,then it soared upward for several decades, and begana precipitous decline, starting in the 1990s, so that it went backto the level that was last enjoyed in 1960.President Clinton, if you're here, thank you.(Laughter)So the question is, why are so many people so wrongabout something so important? I think there are a number of reasons.One of them is we have better reporting. The Associated Pressis a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earththan sixteenth-century monks were.There's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it isto recall specific instances of something,the higher the probability that you assign to it.Things that we read about in the paper with gory footageburn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dyingin their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinionand advocacy markets: no one ever attracted observers, advocatesand donors by sayingthings just seem to be getting better and better.(Laughter)There's guilt about our treatment of native peoplesin modern intellectual life, and an unwillingness to acknowledgethere could be anything good about Western culture.And of course, our change in standards can outpace the changein behavior. One of the reasons violence went downis that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time.That's a process that seems to be continuing,but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day,things always look more barbaric than they would have beenby historic standards. So today, we get exercised -- and rightly so --if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injectionin Texas after a 15-year appeal process. We don't considerthat a couple of hundred years ago, they may have been burnedat the stake for criticizing the king after a trialthat lasted 10 minutes, and indeed, that that would have been repeatedover and over again. Today, we look at capital punishmentas evidence of how low our behavior can sink,rather than how high our standards have risen.Well, why has violence declined? No one really knows,but I have read four explanations, all of which, I think,have some grain of plausibility. The first is, maybeThomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who saidthat life in a state of nature was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutishand short." Not because, he argued,humans have some primordial thirst for bloodor aggressive instinct or territorial imperative,but because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy,there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively,before they invade you. More recently, Thomas Schellinggives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustlingin the basement. Being a good American, he has a pistolin the nightstand, pulls out his gun, and walks down the stairs.And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand.Now, each one of them is thinking,"I don't really want to kill that guy, but he's about to kill me.Maybe I had better shoot him, before he shoots me,especially since, even if he doesn't want to kill me,he's probably worrying right now that I might kill himbefore he kills me." And so on.Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought,and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first.Now, one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence.You don't strike first, but you have a publicly announced policythat you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded.The only thing is that it'sliable to having its bluff called, and therefore can only workif it's credible. To make it credible, you must avenge all insultsand settle all scores, which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta.Life becomes an episode of "The Sopranos." Hobbes' solution,the "Leviathan," was that if authority for the legitimate useof violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan --then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack,because any kind of aggression will be punished,leaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptationto invade preemptively, out of fear of them attacking you first.It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliationto make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore, it would leadto a state of peace. Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide ratesthat you failed to see in the earlier slide --argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europecoincided with the rise of centralized states.So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory.Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violencein zones of anarchy, in failed states, collapsed empires,frontier regions, mafias, street gangs and so on.The second explanation is that in many times and places,there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap.In earlier times, when suffering and early death were commonin one's own life, one has fewer compunctions about inflicting themon others. And as technology and economic efficiency make lifelonger and more pleasant, one puts a higher value on life in general.This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne.A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game,and was worked out in the book "Nonzero" by the journalistRobert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances,cooperation or non-violence can benefit both partiesin an interaction, such as gains in trade when two parties tradetheir surpluses and both come out ahead, or when two partieslay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividendthat results in them not having to fight the whole time.Wright argues that technology has increased the numberof positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in,by allowing the trade of goods, services and ideasover longer distances and among larger groups of people.The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead,and violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it,"Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bombthe Japanese is that they built my mini-van."(Laughter)The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a bookcalled "The Expanding Circle," by the philosopher Peter Singer,who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a senseof empathy, an ability to treat other peoples' interestsas comparable to one's own. Unfortunately, by defaultwe apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family.People outside that circle are treated as sub-human,and can be exploited with impunity. But, over history,the circle has expanded. One can see, in historical record,it expanding from the village, to the clan, to the tribe,to the nation, to other races, to both sexes,and, in Singer's own arguments, something that we should extendto other sentient species. The question is,if this has happened, what has powered that expansion?And there are a number of possibilities, such as increasing circlesof reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for.The logic of the golden rule -- the more you think about and interactwith other people, the more you realize that it is untenableto privilege your interests over theirs,at least not if you want them to listen to you. You can't saythat my interests are special compared to yours,anymore than you can say that the particular spotthat I'm standing on is a unique part of the universebecause I happen to be standing on it that very minute.It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism, by histories,and journalism, and memoirs, and realistic fiction, and travel,and literacy, which allows you to project yourself into the livesof other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human,and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own stationin life, the sense that "there but for fortune go I."Whatever its causes, the decline of violence, I think,has profound implications. It should force us to ask not just, whyis there war? But also, why is there peace? Not just,what are we doing wrong? But also, what have we been doing right?Because we have been doing something right,and it sure would be good to find out what it is.Thank you very much.(Applause).Chris Anderson: I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would saythat that expansion of -- that you were talking about,that Peter Singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology,by greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the worldis therefore getting smaller. I mean, is that also a grain of truth?Steven Pinker: Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory,that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperationover larger and larger circles. But also, I think it helps usimagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you readthese horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages, you think,how could they possibly have done it,how could they have not have empathized with the personthat they're disemboweling? But clearly,as far as they're concerned, this is just an alien beingthat does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything, I think,that makes it easier to imagine trading placeswith someone else means that it increases your moral considerationto that other person.CA: Well, Steve, I would love every news media owner to hear that talkat some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much.SP: My pleasure.

I am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most --the lights are really disturbing my eyesand they're reflecting on my glasses.I am very happy and honored to be amidstvery, very innovative and intelligent people.I have listened to the three previous speakers,and guess what happened?Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.(Laughter)But there is a saying in my culturethat if a bud leaves a tree without saying something,that bud is a young one.So, I will -- since I am not young and am very old,I still will say something.We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment,because another conference is taking place in Berlin.It is the G8 Summit.The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problemsshould be a massive increase in aid,something akin to the Marshall Plan.Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.Its largest recipients were Germany and France,and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.An average African country receives foreign aidto the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resourcesfrom rich countries to poor countries.But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.By displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,the media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.However, the media is not telling us the whole truth.Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine,although they're part and parcel of our African reality,they are not the only reality.And secondly, they are the smallest reality.Africa has 53 nations.We have civil wars only in six countries,which means that the media are covering only six countries.Africa has immense opportunities that never navigatethrough the web of despair and helplessnessthat the Western media largely presents to its audience.But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.And, as a consequence, the Western viewof Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.The wrong framing is a product of thinkingthat Africa is a place of despair.What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry.We should deliver medicines to those who are ill.We should send peacekeeping troopsto serve those who are facing a civil war.And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.I want to say that it is important to recognizethat Africa has fundamental weaknesses.But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa,from a challenge of despair,which is called poverty reduction,to a challenge of hope.We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africais not the challenge of reducing poverty.It should be a challenge of creating wealth.Once we change those two things --if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction,you have the international cartel of good intentionsmoving onto the continent, with what?Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry,and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war.And in the process, none of these things really are productivebecause you are treating the symptoms, not the causesof Africa's fundamental problems.Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines,ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from you findinga profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job.Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa,our second challenge will be,who are the wealth-creating agents in any society?They are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are alwaysabout four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators.But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.So, where should we be putting the money?We need to put money where it can productively grow.Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.Support research institutions,because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today?They are throwing large sums of money for primary health,for primary education, for food relief.The entire continent has been turned intoa place of despair, in need of charity.Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell mea neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know,who became rich by receiving charity?By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?Does any one of you in the audience have that person?Does any one of you know a country that developed because ofthe generosity and kindness of another?Well, since I'm not seeing the hand,it appears that what I'm stating is true.(Bono: Yes!)Andrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country.Which country is that?(Bono: It's an Irish land.)(Laughter)(Bono: [unclear])AM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this.External actors can only present to you an opportunity.The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantagedepends on your internal capacity.Africa has received many opportunities.Many of them we haven't benefited much.Why? Because we lack the internal, institutional frameworkand policy framework that can make it possible for usto benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example.Under the Cotonou Agreement,formerly known as the Lome Convention,African countries have been given an opportunity by Europeto export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tonsof sugar to the European Union market.We haven't exported one kilogram yet.We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,African countries that produce beefhave quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.None of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana,has ever met its quota.So, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa'sinability to engage the rest of the worldin a more productive relationshipis because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.And all forms of intervention need support,the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,the kinds of institutions that increase productivity.How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?Because all governments across the world need money to survive.Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,they need really to have the army clobber the opposition.The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.Why should people support their government?Well, because it gives them good, paying jobs,or, in many African countries, unofficial opportunitiesto profit from corruption.The fact is no government in the world,with the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.If the government's fiscal survivaldepends on it having to raise money from its own people,such a government is driven by self-interestto govern in a more enlightened fashion.It will sit with those who create wealth.Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutionsthat are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of businessso that it can collect more tax revenues from them.The problem with the African continentand the problem with the aid industryis that it has distorted the structure of incentivesfacing the governments in Africa.The productive margin in our governments' search for revenuedoes not lie in the domestic economy,it lies with international donors.Rather than sit with Ugandan --(Applause) --rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs,Ghanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders,our governments find it more productiveto talk to the IMF and the World Bank.I can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds.,you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry.Why? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understandthe incentives necessary to expand a business --it requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity,by the international community, to avoid buildingproductive arrangements with your own citizens,and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMFand the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bankthat tell them what its citizens need.In the process, we, the African people, have been sidelinedfrom the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy-implementation process in our countries.We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the worldhas taken over our rights as citizens,and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid,is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.But I want to put a caveat on my argument,and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.It may have built a road, and that roadmay have served a very good role.The mistake of the international aid industryis to pick these isolated incidents of success,generalize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them,and then spread them across the whole world,ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,the skills, the practices, the norms and habitsthat allowed that small aid project to succeed --like in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working --and therefore generalize this experienceas the experience of everybody.Aid increases the resources available to governments,and that makes working in a government the most profitable thingyou can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.By increasing the political attractiveness of the state,especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensionsas every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the statein order to get access to the foreign aid pie.Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africacannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sectorbecause the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.Governments are not changing it. Why?Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens.They talk to international donors.So, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,and that has increased the political tensions in our countriesprecisely because we depend on aid.I also want to say that it is important for us tonote that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aidfrom the international community,in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,and all other forms of aid.Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.Where has all the aid gone?I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda,and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean?Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percentof its own revenue?It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.But this shows you that the government of Ugandais not committed to spending its own revenueto invest in productive investments,but rather it devotes this revenueto paying structure of public expenditure.Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.The military, 380 billion.Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,takes only 18 billion.Trade and industry takes 43 billion.And let me show you, what does public expenditure --rather, public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute?There you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,by the way, who never see the president, except on television.(Laughter)(Applause)And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this,and even there, it is him who advises them.(Laughter)We have 81 units of local government.Each local government is organized like the central government --a bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament,and so many jobs for the political hangers-on.There were 56, and when our president wanted toamend the constitution and remove term limits,he had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81.Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament.You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.One hundred thirty-four commissionsand semi-autonomous government bodies,all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing,this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.A recent government of Uganda study foundthat there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehiclesat the Minister of Health headquarters.Uganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary,none of which has an ambulance.So, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquartersdrive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucratsand the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects,while the poor die without ambulances and medicine.Finally, I want to say that before I came to speak here,I was told that the principle of TEDGlobalis that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.It should be short enough to arouse interest,but long enough to cover the subject.I hope I have achieved that.(Laughter)Thank you very much.(Applause)

I've actually been waiting by the phonefor a call from TED for years.And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.In 2003, I was ready to do a talkabout the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.In 2004, I started Participant Productionsand we had a really good first year, and no call.And finally, I get a call last year,and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.(Laughter)You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.(Laughter)When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,I had some misgivings.But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.(Laughter)And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valleyhave a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.(Laughter)Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.Hollywood gathers around power tables,and the Valley gathers around power tables.So it turned out there was a lot more in commonthan I would have dreamed.But I'm actually here today to tell a story.And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,and they want to know what drives you a bit.And what really drives me is a vision of the futurethat I think we all share.It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.And when we heard a lot of the presentationsover the last couple of days,Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,I think we all realized how far we have to goto get to this new version of humanitythat I like to call "Humanity 2.0."And it's also something that resides in each of us,to close what I thinkare the two big calamities in the world today.One is the gap in opportunity --this gap that President Clinton last nightcalled uneven, unfair and unsustainable --and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and diseaseand all these evils that we see around us.But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad ideathat an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.And I think that's just a horrible thing.And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,because within each of us is the power toequal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.And if the men and women of TEDcan't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.And for me, a lot of this started when I was youngerand my family used to go camping in upstate New York.And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,except get beaten up by my sister or read books.And so I used to read authors like James Michenerand James Clavell and Ayn Rand.And their stories made the world seem a very smalland interconnected place.And it struck me that if I could write storiesthat were about this world as being small and interconnected,that maybe I could get people interested in the issuesthat affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.And my dad came home one dayand announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.But for a young man that made a real impression on me,that one never knows how much time one really has.So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.I started a couple of businessesthat I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.One of those businesses was a computer rental businesscalled Micros on the Move,which is very well named,because people kept stealing the computers.(Laughter)So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.And while I was there, I made friends with a fellownamed Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologizefor this. This is a photo from the old days.And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to mewith this idea to help peoplebuy and sell things online with each other.And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,I said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea."(Laughter)And needless to say, I was right.(Laughter)But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobsto build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.The company went public two years laterand is today one of the best known companies in the world.Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.But for me, personally, it was a real change.I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Altoand living off their leftovers,to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.And I wanted to figure out how I couldtake the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.And around that time, I met John Gardner,who is a remarkable man.He was the architect of the Great Society programsunder Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,or anyone could do, to make a differencein the long-term issues facing humanity.And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.Bet on good people doing good things."And that really resonated with me.I started a foundationto bet on these good people doing good things.These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,who are using business skills in a very leveraged wayto solve social problems.People today we call social entrepreneurs.And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,who started the Grameen Bank,has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,won the Nobel Peace Prize.But there's also a lot of people that you don't know.Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,because she felt girls' education was lagging.And she started it about 10 years ago,and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,also known as black fever.And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,which is really a scourge in the developing world.And so this is one way to beton good people doing good things.And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of changethat I find really is powerful.It's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate."And invest: if you see good people doing good things,invest in them. Invest in their organizations,or in business. Invest in these folks.Connecting them together through conferences --like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurshipthat my foundation does at Oxford every year.And celebrate them: tell their stories,because not only are there good people doing good work,but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,that really got me back to thinking when I was a kidand wanted to tell stories to get people involvedin the issues that affect us all.And a light bulb went off,which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?And I thought about the films that inspired me,films like "Gandhi" and "Schindler's List."And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.And there really wasn't a specific companythat was focused on the public interest.So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angelesto talk about the idea of a pro-social media companyand I was met with a lot of encouragement.One of the lines of encouragementthat I heard over and over was,"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,who think you're going to come to this town and make movies."And then of course, there was the other adage."The surest way to become a millionaireis to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."(Laughter)Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productionswith the vision to be a global media companyfocused on the public interest.And our mission is to produce entertainmentthat creates and inspires social change.And we don't just want people to see our moviesand say, that was fun, and forget about it.We want them to actually get involved in the issues.In 2005, we launched our first slate of films,"Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana"and "Good Night and Good Luck."And much to my surprise, they were noticed.We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.Perhaps more importantly,tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programsand the activism programsthat we created to go around the movies.And we had an online component of that,our community sect called Participate.net.But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and theSierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,there was actually something they could do to make a difference.One of these films in particular, called "North Country," was actuallykind of a box office disaster.But it was a film that starred Charlize Theronand it was about women's rights, women's empowerment,domestic violence and so on.And we released the film at the same time thatthe Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,and with our social sector partners,like the National Organization of Women,the film was widely creditedwith influencing the successful renewal of the act.And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's --the film started about a true-life storyabout a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,and the Violence Against Women Act and others.And then the movie about this person doing these things,then led to this greater renewal.And so again,it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al --I first saw Al do his slide show presentationon global warming in May of 2005.At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.And after we saw his slide show,it became clear that it was much more urgent.And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, andwith Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,and Davis Guggenheim,who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,because we felt that we could get the message out therefar more quickly than having Al go around the world,speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood,that nobody knows nothing about anything.And I really thought this was going to bea straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.And so it was a great shock to all of uswhen the film really captured the public interest,and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,and most of Scandinavia.We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.and it's really changed the debate on global warming.It was also a pretty good year for this guy.We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.(Laughter)And for Participant, this is just the start.Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.And we have 10 films in production right now,and dozens others in development.I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, andhow he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,"based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.And we think once people see these films,they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the worldand the Middle East in general.We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,Abby Hoffman and crew,and, again, a story about a small group of individualswho did make change in the world.And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carterand his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --(Laughter)-- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunityto make change in their own way.And all the people in this roomhave done so through their business lives,or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.And one thing that I've learnedis that there's never one right way to make change.One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,but every one of us is all of those things and more.And I believe if we do these things,we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.And I can imagine, if we do this,the headlines in 10 years might read something like these:"New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,""U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" --(Applause)-- "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence."(Applause)And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."(Laughter)And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.And I believe that, working together,we can make all of these things happen.And I want to thank you all for having me here today.It's been a real honor. Thank you.(Applause)Oh, thank you.

I really am honored to be here, and as Chris said,it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.I had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead,given away most everything that I owned,and arrived with all the essentials --some poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar --because I was going to save the world,and I thought I would just start with the African continent.But literally within days of arriving I was told, in no uncertain terms,by a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving,thank you very much, least of all not by me.I was too young, unmarried, I had no children,didn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.And so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life,and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well,so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda,and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986,to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.And I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere,meaning "to go forward with enthusiasm." And while we were doing it,I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viableand started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.And so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakerythat was run by 20 prostitutes.And, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group,and what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language,and how what we call people so often distances us from them,and makes them little.I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business,that, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person,who essentially spent 600 dollars a monthto keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods,and living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty.So, I made a deal with the women. I said, "Look, we get rid of the charity side,and we run this as a business and I'll help you."They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course,things are always harder than you think they're going to be.First of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team,and we clearly aren't the A-Team here,so let's -- I did all this training.And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streetsof Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket,and I sold all these little doughnuts to people,and I came back, and I was like, "You see?"And the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buydoughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?" And like --(Laughter) -- it's a good point.So then I went the whole American way,with competitions, team and individual. Completely failed,but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.And they started listening to the marketplace,and they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips,and sorghum bread, and before you knew it,we had cornered the Kigali market,and the women were earning three to four times the national average.And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery,so let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea."And I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?" And they said,"Well, you choose." And I said, "No, no, I'm learning to listen.You choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country -- not mine."But they wouldn't give me an answer.So, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by,and finally I said, "Well, how about blue?"And they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue."So, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all,and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains,and on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo,and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim,like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfyingas painting a wall of blue like a morning sky.So, blue, blue, everything became blue.The walls were blue, the windows were blue,the sidewalk out front was painted blue.And Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T,"the women's hips were swayingand little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.And at the end of it, we stood across the streetand we looked at what we had done, and I said, "It is so beautiful."And the women said, "It really is."And I said, "And I think the color is perfect,"and they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence,and I said, "What?"And she said, "Nothing." And I said, "What?"And she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green." And --(Laughter)-- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience,but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long,it's really hard to say what you mean.And, mostly because people never really ask you,and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting,but it's also learning how better to ask questions.And so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things,and it was an extraordinary time in my life.And it taught me three lessonsthat I think are so important for us today,and certainly in the work that I do.The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.As Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice,and that is fundamental to dignity.But as human beings, we also want to see each other,and we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.The second is that traditional charity and aidare never going to solve the problems of poverty.I think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point,which is that markets alone alsoare not going to solve the problems of poverty.Yes, we ran this as a business,but someone needed to pay the philanthropic supportthat came into the training, and the management support, the strategic adviceand, maybe most important of all,the access to new contacts, networks and new markets.And so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combinationof investment and philanthropy.And on a macro level -- some of the speakers have inferred thateven health should be privatized.But, having had a father with heart disease,and realizing that what our family could affordwas not what he should have gotten,and having a good friend step in to help,I really believe that all people deserve access to healthat prices they can afford.I think the market can help us figure that out,but there's got to be a charitable component,or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.And so, it was really those lessons that made me decide tobuild Acumen Fund about six years ago.It's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor,a few oxymorons in one sentence.It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations,and then we turn around and we invest equity and loansin both for-profit and nonprofit entitiesthat deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean waterto low income people in South Asia and Africa,so that they can make their own choices.We've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises,and have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs,and delivered tens of millions of services to peoplewho otherwise would not be able to afford them.I want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa.Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurswho are committed to service, and who really know the markets.Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise,and both of them, because they're manufacturers,create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly,because they're in the malaria sector,and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.And so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.The first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited.It's a company built in Kenya about seven years agoby an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.These are old-hand farmerswho've gone through all the agricultural ups and downsin Kenya over the last 30 years.Now, this plant is an Artemisia plant;it's the basic component for artemisinin,which is the best-known treatment for malaria.It's indigenous to China and the Far East,but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa,Patrick and his colleagues said, "Let's bring it here,because it's a high value-add product."The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.And so, using patient capital -- money that they could raise early on,that actually got below market returnsand was willing to go the long haul and be combinedwith management assistance, strategic assistance --they've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.So that's about 50,000 people affected.And I think some of you may have visited --these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe,who help them become more self-sufficient.They buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory,which was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis,who has a real interest in getting the powderso that they can make Coartem.Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half,both on looking at a new business plan,and what does expansion look like, helping with management supportand helping to do term sheets and raise capital.And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionallyin the last month or so. Because the company was literally10 days away from proving that the product they producedwas at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem,when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.And we called all of the social investors we know.Now, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africaand understand the importance of agriculture,and they even helped the farmers.And even when we explained that if ABE goes away,all those 7,500 jobs go away too,we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.So Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans,and the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are nowin the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level,and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa.This is Samuel. He's a farmer.He was actually living in the Kibera slumswhen his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.So he moved back to the farm, and, long story short,they now have seven acres under cultivation.Samuel's kids are in private school,and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production --dignity being more important than wealth.The next one, many of you know.I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago,and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing,which is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.And this is really a story about a public-private solutionthat has really worked.It started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technologyessentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide,so you could create a bed net,a malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.It could alter the vector, but like Artemisia,it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility,Sumitomo said, "Why don't we experimentwith whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?"UNICEF came forward and said, "We'll buy most of the nets,and then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund'sand the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free."Acumen came in with the patient capital,and we also helped to identify the entrepreneurthat we would all partner with here in Africa,and Exxon provided the initial resin.Well, in looking around for entrepreneurs,there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah,in A to Z manufacturing company.It's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania,and continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.And so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africato produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishmentto work with malaria.And, long story short, again, they've been so successful.In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.This year, they are now producing eight million nets a year,and they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.And so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa,and from a public health perspective, these are real successes.But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty,because it's not long-term sustainable.It's a company with one big customer.And if avian flu hits, or for any other reasonthe world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.And so, Anuj and Acumenhave been talking about testing the private sector,because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that,look, in a country like Tanzania,80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these,and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it,so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.And we said, "Well, there's another option.Let's use the market as the best listening device we have, andunderstand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.We can start building local distribution,and actually, it can cost the public sector much less."And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z,a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricingand listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.One, that people will pay different prices,but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per netand make a decision to buy it.And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to sayabout what they like and what they don't like.And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowedbecause of the patient capital,we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sectorto distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.So then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market,we have a choice.We can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero,or we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net,costing the public sector another six dollars a net,give the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution systemthat might, over time, start sustaining itself.We've got to start having conversations like this,and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market,but also to bring other people to the table around it.Whenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.She grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor,didn't have very much education.She moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather,who was a cement hauler,and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies.My grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop,making shirts for about 10 cents an hour.She, like so many of the women I see at A to Z,worked hard every day, understood what suffering was,had a deep faith in God, loved her childrenand would never have accepted a handout.But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace,and she lived in a society that provided the safetyof having access to affordable health and education,her children and their children were able to livelives of real purpose and follow real dreams.I look around at my siblings and my cousins -- and as I said,there are a lot of us --and I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers.One sister who makes other people's wishes come true.And my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers,and I think about all the people across this continentwho are working hard every day,is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility,and that they also can believe and get access to services,so that their children, too, can live those lives of great purpose.It shouldn't be that difficult.But what it takes is a commitment from all of usto essentially refuse trite assumptions,get out of our ideological boxes.It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committedto service as well as to success.It takes opening your arms, both, wide,and expecting very little love in return,but demanding accountability,and bringing the accountability to the table as well.And most of all, most of all,it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience,whether we are rich or poor, African or non-African,local or diaspora, left or right,to really start listening to each other.Thank you.(Applause)

Welcome to Africa! Or rather, I should say, welcome home.Because this is where it all really began, isn't it?Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years --it all points to evidence that lifefor the human species as we know it began right here.We are on an amazing journey the next four days.You're going to hear stories of "Africa: The Next Chapter."Fantastic tales, anecdotes from speakers.But I want to turn that upside down for a moment,and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say.What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa?And this is not a rhetorical question.I actually want answers from you.Go for it! The worst.Famine.Corruption.More.Genocide.AIDS.Slavery.That's enough.We've all heard these things.But this is about Africa, the story we have not heard.The stories that we want to know,and the stories that do exist about positive tales.A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunitiesthat exist on this continent,to separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction.To go to the actual data and statistics that existabout the actual things that are happening on the groundthat make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you.So let's get going because Africa,to some degree, is on a turnaround.A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image,and how it takes control of its own destiny.And turnarounds are part and parcelof what I have focused on for most of my professional career.And it all started almost a decade ago,as a young consultant at McKinsey &amp; Companyat their first African office in Johannesburg.And there we worked with leading CEOson African issues, and African companies on turnarounds,making the companies not just the best in Africabut the best globally.But I really formalized this focus on turnaroundswhen I was completing my MBA in the United States.It all began with a fantastic phone call.It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter,Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine.And she said, "I want to write a case, Euvin --a case on a public-sector leaderthat has lessons for the corporate world."And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela.Because Nelson Mandela, as he took over poweras the first democratically-elected president of South Africa,faced a situation of a countrythat could have slid into the abyss of chaos.But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle.Now the case, "Nelson Mandela: Change Leader,"became part of the research base for a chapterin Rosabeth's new book called "Confidence."And "Confidence" became a New York Times bestsellerand topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list.And why I tell you this story is because later, when I was interviewedon SABC Africa, on a pan-African broadcast, they asked,"What is your key lesson, or the key thing you enjoy the most?" --because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project.The lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story --that was used to share news with the rest of the worldof what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds.Africa was being used as a success story!So I want to share with you a personal storyabout a turnaround or a transformation.And that has to do with mebecause in 1994, I packed a few things into a backpackand headed off for a year of travelin the middle of my university career.You should have seen my parents' reaction!(Laughter)But very soon, I found myself from the southern part of Africa,in South Africa -- at the very north, in Egypt.And I sought out the most remote places.I went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops.And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things,but the key thing is that it was the placethat Alexander the Great went towhen he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him.And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert.Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm.And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle,and it foretold his destiny of greatness.This was 300 BC.So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers.Now, the thing I remember about Siwawas the magical view of the sky at night.With no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing placesthat when you look up you see a perfect tapestry.Fast forward to 2002.I'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusettsat the Healthcare Development Conference.And I see the same picture, but from the opposite side.A satellite picture looking down at the earth.And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on mebecause I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment.And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point.The first thing that I saw was North America at night --glowing, in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light.And then I saw it -- Africa. Quite literally the "Dark Continent."And while Africa may be dark,the thing that brought the message home to mewas that this is the challenge we are facing,but it's also the opportunity.Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specksthat exist north and in the south and other areas --it's aglow with the light in the heartsof the millions of people that are there.Entrepreneurs, dynamic people, people with hope.It was George Kimble, the geographer, who saidthat, "The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it."So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continentthat has so much to offer.Let's start unpacking it.Africa is the second-largest continent, a landmass second from Asia.It also is the second most populated continent,with 900 million people.In fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so bigthat you could fit in the continental United States,China, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space.Africa is home to over 1,000 languages --2,000 is another estimate that's out there --with over 2,000 languages and dialects.But you could say, "Invest in Africa in over 1,000 languages,and it wouldn't make a difference."What does the data say?As an investment banker, I'm in the cross-flow of informationand the changes that are taking place in capital markets.So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals, or signs,and winds of change that are sweeping this continent.So let's start on that.And let's start at the high level, on the macro-factors.Inflation, in general, is coming down across Africa --that's the first sign --in many countries reaching double-digit figures.So let's start looking at some of those.I call it my Z.E.N. cluster.Zambia: from 2004 to 2006, moves from the 18 percent in inflationto the nine percent.Egypt: from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent.Nigeria: a similar situation,from the 16 percent to the eight percent. Single digits.More fascinating, you have other countries -- South Africa,Mauritius, Namibia -- all in single digits.But that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies --currencies going through an extreme time of stability.But that's looking at the big picture.And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country.It's made up --(Applause)It's made up of 53 different countries.So the very definition -- to say "invest in Africa" is a no-go.It's meaningless.Each country has a unique value proposition.You can make money, you can lose money in Africa.But opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist.And this is what today is about --it's about discussing those very opportunities.So let's start getting into the countriesand into the specific material and data.I was recently elected, as Emeka mentioned,as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America.And I'm very proud and happy to be in that rolebecause it is a fascinating position to be in.To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity,of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come.So the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa.But not the South Africa we always talk about --the gold, the minerals, the First World infrastructure --a bit about the other side of it.For example, South Africa was recently voted as the top destinationfor the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers.Same language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense.Other headlines that have recently reached South Africawere Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity.Headline in South Africa: "They have landed." Quite ominous.But what were they there for? To acquire assets.Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon, a large retailer, is testimonyto the confidence they are starting to place in the economy.Because it is actually a long-term play.Being a retailer, it is a play on the beliefthat this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow,that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue.But the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africabecause there's so much happening.Undoubtedly, Nigeria is clearly a hot spot.Challenges -- and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days.But looking at Goldman Sachs' work -- we had the famous BRIC Report.The new report, "The Next Eleven," highlights that by 2020Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world.It's an investment opportunity. Think about that.Is anyone -- our banks, our investors --seriously thinking about going to Nigeria?If you haven't, why not?What's going on in Nigeria? A couple of things.I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets.Bellwether signs again.Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bondout of Africa, and this excludes South Africa.But the first Eurobond, the raising of international capitaloffshore, off its own balance sheet,without any sovereign backing --that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy.Without any sovereign backing,a Nigerian company raising capital offshore.It's just a sign of things to come.Looking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percentof the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent.It's an important strategic partner.Let's put Nigeria in perspective.2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day --the same league as Kuwait, the same league as Venezuela.But with Africa, let's start being careful about this.And Emeka and I have had these discussions.We have to move away from what's called "the curse of the commodities."Because it's not about oil, it's not about commodities.For Africa to truly be sustainable,we have to move beyond to other industries.So let's unpack those very quickly,and I'm going to move through these very, very, very fastbecause I can see that clock counting down.What else is going on there? Egypt.Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone --2.8 billion investment.The announcement just came out the last few weeks.Close to the Mediterranean, near Alexandria --textiles, petrochemicals.It's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company.So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouseacross the industries -- away from oil.Let's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry.What's going on there?In Tanzania last week, we had the launchof the East African Organic Produce Standard.Again, gathering together farmers, gathering together stakeholdersin East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices.It ties in with small-scale farmersin terms of no pesticides, no fertilizers.Again, opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price.Uganda: the New Forest Company,replanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important?As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [we will need]poles for rolling out electricity.But here is the sweetener in the deal.They're going to be tapping into carbon credits.Let's go back to Nigeria.The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation,from over 80 banks to 25 banks. Strengthening of the system.But what's going on there? Only 10 percent of the country is banked.The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.135 million-plus people. Think about that.There are only 700 ATMs in the country. Opportunity.The same for telecoms across the country.Now let's look at the continent as a whole.People look at the roads, for example, and they'd say,"Angola: 90 percent of roads are untarred. Ah, problem!"It's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up,inflation is affected.Nigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred. Zambia: 80 percent.In general, more than 50 percent of roads are untarred.This is an opportunity! Energy needs -- it's an opportunity.So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing?Let's look at the stock markets in Africa.If I had to ask you, "In 2005 what was the best performing stock marketor stock exchange in the world?" Would Egypt come to mind?In 2005, the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent.What's going on in some of the other countries?Let's look at some 2006 numbers. Kenya: over 60 percent. Nigeria: over 40 percent.South Africa: in the 20 percents. High ones.These are the trends that are taking place.But in any investment decision, the key question is,"What is my alternative investment?"Because in Africa today, we are competing globally for capital.And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties.There's an overhang of capital in the U.S., and the key is yield pickup.What Africa is providing is a diversification play,and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investorthat's aware of what he or she is doing.Now, when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things,and countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things,comparisons become important.10 years ago there, were very few countriesthat received sovereign ratings fromthe Standard &amp; Poors, Moody's and Fitch's.Today, 16 African countries and growinghave sovereign country ratings. What does this mean?Take Nigeria again: double B-minus --in the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison.The backbone of making investment decisionsfor global holders of capital.Some other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus.Bakino Faso: B-minus. And so on.In fact, one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa.Why are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow.So one of the big bellwethers,and one of my final points I want to mention, isthe interesting thing I read is that CNBChas launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this?It's the 24-hour rolling African news channel.They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen.Me and you, the investments we are going to be making,the investments the world is going to be making --that's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa.So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline.So in conclusion, I want to turn back to that very slidethat made such a deep impact on me all those years ago.This time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002,and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa,think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.Because there are amazing opportunities available.And think about the concept of transformationin the back of your mindbecause things can be turned around rather quickly.In 1899, Joseph Conrad released "The Heart of Darkness,"a tale of grim horror along the Congo River.If one looks carefully, on the Congo Riveris one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo rivergenerating light -- the old heart of darknessnow generating light with hydro-electric power.That is a transformation in power of ideas.So the next step, over the next four days,is us exploring more of these ideas.And perchance, if you can always keep this picture in your mind,that when we convene maybe in the distant future, in 2020,that picture will look very different.Thank you.(Applause)

It's very, very difficultto speak at the end of a conference like this,because everyone has spoken. Everything has been said.So I thought that what may be useful is to remind usof some of the things that have gone on here,and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away,and take forward and work on.That's what I'd like to try and do.We came here saying we want to talk about "Africa: the Next Chapter."But we are talking about "Africa: the Next Chapter"because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we're looking at,and saying it's not such a good thing.The picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and diseaseis what we usually see.What we want to look at is "Africa: the Next Chapter,"and that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African.And I think it's worth remembering what we've heardthrough the conference right from the first day,where I heard that all the important statistics have been given --about where we are now,about how the continent is doing much better.And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.So I'm not going to spend too much time --just to show you, refresh your memoriesthat we are here for "Africa: the Next Chapter" because for the first timethere really is a platform to build on.We really do have it going rightthat the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.After decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent,and it's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even.And inflation has come down.External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story aboutbecause I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent --has come down dramatically.You know, as you can see,from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.Now this is a huge achievement.You know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important?It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currenciesand gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a differencebecause private investment flows have increased.I want to remind you again --I know you saw these statistics before --from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.In 2005, remittances -- I just took one country, Nigeriaskyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic,but increasing dramatically.And in many other countries this is happening.Why is this important? Because it shows confidence.People are now confident to bring --if your people in the diaspora bring their money back,it shows other people that, look,there is emerging confidence in your country.And instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.Now, why is all this important, to have to go really fast?It's important that we build this platform,that we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying,"Look, we must do something different."Because we are confronted with a challenge.62 percent of our population is below the age of 24.What does this mean?This means that we have to focus on how our youthare going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives.You have to focus on how to create jobs,make sure they don't fall into disease, and that they get an education.But most of all that they are productively engaged in life,and that they are creating the kind of productive environmentin our countries that will make things happen.And to support this, I just recently --one of the things I've done since leaving governmentis to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria.Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research.People don't have voice.There is no way you can know what people want.One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.Like in every other country where this has been done,jobs is the top issue.I want to leave this up here and come back to it.But before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this.And to say that for me, the next stage of building this platformthat now enables us to move forward --and we mustn't make light of it.It was only 5, 6, 7 years agowe couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter.We were going nowhere.The economies were not growing.We were having negative per capita growth.The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forwardwas not even there.So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this,including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.Creating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption,building institutions, stabilizing the micro economy.So now we have this platform we can build on.And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here:aid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc.And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating thingsis that it's been a simplistic debate.And that's not what the debate should be about.That's engaging in the wrong debate.The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors,the private sector and ordinary African peopletaking charge of their own lives?How do we combine all this?To move our continent forward, to do the things that need doingthat I talked about -- getting young people employed.Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent,much of what you have seen here.So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate.We need to bring it back to say,what is the combination of all these factorsthat is going to yield what we want? (Applause)And I want to tell you something.For me, the issue about aid --I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other sideand feel bad about aid.Africa has been giving the other countries aid.Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at thathe dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid.And I said, "Mo, you're right. We have -- no, but we've already been doing it!The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid."(Applause)It is all the resources that were taken from Africa,including human, that built these countries today!So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.The issue is not that.The issue is how are we using what has been given back.How are we using it?Is it being directed effectively?I want to tell you a little story.Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.From 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war.And in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old.We spent much of our time with my mother cooking.For the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army.We were on the Biafran side.And we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place,but wherever we could help we did.At a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad.We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.People, children were dying of kwashiorkor.I'm sure some of you who are not so youngwill remember those pictures.Well, I was in the middle of it.In the midst of all this, my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days.We thought she was going to die.My father was not there.He was in the army.So I was the oldest person in the house.My sister fell very ill with malaria.She was three years old and I was 15.And she had such a high fever. We tried everything.It didn't look like it was going to work.Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who waslooking at people and giving them meds.Now I put my sister on my back -- burning --and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.It was really hot. I was very hungry.I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.I got there and I saw huge crowds.Almost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in?I had to crawl in between the legs of these peoplewith my sister strapped on my back,find a way to a window.And while they were trying to break down the door,I climbed in through the window, and jumped in.This woman told me it was in the nick of time.By the time we jumped into that hall, she was barely moving.She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then --gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration --and some other therapies, and put us in a corner.In about two to three hours, she started to move.And then they toweled her down because she started sweating,which was a good sign.And then my sister woke up.And about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.I strapped her on my back.I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.I was so happy -- (Applause) -- that my sister was alive!Today she's 41 years old, a mother of three,and she's a physician saving other lives.Why am I telling that? I'm telling you that because --when it is you or your person involved --you don't care where -- whether it's aid.You don't care what it is! (Applause)You just want the person to be alive!And now let me become less sentimental, and say that saving lives --which some of the aid we get does on this continent --when you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother,they are contributing productively into the economy.And as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story.These are people who are productive agents in the economy.So if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria,it means they can form the base of production for our economy.And by the same token --as someone said yesterday -- if we don't and they die,their children will become a burden on the economy.So even from an economic standpoint,if we leave the social and the humanitarian,we need to save lives now.So that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I saylet's channel these resources we get into something productive.However, I will also tell you that I'm one of thosewho doesn't believe that this is the sole answer.That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.You know, we have to use it well.What has happened in Europe?Do you all know that Spain -- part of the EU --got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU?Resources that were transferred to them --and were the Spanish ashamed of this? No!The EU transferred 10 billion. Where did they use it?Have you been to southern Spain lately? There are roads everywhere.Infrastructure everywhere.It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spainhas developed into a services economy.Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid?Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today.For which many people, even from other parts of the world,are going there to find jobs.What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid?They used it to build an information superhighway,gain infrastructure thatenables them to participate in theinformation technology revolution,and to create jobs in their economy.They didn't say, "No, you know, we're not going to take this."Today, the European Union is busy transferring aid.My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain --which is roads, highways, other things that they can build --I say then, why do they refuse to use the same aidto build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause)When we ask them and tell them what we need,one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.Now we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all thatand the EU.We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money --some of them in this audience, with private foundations.And one day, these foundations have so much money,they will overtake the official aid that is being given.But I fear -- and I'm very grateful to all of themfor what they are trying to do on the continent --but I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my bellybecause I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.And they're also going from country to country,and many times trying to find what to do.But I'm not really sure that their assistanceis also being channeled in the right way.And many of them are not really familiar with the continent.They are just discovering.And many times I don't see Africans working with them.They are just going alone! (Applause)And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interestedin hearing from Africans who might know.They want to visit us,see what's happening on the ground and make a decision.And now I'm maybe being harsh.But I worry because this money is so important.Now, who are they accountable to?Are we on their boards when they make decisionsabout where to channel money? Are we there?Will we make the same mistake that we made before?Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about --have they ever called these people together and said,"Look, your foundation and your foundation --you have so much money, we are grateful.Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeledand where this aid should go."Have we done that? The answer is no.And each one is making their own individual effort.And then 10 years from now, billions will again have gone into Africa,and we would still have the same problems.This is what gives us the hopeless image.Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money,"Sit down."And we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate.We've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros,and everybody else who is helping and say,"Sit down. Let's have a conference with you.As a continent, here are our priorities.Here is where we want you to channel this money."Each one should not be an entrepreneurgoing out and finding what is best.We're not trying to stop them at all! But to help them help us better.And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this.Ten years from now we will have the same story,and we will be repeating the same things.So our problem right now is, how can we leverageall this good will that is coming towards our way?How can we get government to combine properlywith these private foundations, with the international organizations,and with our private sector.I firmly believe in that private sector thing too.But it cannot do it alone.So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas.So why don't we think of using some of this aid?Well, why don't we first say to those helping us out,"Don't be shy about infrastructure.That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure.That education will work betterif we've got electricity and railroads, and so on.That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market.Don't be shy of it.Invest some of your resources in that, too."And then we can see that this is one combinationof private, international, multilateral money,private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership,so that aid can be a facilitator.That is all aid can be.Aid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic,we would have failed.One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now --one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupidand China is coming to take resources.It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese.If you tell them, "We need a road here,"they will help you build it.They don't shy away from infrastructure.In fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me,when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria.He said, "There are two things you need only.Infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.You are undisciplined." (Applause)And I repeat it for the continent.It's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.Now I realize -- I'm not saying -- health and education --no, you can also provide that as well.But I'm saying it's not either or.Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership.One idea.Second thing, for the private sector,people are afraid to take risks on the continent.Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms,to enable people to take risk?(Applause)And finally, because they are both standing at my -- I'm out of time.Am I out of time?OK, so let me not forget my punchline.One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on isto support women, to create jobs. (Applause)A lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.But there are people -- women -- creating jobs.And we know, studies have shownthat when you put resources in the hand of the woman --in fact, there's an econometric study,the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing thattransfers into the hands of women resultin healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here --I'm not saying the men are not important --obviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do?They'll come back home and get disgruntled,and it will result in difficulties we don't want.We don't want men beating their wivesbecause they don't have a job, and so on.But at the margin, we also -- I want to push this,because the reason is the men automatically --they get -- not automatically, but they tend to get more support.But I want you to realize that resourcesin the hands of African women is a powerful tool.There are people creating jobs.Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company.She wants to expand.She needs another 20 million.She will create another 100, 200 more jobs.So take away from here is how are you going to put togetherthe resources to put money in the hands of women in the middlewho are ready --business people who want to expand and create more jobs.And lastly, what are you going to doto be part of this partnership of aid, government, private sectorand the African as an individual?Thank you. (Applause)

Well, first of all, let me thank Emeka -- as a matter of fact,TED Global -- for putting this conference together.This conference is going to rank as the most importantin the beginning of the 21st century.Think African governments will put together a conference like this?You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this?Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid.I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED FellowsJune Arunga, James Shikwati, Andrew, and the other TED Fellows.I call them the Cheetah Generation.The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africanswho brook no nonsense about corruption.They understand what accountability and democracy is.They're not going to wait for government to do things for them.That's the Cheetah Generation,and Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs.In contrast, of course, we have the Hippo Generation.(Laughter)The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites.They are stuck in their intellectual patch.Complaining about colonialism and imperialism,they wouldn't move one foot.If you ask them to reform the economies,they're not going to reform itbecause they benefit from the rotten status quo.Now, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry,angry at the condition of Africa.Now, we're talking about a continent that is not poor.It is rich in mineral resources, natural mineral resources.But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilizedto lift its people out of poverty.That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry.And in a way, Africa is more than a tragedy, in more ways than one.There's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is thatthere are so many people, so many governments,so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa.They don't understand.Now, we're not saying don't help Africa.Helping Africa is noble.But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd.It's like the blind leading the clueless.(Laughter)There are certain things that we need to recognize.Africa's begging-bowl leaks.Did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africais not invested here in Africa?It's taken out of Africa.That's what the World Bank says.Look at Africa's begging-bowl.It leaks horribly.There are people who think that we should pour more money,more aid into this bowl which leaks.What are the leakages?Corruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year.Yes, put that aside.Capital flight out of Africa, 80 billion a year.Put that aside.Let's take food imports.Every year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food.Just add that up, all these leakages.That's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa.Now, back in the 1960s Africa not only fed itself,it also exported food.Not anymore.We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong.You know it, I know it, but let's not waste our timetalking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here.Let's move on, and flip over to the next chapter,and that's what this conference is all about -- the next chapter.The next chapter begins with first of all, asking ourselvesthis fundamental question,"Whom do we want to help in Africa?"There is the people, and then there is the government or leaders.Now, the previous speaker before me,Idris Mohammed, indicated thatwe've had abysmal leadership in Africa.That characterization, in my view, is even more charitable.(Laughter)I belong to an Internet discussion forum,an African Internet discussion forum,and I asked them, I said, "Since 1960, we've had exactly204 African heads of state, since 1960."And I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders,just 20 good leaders --you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself.I asked them to name me just 20.Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela, of course.Kwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned Idi Amin.(Laughter)I let that pass.(Laughter)My point is, they couldn't go beyond 15.Even if they had been able to name me 20,what does that tell you?20 out of 204 means that the vast majorityof the African leaders failed their people.And if you look at them, the slate of the post-colonial leaders --an assortment of military fufu heads,Swiss-bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites,quack revolutionaries.(Applause)Now, this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leadersthat Africans have known for centuries.The second false premise that we makewhen we're trying to help Africais that sometimes we think that there is something calleda government in Africa that cares about its people,serves the interests of the people, and represents the people.There is one particular quote -- a Lesotho chief once saidthat "Here in Lesotho, we've got two problems:rats and the government."(Laughter)What you and I understand as a governmentdoesn't exist in many African countries.In fact, what we call our governments are vampire states.Vampires because they suckthe economic vitality out of their people.Government is the problem in Africa.A vampire state is the government --(Applause)-- which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crookswho use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves,their cronies, and tribesmen and exclude everybody else.The richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers,and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself.Where do they get their money?By creating wealth?No.By raking it off the backs of their suffering people.That's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution.The third fundamental issue that we have to recognizeis that if we want to help the African people,we must know where the African people are.Take any African economy.An African economy can be broken up into three sectors.There is the modern sector, there is the informal sectorand the traditional sector.The modern sector is the abode of the elites.It's the seat of government.In many African countries the modern sector is lost.It's dysfunctional.It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems,which the elites themselves don't understand.That is the source of many of Africa's problemswhere the struggles for political power emanateand then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector,claiming innocent lives.Now the modern sector, of course,is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.More than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's developmentwent into the modern sector.The other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors,are where you find the majority of the African people,the real people in Africa. That's where you find them.Now, obviously it makes common sensethat if you want to help the people, you go where the people are.But that's not what we did.As a matter of fact,we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors.Now, traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture,which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself,and that's why it must import food.All right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoringthe informal and the traditional sectors.And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectorswithout an operational understanding of how these two sectors work.These two sectors, let me describe to you,have their own indigenous institutions.First one is the political system.Traditionally, Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny.If you look into their traditional systems,Africans organize their states in two types.The first one belongs to those ethnic societieswho believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous,so they didn't want to have anything to dowith any centralized authority.These societies are the Ibo, the Somali, the Kikuyus,for example. They have no chiefs.The other ethnic groups, which did have chiefs,made sure that they surrounded the chiefswith councils upon councils upon councilsto prevent them from abusing their power.In Ashanti tradition, for example,the chief cannot make any decisionwithout the concurrence of the council of elders.Without the council the chief can't pass any law,and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the peoplehe will be removed.If not, the people will abandon the chief,go somewhere else and set up a new settlement.And even if you look in ancient African empires,they were all organized around one particular principle --the confederacy principle,which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority,decentralization of power.Now, this is what I have described to you.This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage.Now, compare that to the modern systemsthe ruling elites established on Africa.It is a total far cry.In the economic system in traditional Africa,the means of production is privately owned.It's owned by extended families.You see, in the West, the basic economic and social unitis the individual.The American will say, "I am because I am,and I can damn well do anything I want, anytime."The accent is on the "I."In Africa, the Africans say, "I am, because we are."The "we" connotes community -- the extended family system.The extended family system pools its resources together.They own farms. They decide what to do, what to produce.They don't take any orders from their chiefs.They decide what to do.And when they produce their crops, they sell the surpluson marketplaces.When they make a profit it is theirs to keep,not for the chief to sequester it from them.So, in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africawas a free-market system.There were markets in Africabefore the colonialists stepped foot on the continent.Timbuktu was one great big market town.Kano, Salaga -- they were all there.Even if you go to West Africa, you notice that market activityin West Africa has always been dominated by women.So, it's quite appropriate that this section is calleda marketplace.The market is not alien to Africa.What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism,but then after independence, all of a sudden,markets, capitalism became a western institution,and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism.Nonsense.And even then, what kind of socialism did they practice?The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form ofSwiss-bank socialism,which allowed the heads of states and the ministersto rape and plunder Africa'streasuries for deposit in Switzerland.That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries.What do we do now?Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions,and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors,the traditional sectors.That's where you find the African people.And I'd like to show you a quick little videoabout the informal sector, about the boat-buildingthat I, myself, tried to mobilize Africans in the Diasporato invest in.Could you please show that?The men are going fishing in these small boats.Yes, it's an enterprise.This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur, using his own capital.He's getting no assistance from the government,and he's building a second, bigger boat.A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed.It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians.It also means that he will be able to generate wealth.And then it will have what economists callexternal effects on a local economy.All that you need to do, all that the elites need to do,is to move this operation into something that is enclosedso that the operation can be made more efficient.Now, it is not just this informal sector.There is also traditional medicine.80 percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine.The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed.Now, this is an area -- I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealthin the traditional medicine area.This is where we need to mobilize Africans,in the Diaspora especially, to invest in this.We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora,not only to go into the traditional sectors,but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within.We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diasporato instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana.And I know that with the Cheetahs, we can take Africa backone village at a time.Thank you very much.(Applause)

Thank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up heresaid they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared,but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.(Laughter)What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of storiesand talk about a different Africa.Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africathat you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS,the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict,and the Africa of disasters.While it is true that those things are going on,there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.This is the Africa of opportunity.This is the Africa where people want to take charge oftheir own futures and their own destinies.And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnershipsto do this. That's what I want to talk about today.And I want to start by telling youa story about that change in Africa.On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha,a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria,was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollarsthat went into some dormant accountsthat belonged to him and his family.This arrest occurred because there was cooperationbetween the London Metropolitan Policeand the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria --led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a womanand ran from London back to Nigeria where,according to our constitution, those in officeas governors, president -- as in many countries --have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened:people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possiblefor his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.Today, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail.This is a story about the fact that people in Africaare no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.This is a story about the fact that people want their resourcesmanaged properly for their good, and not taken out to placeswhere they'll benefit just a few of the elite.And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa --corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the peopleand the governments are trying hard to fight thisin some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.Does it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.So when you hear about corruption,don't just feel that nothing is being done about this --that you can't operate in any African countrybecause of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoingand is being won. In others, like mine,where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria,the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.But the truth of the matter is that this is going on.The results are showing:independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizationsshow that in many instances the trend is downwardsin terms of corruption, and governance is improving.A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showeda clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.And let me say just one more thingbefore I leave this area of governance.That is that people talk about corruption, corruption.All the time when they talk about ityou immediately think about Africa.That's the image: African countries. But let me say this:if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London --if the other people who had taken money, estimated at20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' moniessitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this,what is that? Is that not corruption?In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also thinkabout what is happening on the other side of the globe --where the money's going and what can be done to stop it.I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank,on asset recovery, trying to do what we canto get the monies that have been taken abroad --developing countries' moneys -- to get that sent back.Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back,it may be far more for some of these countriesthan all the aid that is being put together.(Applause)The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.Africans, after -- they're tired, we're tiredof being the subject of everybody's charity and care.We are grateful, but we know thatwe can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.And what is happening in many African countries now is a realizationthat no one can do it but us. We have to do it.We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.We have to reform our economies, change our leadership,become more democratic, be more open to change and to information.And this is what we started to doin one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.I want to tell you that.(Laughter)One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian,and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people --but very interesting people. You'll never be bored.(Laughter)What we started to do was to realizethat we had to take charge and reform ourselves.And with the support of a leaderwho was willing, at the time, to do the reforms,we put forward a comprehensive reform program,which we developed ourselves.Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank,where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.We put together a program that would, one: get the stateout of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.The state should not be in the businessof producing goods and servicesbecause it's inefficient and incompetent.So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.(Applause)We -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.Can you believe that prior to this reform --which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washingtonto go and take up the post of Finance Minister --we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?(Laughter)Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.You couldn't get it. You had to bribe.You had to do everything to get your phone.When President Obasanjo supported and launchedthe liberalization of the telecommunications sector,we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world,after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a yearin telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.(Laughter)The smartest one, first to come in,was the MTN company of South Africa.And in the three years that I was Finance Minister,they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country,with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.So the market is there.When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.Nigerians themselves began to developsome wireless telecommunications companies,and three or four others have come in.But there's a huge market out there,and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.So privatization is one of the things we've done.The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.Because nobody's going to help you and support youif you're not managing your own finances well.And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputationof being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rulethat de-linked our budget from the oil price.Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in,because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sectorin the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.We de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budgetat a price slightly lower than the oil priceand save whatever was above that price.We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.But what it immediately did was that the volatilitythat had been present in terms of our economic development --where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.When they crashed, we crashed.And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left,27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves --when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. Andas we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reservesdue to proper management of our finances.And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the timeis now fairly stable and being managed so that business peoplehave a predictability of prices in the economy.We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decadeto about 6.5 percent now.So all the changes and reforms we were able to makehave shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.And what is more important, because we want to get away from oiland diversify -- and there are so many opportunitiesin this one big country, as in many countries in Africa --what was remarkable is that much of this growth camenot from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.Agriculture grew at better than eight percent.As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction,and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you thatonce you get the macro-economy straightened out,the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of mineralsthat no one has even invested in or explored. And we realizedthat without the proper legislation to make that possible,that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining codethat is comparable with some of the best in the world.We have opportunities in housing and real estate.There was nothing in a country of 140 million people --no shopping malls as you know them here.This was an investment opportunity for someonethat excited the imagination of people.And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mallare doing four times the turnover that they had projected.So, huge things in construction, real estate,mortgage markets. Financial services:we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiringthat they increase their capital -- share capital.And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.The banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengtheningof the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million.And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.We are doing the same with the insurance sector.So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.And that's what many people know East Africa for:the wildlife, the elephants, and so on.But managing the tourism market in a waythat can really benefit the people is very important.So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell youthat there's a new wave on the continent.A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000,more than two-thirds of African countries have hadmulti-party democratic elections.Not all of them have been perfect, or will be,but the trend is very clear.I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years,the average rate of growth on the continent has movedfrom about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.This is better than the performance of many OECD countries.So it's clear that things are changing.Conflicts are down on the continent;from about 12 conflicts a decade ago,we are down to three or four conflicts --one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect whereif something is going on in one part of the continent,it looks like the entire continent is affected.But you should know that this continent is not --is a continent of many countries, not one country.And if we are down to three or four conflicts,it means that there are plenty of opportunities to investin stable, growing, exciting economieswhere there's plenty of opportunity.And I want to just make one point about this investment.The best way to help Africans todayis to help them to stand on their own feet.And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in thatand saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employedand make sure that their children go to school,that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.If we can invest in places where you yourselves make moneywhilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet,isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?And I want to say that some of the best people to invest inon the continent are the women.(Applause)I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.It says, "Africa: Open for Business."And this is a video that has actually won an awardas the best documentary of the year.Understand that the woman who made itis going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, whoagainst all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.One of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi,making children's clothes --which she started as a hobby and grew into a business.Mixing African materials, such as we have,with materials from elsewhere.So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys,with African material mixed in. Very creative designs,has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.(Laughter)For 10,000 pieces.So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.I could go on giving examples:Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower businessand is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morningand is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.However, many of these are starved for capital to expand,because nobody believes outside of our countriesthat we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.Nobody thinks there's opportunity.But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now,will miss it forever.So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world,who are doing incredible things, that are bringing theminto the global economy, whilst at the same time making surethat their fellow men and women are employed,and that the children in those households get educatedbecause their parents are earning adequate income.So I invite you to explore the opportunities.When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully,because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will befor you to get involved in something that will do goodfor the continent, for the people and for yourselves.Thank you very much.(Applause)

Basically, there's a major demographic event going on.And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban pointis an economic tipping point. So the world now is a map of connectivity.It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities.What we have now is the end of the rise of the West. That's over.The aggregate numbers are overwhelming.So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying out.The question is, why?And here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free,they said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to placeslike Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule.And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.They're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers.They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai.They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.Education is the main event that can happen in cities.What's going on in the street in Mumbai?Al Gore knows. It's basically everything.There's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works.One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that.So here's the first punch line:cities have defused the population bomb.And here's the second punch line.That's the news from downtown. Here it is in perspective.Stars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years.Now we're shining right back up.Thank you.

Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a questionI know that's been pressing on many of your minds.We spoke to you last several years ago.And before I get started today,since many of you are wondering,I just wanted to get it out of the way.The answer is boxers.Now I hope all of you feel better.Do you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is?Audience: Yes.SB: What is it?Audience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.SB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it.But this is what helped me see it.This is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.Here it's slightly logged.But here you can see around the worldhow people are using Google.And every one of those rising dotsrepresents probably about 20, 30 searches,or something like that.And they're labeled by color right now, by language.So you can see: here we are in the U.S.,and they're all coming up red.There we are in Monterey -- hopefully I can get it right.You can see that Japan is busy at night,right there.We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.There's a lot of activity in China.There's a lot of activity in India.There's some in the Middle East, the little pockets.And Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.Now you can also see, if I turn this around here --hopefully I won't shake the world too much.But you can also see, there are places where there's not so much.Australia, because there just aren't very many people there.And this is something that we should really work on,which is Africa, which is just a few trickles,basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.But basically, what we've noticed is these queries,which come in at thousands per second,are available everywhere there is power.And pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.And even in Antarctica -- well, at least this time of year --we from time to time will see a query rising up.And if we had it plotted correctly,I think the International Space Station would have it, too.So this issome of the challenge that we have here,is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the --there we go.This is how we have to move the bits aroundto actually get the people the answers to their questions.You can see that there's a lot of data running around.It has to go all over the world: through fibers,through satellites, through all kinds of connections.And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latenciesas low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.But you can see also, once again -- so some places are much more wiredthan others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.,going up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.Now what I would like to do is just to show youwhat one second of this activity would look like.And if we can switch to slides --all right, here we go.So this is slowed down.This is what one second looks like.And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing,is just making sure that we can keep upwith this kind of traffic load.Now, each one of those querieshas an interesting life and tale of its own.I mean, it could be somebody's health,it could be somebody's career, something important to them.And it could potentially be somethingas important as tomato sauce,or in this case, ketchup.So this is a query that we had --I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.You can see that it got started right here.In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S.as it did in Spain.And then from Spain, it went to Italy,and then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.And so I guess the U.S. finally,finally started to like it, too.And I just wanted to play it for you.Anyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves --hopefully that search will work.As a part of --you know, part of what we want to do to grow our companyis to have more searches.And what that means is we want to havemore people who are healthy and educated.More animals, if they start doing searches as well.But partly, we want to make the world a better place,and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation,and we're in the process of setting that up.We also have a program already called Google Grantsthat now serves over 150 different charities around the world,and these are some of the charities that are on there.And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of.In fact, many of the organizations that are here --the Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet --and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants.They run Google ads, and we just give them the ad creditso they can let organizations know.One of the earlier results that we got --we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a villageof 25 Vietnamese girls for their education,and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have beenmany, many stories that have come in,because we do have hundreds of charities in there,and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.Now does anybody know who this is?A-ha!Audience: Orkut.SB: Yes! Somebody got it.This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?Do we have any?Okay, not very many people know about it.I'll explain it in a second.This is one of our engineers.We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves.That's how we churn those products out.Orkut had a vision to create a social network.I know all of you are thinking, "Yet another social network."But it was a dream of his, and we, basically,when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them.So this is what he built.We just released it in a test phase last month,and it's been taking off.This is our VP of Engineering.You can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there.And these are all of his friends.So this is how -- we just deployed it --we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service,and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out.And now we've grown to over 100,000 members.And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S.You can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here --though, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic --but it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe,and all the rest of the countries.So it's a fun little project.There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for funand see where it goes.And --well, I'll leave you in suspense.Larry, you can explain this one.Larry Page: Thank you, Sergey.So one of the things -- both Sergey and Iwent to a Montessori school,and I think, for some reason,this has been incorporated in Google.And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that,you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time,and we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as "the 20 percent time,"and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time,if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.And many, many things at Google have come out of that,such as Orkut and also Google News.And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics --as a hobby, basically.So many, many useful things come out of this.And News, which I just mentioned,was started by a researcher.And he just -- he -- after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.And he said, "Why don't I look at the news better?"And so he started clustering it by category,and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom,we made it a Googlette,which is basically a small project at Google.So it'd be like three people, or something like that,and they would try to make a product.And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of peopleworking on it for a while, and then more and more peoplestarted using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,and more and more people started using it.And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.And this is how we keep our innovation running.I think usually, as companies get bigger,they find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,"Oh, we really need a new concept."You know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not,but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them,some of them will really work and turn out, such as News.But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.And I don't know about all of you,but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.And we found that if we just wrote all of them downand ordered them -- and these are kind of made up.Don't really pay attention to them.For example, the "Buy Iceland" was from a media article.We would never do such a crazy thing, but --in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them,that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.And this was kind of a surprise to me, butwe found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,which you did by writing them down,that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to doand where to put your resources.And so that's basically what we've donesince we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovativeand still stay reasonably well-organized.The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important,and so naturally,people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.I just wanted to highlight a couple of thingsthat are new, or you might not know about.And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar?Raise your hands.How many of you use the Deskbar?All right, see? You guys should try it out.But if you go to our site and searchfor "Deskbar," you'll get this.And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the timeon your screen on the bottom,and you can do searches really easily.And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar.Thank you, Sergey.This is another example of a project that somebody at Googlewas really passionate about, and they just, they got going,and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off.Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool,which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars,you can type a question in,and then there's a pool of researchersthat go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that,and you can get actually very good answers to thingswithout spending all that time yourself.Froogle lets you search shopping information,and Blogger lets you publish things.But all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that --you know, we try many, many different thingsin our company.We also like to innovate in our physical space,and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long timefor projectors to turn on and off,and they're noisy, so people shut them off.And we didn't like that, so we actually,in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosuresthat enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the timeand they're completely silent.And as a result, we were able to build some softwarethat also lets us manage a meeting,so when you walk into a meeting room now,it lists all the meetings that are happening,you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automaticallyto all the people that were present in the meeting.And as we become more of a global company,we find these things really affect us --you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference.We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings,and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should.And so we found it was pretty helpfulto have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...we also allow dogs and things like that,and we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company,which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing.This is actually our "cult picture."I just wanted to show quickly.We had this on our website for a while,but we found that after we put it on our website,we didn't get any job applications anymore.But anyway, every year we've takenthe whole company on a ski trip.A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally.And I think we've done a good job encouraging that.It makes it a really fun place to work.Along with our logos, too, which I think really embodyour culture when we change things.In the early days, we were actually advisedwe should never change our logo becausewe should establish our brand, you know,because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.You want it to be consistent.And we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.Why don't we try changing it every day?"One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing nowis we have this thing called AdSense,and this is a little bit foreshadowing --this is from before Dean dropped out.But the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,we show you relevant ads.And this is hard to read, but this says "Battle for New Hampshire:Howard Dean for President" -- articles on Howard Dean.And these ads are generated automatically --like in this case, on the Washington Post --from the content on the site.And so we use our over 150,000 advertisersand millions of advertisements, so we pick the onethat's most relevant to what you're actually looking at,much as we do on search.So the idea is we can make advertising useful,not just annoying, right?And the nice thing about this,we have a self-serve program,and many thousands of websites have signed up,and this let's them really make money. And I --you know, there's a number of people I met --I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party,and he said, "You know, I wasn't making any money.I just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.And, you know, thank you.I don't have to do my other job now."And I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better.It makes content get better, it makes searching work better,when people can really make their livelihoodfrom producing great content.So this session is supposed to be about the future,so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it.And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search,you really have to be smart.Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google,and you expect an answer back, right?But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.It would be artificial intelligence.And so that's something we work on,and we even have some people who are excited enoughand crazy enough to work on it now,and that's really their goal.So we always hope that Google will be smart,but we're always surprised when other people think that it is.And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.This is a blog from Iraq,and it's not really whatI'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example.Maybe, Sergey, you can highlight this.So we decided --actually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.So, "related searches," right there. You can't see it that well,but we decided we should put in this featureinto our AdSense ads, called "related searches."And so we'd say, you know, "Did you mean 'search for'" -- what is this,in this case, "Saddam Hussein," because this blog is about Iraq --and you know, in addition to the ads,and we thought this would be a great idea.And so there is this blogof a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said,"You know, I'm sleeping a lot."He was just kind of writing about his life.And our algorithms -- not a person, of course,but our algorithms, our computers --read his blog and decided thatthe related search was, "I am bored."And he read this, and he thought a person had decidedthat he was boring,and it was very unfortunate,and he said, "You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing?Why don't they like my blog?"And so then we read his blog, which was getting -- you know,sort of going from bad to worse,and we said the related search was, "Retards."And then, you know, he got even more mad,and he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on.And then we produced "You suck."And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart,and of course, you know,we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out,and it didn't quite work,and we don't have this feature anymore.So with that, maybe I can switch back to the world.I wanted to end just by saying thatthere's a couple things that really make me excitedto be involved with Google,and one of those is that we're able to make moneylargely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from thatwas that we're able to serve everyone in the worldwithout worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.So we don't have to worry about our products being sold,for example, for less money in places that are poor,and then they get re-imported into the U.S. --for example, with the drug industry.And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business modelbecause everyone in the world has access to our search,and I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit.The other thing I wanted to mention just brieflyis that we have a tremendous ability and responsibilityto provide people the right information,and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine --that we should provide very objective information.And so in our search results, we never accept payment for our search results.We accept payment for advertising,and we mark it as such.And that's unlike many of our competitors.And I think decisions we're able to make like thathave a tremendous impact on the world,and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.So thank you.

I'd like to speak about technology trends,which is something that many of you follow --but we also follow, for related reasons.Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trendsare something that we write about and need to know about.But also it's part of being any monthly magazine --you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.We have to plan issues many months in advance;we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.We also, like a lot of companies, create a productthat's based on technology trends.In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky,some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.And so we have to understandnot only why tech's important, where it's going,but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions madeduring the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce,or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising,they were all right -- they were just wrong in time.Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuationsis obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.You've probably seen something like this before.This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks aboutkind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it,to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,or whether they were about to crashinto the trough of disillusionment,or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a senseof where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important;we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that,we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologiesare going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.And then it's time to do it again. Last year.And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trendsthat I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future,"but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.It's based on the presumption, the observation even,that all important technologies go through four stages in their life --at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision --a collision with something else --for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technologyand also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.And these are the inflection points that tell youwhat the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,and maybe how you can do something about it.The first is the critical price.The first stage in a technology's advanceis that it'll fall below a critical price.After it falls below a critical price, it will tend,if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology,and that's another important point.And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it;it's an opportunity for the technology to change.And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi --you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass,but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet --there's still more opportunity in that.I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by thisby telling the story of the DVD,which is a technology which has done all of these.The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990sand it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998,it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.And it started to take off. And you can see that the unitsstarted to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case,20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.And what's interesting hereis that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.Suddenly you have a DVD in the house;you've got high-quality digital video;you have a reason to have a big-screen television;you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them,and bring the rest of your entertainment in.What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment,that was an inflection point that he could do something with.The next phase it hit was displacement.You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVDin a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small;you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.That gave an advantage; that was an implicationof the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.And then finally, DVDs are approaching free.There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm,who has, several times in the past year, been the number-oneDVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.You're aware of theperhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampedeover the 30-dollar DVD.But they're getting very, very cheap,and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper,the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share,and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.They're being commodified, and that's what happenswhen things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.(Laughter)Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology,these four stages of technology's life.I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there,just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens,these four, as a way to kind of tell youwhere each one of those technologies is in its development.They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there --they're just examples of technologiesthat are in each one of these periods.But I think that the implications of them approachingthese crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.Start with gene sequencing.As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part,because it's built on computers -- is falling in priceat a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.It is now possible -- will be possible,and if Craig Venter indeed comes today,he may tell you something about this --to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.You know, our ability to capture the tools of creationis getting closer and closer.What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genesthat we're discovering is rising very quickly.Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.There will come a daywhen you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply,if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price.This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effectof generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere,and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.Today it's less than 50 cents a day.And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity,if you look at the correlation between these two,as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treatgoes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHObelieve that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 --two million in sub-Saharan Africa.And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.Linux is another good example.Now we've switched to critical mass.These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.Interestingly, it's done a crossover before,but not the crossovers that matter.The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.But you can look and see the direction those lines are going,you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.It's not just for the geeks any more.That is, I imagine, what people in Redmondwake up in the middle of the night thinking about.(Laughter)Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 --and I don't think this is a crazy forecast --they'll be two percent of auto sales.Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business,which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.And what's interesting about the hybrids taking offis you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.And once you have electric motors, you can do anything:you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire;you can have replaceable body shapes --it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid,but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere;it's a little hard to use right now.There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year;they already have nearly four million registered users --that's critical mass.And the same thing's happening on the carrier side.You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditionaltelecom standards. This is a tipping point --if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics,and the speed, and the players in the industry.It's going to look a little bit like that.And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.Free is something that comes with digital, becausethe reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP,because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics,because there's so much bandwidth.Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.It's an economic force; it's a technical force.It's a deflationary force, if not handled right.It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.Free is probably the most interesting thing.And here you have just the number of songsthat can be stored on a hard drive.You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there,but it's basically, every song ever made could be storedon 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element,the physical element, of songs off the table.And you've seen the numbers.I mean, you know, the music industry is implodingin front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.They're facing a force that they haven't faced before.And their response is draconian, and not necessarilythe one that's going to get them out of this.And finally, I'll give you one last example of free --perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics --their abundance tends to make things free.This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.And what's interesting is that it was just 1990when it was more than two dollars a minute.India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly,but then there was just so much fiber out there,you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.It's seven cents a minute, in many cases.And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling,to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalizationand one of the most powerful economic toolsthat we're seeing in our world today.The force of India, and then China, and any other countrythat can contact our marketsand will work with our companies -- because the communications are free --is just beginning to be felt.And I think that's probably oneof the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.Thank you.

When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier.You're going to see some other speakers today, I already know,who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff,and, of course, with technology it never is.So it's very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient.I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet,with such an incredible last half a dozen years,that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it.A lot of how we decide, how we're supposed to react to thingsand what we're supposed to expect about the futuredepends on how we bucket thingsand how we categorize them.And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bustthat we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush.It's easy to think of this analogy as very differentfrom some of the other things you might pick.For one thing, both were very real.In 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 millionworth of gold out of California. It was very real.The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans tocommunicate with each other. It's a big deal.Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust.You keep going, and both things are lots of hype.I don't have to remind you of all the hypethat was involved with the Internet -- like GetRich.com.But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. "Gold. Gold. Gold."Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal.Some have 5,000. Many have more.A few bring out 100,000 dollars each.People would get very excited about this when they read these articles."The Eldorado of the United States of America:the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California."And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly.So many people left what they were doing.And what would happen is -- and the Gold Rush went on for years.People on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news,they thought, "Ah, this isn't real."But they keep hearing about people getting rich,and then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it's not real.By about 1852, they're thinking, "Am I the stupidest person on Earthby not rushing to California?" And they start to decide they are.These are community affairs, by the way.Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teamsof 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States,and they would form companies.These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what,if you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing,no matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold.This guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole,he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route.They would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus,and then take another ship north.This guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California.This has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices.These are both very successful -- a physician in one case,a surgeon in the other.Same thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com.(Laughter)In the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship.The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peakbecause the ships would get there and the crews would abandonto go search for gold.So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships.They turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn't sail them anywhere.You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever.And you saw some of the excessesthat the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened.The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers.Half of them deserted to go look for gold.And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first halfbecause they were afraid they wouldn't come back.(Laughter)And one of the soldiers wrote home, and this is the sentence that he put:"The struggle between right and six dollars a monthand wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one."They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate.This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail.They loaded up their mules and their horses.And they didn't plan right.And they didn't know how far they would really have to go,and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff.In fact it was so bad that most of the horses diedbefore they could get where they were going.It got renamed the "Dead Horse Trail."And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time:"Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way,sometimes in bunches under the cliffs,with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above,sometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holesand furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march,often, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive,a fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretchesturned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade.The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhereaccount for the myriads of ravens along the road.The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to,the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone,cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described."And you know, without the smell that would have accompanied that,we had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations.I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it.This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000.(Video): Bride #1: You said you had a large selection of invitations. Clerk: But we do.Bride #2: Then why does she have my invitation?Announcer: What may be a little thing to some ... Bride #3: You are mine, little man.Announcer: Could be a really big deal to you. Husband #1: Is that your wife?Husband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. Announcer: After all, it's your special day.OurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world.Jeff Bezos: It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for.(Laughter)But they spent three and a half million dollarsin the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad,even though, at the time, they only had a million dollars in annual revenue.Now, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge,and I think rather severely.And that is, in a gold rush, when it's over, it's over.Here's this guy: "There are many men in Dawsonat the present time who feel keenly disappointed.They've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip, risked life, health and property,spent months of the most arduous labor a man can performand at length with expectations raised to the highest pitchhave reached the coveted goal only to discoverthe fact that there is nothing here for them."And that was, of course, the very common story.Because when you take out that last piece of gold --and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush --the entire American river region, within two years --every stone had been turned. And after that, only big companieswho used more sophisticated mining technologiesstarted to take gold out of there.So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimisticand that analogy is the electric industry.And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.With the electric industry you actually have to --one of them is that they're both sort of thin,horizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.It's not a specific thing.But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.It's an incredible means of coordinating,in a very fine-grained way, information flows.There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus onis sort of the golden age of appliances.The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb.So the light bulb is what wired the world.And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world.They were really thinking about --they weren't putting electricity into the home;they were putting lighting into the home.And, but it really -- it got the electricity. It took a long time.This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out.All the streets had to be torn up.This is work going on down in lower Manhattanwhere they built some of the first electric power generating stations.And they're tearing up all the streets.The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric,which became General Electric,paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.But that is not the -- and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web.Because, remember, the Web got to standon top of all this heavy infrastructurethat had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure --I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994,when it was growing 2,300 percent a year.How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994when people weren't really investing in the Web?Well, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down.So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure,and then home appliances started coming into being.And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan --this was the 1890 electric fan.And the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted --it depends how you want to measure it --but it's anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time.It starts about 1890. And the electric fan was a big success.The electric iron, also very big.By the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit.(Laughter)There's asbestos under that handle there.This is the first vacuum cleaner, the 1905 Skinner Vacuum,from the Hoover Company. And this one weighed 92 poundsand took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car.So it wasn't a big seller.This was truly, truly an early-adopter product --(Laughter)the 1905 Skinner Vacuum.But three years later, by 1908, it weighed 40 pounds.Now, not all these things were highly successful.(Laughter)This is the electric tie press, which never really did catch on.People, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties.These never really caught on either:the electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller.This came in, like, six different colors.(Laughter)I don't know why. But I thought, you know,sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention;maybe it's time to give this one another shot.So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this.We'd need the right partner. And I thought that really --(Laughter)I thought that would really work, to give that another shot.Now, the toaster was hugebecause they used to make toast on open fires,and it took a lot of time and attention.I want to point out one thing. This is -- you guys know what this is.They hadn't invented the electric socket yet.So this was -- remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity.They wired them for lighting. So your -- your appliances would plug in.They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top.And you'd plug it in there.In fact, if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World,you've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture.All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulbif you wanted to plug in an appliance.The next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine.Now, this was an object of much envy and lust.Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.On the left-hand side, this was the soapy water.And there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning.And it would clean your clothes.This is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here,put them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric wringer.And this was a big deal.You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.And you'd run a long cord into the housewhere you could screw it into your light socket.(Laughter)And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation,because they hadn't invented the off switch.That was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances --because it didn't make any sense.I mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket.So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.That's what you did. You didn't turn it off.And as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either,so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device.And there are --when you research this, there are gruesome descriptionsof people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices.And they couldn't yank the cord outbecause it was screwed into a light socket inside the house.(Laughter)And there was no off switch, so it wasn't very good.And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestorsto be plugging things into a light socket like this.But, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors,I thought I'd show you: this is my conference room.This is a total kludge, if you ask me.First of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket --(Laughter)and so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in.(Laughter)This is supposed -- don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one.This is what it looks like under my desk.I took this picture just two days ago.So we really haven't progressed that much since 1908.(Laughter)It's a total, total mess.And, you know, we think it's getting better,but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself?(Laughter)I challenge you to try. It's very hard.I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science --this process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter)And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house.Try to get DSL installed in your house.The engineers who do it everyday can't do it.They have to -- typically, they come three times.And one friend of mine was telling me a story:not only did they get there and have to wait,but then the engineers, when they finally did get there,for the third time, they had to call somebody.And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphonebecause then they had to wait on hold for an hourto talk to somebody to give them an access codeafter they got there.So we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves.By the way, DSL is a kludge.I mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designedfor the purpose it's being put to --you know it's the whole thing --we're very, very primitive. And that's kind of the point.Because, you know, resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush,then you'd be pretty depressed right nowbecause the last nugget of gold would be gone.But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget.Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.And if you believe that, then you believe that where we are --this is what I think -- I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge --and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web --but there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff --we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet.That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it,but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are.We're in 1908.And if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996:"All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble."1998: "Amazon.toast." In 1999: "Amazon.bomb."My mom hates this picture.(Laughter)She -- but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very,very beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine,then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are.And I do think there's more innovation ahead of usthan there is behind us.And in 1917, Sears -- I want to get this exactly right.This was the advertisement that they ran in 1917.It says: "Use your electricity for more than light."And I think that's where we are.We're very, very early. Thank you very much.

In 1962, with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring,"I think for people like me in the world of the making of things,the canary in the mine wasn't singing.And so the question that we might not have birdsbecame kind of fundamental to those of us wandering aroundlooking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared.And the question was, were the birds singing?Now, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear.But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be.What is a bird?Well, in my world, this is a rubber duck.It comes in California with a warning --"This product contains chemicals known by the State of Californiato cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."This is a bird.What kind of culture would produce a product of this kindand then label it and sell it to children?I think we have a design problem.Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gavecalled "The Monticello Dialogues" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note --"We realize that design is a signal of intention,but it also has to occur within a world,and we have to understand that world in order toimbue our designs with inherent intelligence,and so as we look back at the basic state of affairsin which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial conditionto understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet,and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there,because the news is the news of abundance,and not the news of limits,and I think as our culture tortures itself nowwith tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear,we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent,driven by the sun, and start to imaginewhat that would be like to share."That was a nice thing to get.That was one sentence.Henry James would be proud.This is -- I put it down at the bottom,but that was extemporaneous, obviously.The fundamental issue is that, for me,design is the first signal of human intentions.So what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be --if we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world --well, what would our intention be as a speciesnow that we're the dominant species?And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate,because really, dominion is implicit in stewardship --because how could you dominate something you had killed?And stewardship's implicit in dominion,because you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it.So the question is, what is the first question for designers?Now, as guardians -- let's say the state, for example,which reserves the right to kill, the right to be duplicitous and so on --the question we're asking the guardian at this point isare we meant, how are we meant,to secure local societies, create world peaceand save the environment?But I don't know that that's the common debate.Commerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick,essentially creative, highly effective and efficient,and fundamentally honest, because we can't exchangevalue for very long if we don't trust each other.So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work,but the question we bring to it is,how do we love all the children of all species for all time?And so we start our designs with that question.Because what we realize today is that modern cultureappears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy.If we come here and say, "Well, I didn't intendto cause global warming on the way here,"and we say, "That's not part of my plan,"then we realize it's part of our de facto plan.Because it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan.And I was at the White House for President Bush,meeting with every federal department and agency,and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan.If the end game is global warming, they're doing great.If the end game is mercury toxification of our childrendownwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act,then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as,"Brain death for all children. No child left behind."(Applause)So, the question is, how many federal officialsare ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families?So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful,then you're just moving chess pieces around,if you don't know you're taking the king.So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change,which requires humility. And in my business as an architect,it's unfortunate the word "humility" and the word "architect"have not appeared in the same paragraph since "The Fountainhead."So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility,reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 yearsto put wheels on our luggage.So, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame.There is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game.And so we call it "cradle to cradle,"and our goal is very simple.This is what I presented to the White House.Our goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world,with clean air, clean water, soil and power --economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period.(Applause)What don't you like about this?Which part of this don't you like?So we realized we want full diversity,even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle saidwhen asked what it was like to be President of France.He said, "What do you think it's like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese?"But at the same time, we realize that our products are not safe and healthy.So we've designed productsand we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million.This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutritioninstead of Alzheimer's later in life.We can ask ourselves, what is justice,and is justice blind, or is justice blindness?And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black?Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations.Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes.Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe?Clean soil is a critical problem -- the nitrification, the dead zonesin the Gulf of Mexico.A fundamental issue that's not being addressed.We've seen the first form of solar energythat's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of windhere in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving.And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC,they asked him, "When will we see the end of the age of oil?"I don't know if you remember his answer, but it was,"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones."We see that companies acting ethically in this worldare outperforming those that don't.We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect.This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles, sent to China.This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous,release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment,which is from copper.On the other hand, we see great signs of hope.Here's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured outhow to do mass-produced health.He has given eyesight to two million people for free.We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel againbecause of the contaminants of the coatings --bismuth, antimony, copper and so on.They become building steel.On the other hand, we're working with Berkshire Hathaway,Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet,the largest carpet company in the world.We've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable,down to the parts per million.The upper is Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam,the bottom, a polyolephine -- infinitely recyclable thermoplastic.Now if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability.The building on my right, which is our corporate campus for The Gapwith an ancient meadow, is an asset -- its nesting grounds.Here's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong,with six million people in 40 square miles.During the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day.And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have beenfarming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries.You can't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centurieswithout understanding nutrient flow.My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington,among the first growth and big growth.My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics,so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off.I went to Yale for graduate school,studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier,affectionately known in our business as Brutalism.If we look at the world of architecture,we see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin,the question might be, "Well, where's the sun?"And this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston,and the windows are all closed. And with most productsappearing not to have been designed for indoor use,this is actually a vertical gas chamber.When I went to Yale, we had the first energy crisis,and I was designing the first solar-heated house in Irelandas a student, which I then built --which would give you a sense of my ambition.And Richard Meier, who was one of my teachers,kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism,and he would say, "Bill, you've got to understand- --solar energy has nothing to do with architecture."I guess he didn't read Vitruvius.In 1984, we did the first so-called "green office" in Americafor Environmental Defense.We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials.They said, "They're proprietary, they're legal, go away."The only indoor quality work done in this country at that timewas sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,and it was to prove there was no dangerfrom secondhand smoke in the workplace.So, all of a sudden, here I am, graduating from high school in 1969,and this happens, and we realize that "away" went away.Remember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away?And yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example --you see that little blue thing above Hawaii?That's the Pacific Gyre.It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists,and they found six times as much plastic as plankton.When asked, they said, "It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush."Perhaps that's away.So we're looking for the design rules of this --this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world, Irian Jaya,259 species of tree, and we described thisin the book, "Cradle to Cradle."The book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree.That's the name of the first chapter -- "This Book is Not a Tree."Because in poetics, as Margaret Atwood pointed out,"we write our history on the skin of fishwith the blood of bears."And with so much polymer, what we really needis technical nutrition, and to use somethingas elegant as a tree -- imagine this design assignment:Design something that makes oxygen, sequesters carbon,fixes nitrogen, distills water, accrues solar energy as fuel,makes complex sugars and food, creates microclimates,changes colors with the seasons and self-replicates.Well, why don't we knock that down and write on it?(Laughter)So, we're looking at the same criteriaas most people -- you know, can I afford it?Does it work? Do I like it?We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville,where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson.We're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.Now if we look at the word "competition,"I'm sure most of you've used it.You know, most people don't realize it comes fromthe Latin competere, which means strive together.It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other.They get fit together, and then they compete.The Williams sisters compete -- one wins Wimbledon.So we've been looking at the idea of competitionas a way of cooperating in order to get fit together.And the Chinese government has now --I work with the Chinese government now --has taken this up.We're also looking at survival of the fittest,not in just competition terms in our modern contextof destroy the other or beat them to the ground,but really to fit together and build nichesand have growth that is good.Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good,because, in our lexicon, asphalt is two words: assigning blame.But if we look at asphalt as our growth,then we realize that all we're doing is destroyingthe planetary's fundamental underlying operating system.So when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective,we see energy as physics, chemistry as mass,and all of a sudden, you get this biology.And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem,but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put throughall these toxic materials that we disgorge,we will never be able to recover that.And as Francis Crick pointed out, nine yearsafter discovering DNA with Mr. Watson,that life itself has to have growth as a precondition --it has to have free energy, sunlightand it needs to be an open system of chemicals.So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing,and we want growth, we want free energy from sunlightand we want an open metabolism for chemicals.Then, the question becomes not growth or no growth,but what do you want to grow?So instead of just growing destruction,we want to grow the things that we might enjoy,and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese.So therefore, we have these two metabolisms,and I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart,and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms.The biological one I'm sure you understand,but also the technical one, where we take materialsand put them into closed cycles.We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition.Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition.Biological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans,which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton,the world would run out of cork and dry up.So we need materials in closed cycles,but we need to analyze them down to the parts per millionfor cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects,disruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence,heavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making themand their production and so on.Our first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicalsin the textile industry.Using those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.]We were left with 38 chemicals.We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicalsin human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks.So designers all over the world can analyze their productsdown to the parts per million for human and ecological health.(Applause)We've developed a protocol so that companies can sendthese same messages all the way through their supply chains,because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars-- and say, "Where does your stuff come from?" They say, "Suppliers.""And where does it go?""Customers."So we need some help there.So the biological nutrients, the first fabrics --the water coming out was clean enough to drink.Technical nutrients -- this is for Shaw Carpet, infinitely reusable carpet.Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet.Biotechnical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor,a cradle to cradle car -- concept car.Shoes for Nike, where the uppers are polyesters, infinitely recyclable,the bottoms are biodegradable soles.Wear your old shoes in, your new shoes out.There is no finish line.The idea here of the car is that some of the materialsgo back to the industry forever, some of the materials go back to soil --it's all solar-powered.Here's a building at Oberlin College we designedthat makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water.Here's a building for The Gap, where the ancient grassesof San Bruno, California, are on the roof.And this is our project for Ford Motor Company.It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn.This is obviously a color photograph.These are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford.We saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one,which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurusat a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars.Here it is. It's the world's largest green roof, 10 and a half acres.This is the roof, saving money,and this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer.They showed up in five days.And we now have 350-pound auto workerslearning bird songs on the Internet.We're developing now protocols for cities --that's the home of technical nutrients.The country -- the home of biological. And putting them together.And so I will finish by showing you a new citywe're designing for the Chinese government.We're doing 12 cities for China right now,based on cradle to cradle as templates.Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housingfor 400 million people in 12 years.We did a mass energy balance -- if they use brick,they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal.They'll have cities with no energy and no food.We signed a Memorandum of Understanding --here's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter --for China to adopt cradle to cradle.Because if they toxify themselves, being the lowest-cost producer,send it to the lowest-cost distribution -- Wal-Mart --and then we send them all our money, what we'll discover is thatwe have what, effectively, when I was a student,was called mutually assured destruction.Now we do it by molecule. These are our cities.We're building a new city next to this city; look at that landscape.This is the site.We don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built,so they brought us in to intercede.This is their plan.It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape.And they brought us in and said, "What would you do?"This is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph.So this is the existing site, so this is what it looks like now,and here's our proposal.(Applause)So the way we approached thisis we studied the hydrology very carefully.We studied the biota, the ancient biota,the current farming and the protocols.We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the citywill have fresh air, fresh water and direct sunlightin every single apartment at some point during the day.We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure.We lay out the building areas.We start to integrate commercial and mixed useso the people all have centers and places to be.The transportation is all very simple,everybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility.We have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive.The waste systems all connect.If you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants,which are sold as assets, not liabilities.Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas?The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations.And then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the cityto power the fuel for the cooking for the city.So this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants.And then the compost is all taken backto the roofs of the city, where we've got farming,because what we've done is lifted up the city,the landscape, into the air to -- to restore the native landscapeon the roofs of the buildings.The solar power of all the factory centersand all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city.And this is the concept for the top of the city.We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs.The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next.We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors.And so this is the existing city, and this is the new city.(Applause)

I'm supposed to scare you, because it's about fear, right?And you should be really afraid,but not for the reasons why you think you should be.You should be really afraid that --if we stick up the first slide on this thing -- there we go -- that you're missing out.Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq andthinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market,you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on.And this is what this adventure's really about.This is crystallized DNA.Every life form on this planet -- every insect, every bacteria, every plant,every animal, every human, every politician -- (Laughter)is coded in that stuff.And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA, it looks like that.And we're just beginning to understand this stuff.And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on.It's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on.If you think that the mapping of America's made a difference,or landing on the moon, or this other stuff,it's the map of ourselves and the map of every plantand every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference.And it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution.(Laughter)It turns out that what this stuff is --and Richard Dawkins has written about this --is, this is really a river out of Eden.So, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cellsis really a history of where you've been for the past billion years.And we could start dating things,and we could start changing medicine and archeology.It turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago,white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way.White Europeans were subject to the plague.And when they were subject to the plague, most people didn't survive,but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor.And that mutation was passed on to their kidsbecause they're the ones that survived,so there was a great deal of population pressure.In Africa, because you didn't have these cities,you didn't have that CCR5 population pressure mutation.We can date it to 700 years ago.That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is,and not as fast across Europe.And we're beginning to find these little things for malaria,for sickle cell, for cancers.And in the measure that we map ourselves,this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on.And this Friday, I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine,and I want you to toast these two people.Because this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA,and that is almost as important a dateas the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves,but anyway, we'll get to that.I thought we'd talk about the new zoo.So, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does,but some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of niftybecause this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet.If you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful,it turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there.And we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there,which is part of the reasonwhy this whole species-mapping project is so important.Because we're just beginning to learnwhere we came from and what we are.And we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia.And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much,except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters,which is what makes you you,as far as gene code inside each of your cells,and this little amoeba which, you know,sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions,turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.So, this little thingamajig has a genomethat's 200 times the size of yours.And if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms,it may not turn out to be chips.It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba.And, again, we're learning from life and how life works.This funky little thing: people didn't used to thinkthat it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactorsbecause it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there.And then finally somebody picked up a microscopeand looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores.And sitting next to that water in the coreswas this little Deinococcus radiodurans, doing a backstroke,having its chromosomes blown apart every day,six, seven times, restitching them,living in about 200 times the radiation that would kill you.And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverseand how important and how interesting this journey into life is,and how many different life forms there are,and how there can be different life forms living invery different places, maybe even outside of this planet.Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this,that brings up a whole series of interesting questions.This little thingamajig: we didn't know this thingamajig existed.We should have known that this existedbecause this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye.So, this thing is 0.75 millimeters.It lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia.And what you're looking at with this namibiensisis the biggest bacteria we've ever seen.So, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence.Again, we didn't know this thing was there three years ago.We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo.This is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma.The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron,lives inside the equivalent of battery acid,and excretes sulfuric acid.So, when you think of odd life forms,when you think of what it takes to live,it turns out this is a very efficient life form,and they call it an archaea. Archaea means "the ancient ones."And the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came upwhen this planet was coveredby things like sulfuric acid in batteries,and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core.So, it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphinsthat you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey.Your fear should be that you are not,that you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal.I mean, George Bush -- he's going to be gone, alright? Life isn't.Whether the humans survive or don't survive,these things are going to be living on this planet or other planets.And it's just beginning to understand this code of DNAthat's really the most exciting intellectual adventurethat we've ever been on.And you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gaur.Conservation group gets together,tries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct.They can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing isthey take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gaur's mouth, code,take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg,reprogram cow's egg -- different gene code.When you do that, the cow gives birth to a gaur.We are now experimenting with bongos, pandas, elands, Sumatran tigers,and the Australians -- bless their hearts --are playing with these things.Now, the last of these things died in September 1936.These are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo.But it turns out that as we learn more about gene codeand how to reprogram species,we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.And when we learn how to close the gene gaps,then we can put a full string of DNA together.And if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg,we may give birth to an animalthat hasn't walked the earth since 1936.And then you can start going back further,and you can start thinking about dodos,and you can think about other species.And in other places, like Maryland, they're trying to figure outwhat the primordial ancestor is.Because each of us contains our entire gene codeof where we've been for the past billion years,because we've evolved from that stuff,you can take that tree of life and collapse it back,and in the measure that you learn to reprogram,maybe we'll give birth to somethingthat is very close to the first primordial ooze.And it's all coming out of things that look like this.These are companies that didn't exist five years ago.Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields.Some are public. Some are private.It takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time.Takes about 3 million dollars the second time.We will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years.That means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code.And it will be really boring. It will read like this.(Laughter)The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life.And Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit.Because if you happen to find this one inside your body,you're in big trouble, because that's the source code for Ebola.That's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans.But plants work the same way and insects work the same way,and this apple works the same way.This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk.Because this thing codes ones and zeros,and this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there,absorbing energy on a tree, and one fine dayit has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right?(Laughter)And when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is,it executes the first line of code, which reads just like that,AATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root.Next line of code: make a stem.Next line of code, TACGGGG: make a flower that's white,that blooms in the spring, that smells like this.In the measure that you have the codeand the measure that you read it --and, by the way, the first plant was read two years ago;the first human was read two years ago;the first insect was read two years ago.The first thing that we ever read was in 1995:a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae.In the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know,you can change the source code, and you can reprogram life formsso that this little thingy becomes a vaccine,or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials,which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyesterthat feels like silk in corn.This changes all rules. This is life, but we're reprogramming it.This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes.And what you can do now is,you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is,and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here,and what those genes code for, and what animals they code against,and then you can tie it to the literature.And in the measure that you can do that, you can go home today,and get on the Internet, and accessthe world's biggest public library, which is a library of life.And you can do some pretty strange thingsbecause in the same way as you can reprogram this apple,if you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School,he's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings.Why would Cliff be doing that? He doesn't have a restaurant.(Laughter)The reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wingsis because when you used to play with lizards as a little child,and you picked up the lizard, sometimes the tail fell off, but it regrew.Not so in human beings:you cut off an arm, you cut off a leg -- it doesn't regrow.But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code,each cell can be reprogrammed, if we don't stop stem cell researchand if we don't stop genomic research,to express different body functions.And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings,and what the program is for those cells to differentiate,one of the things we're going to be able to dois to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer,and one of the things we're going to learn how to dois how to reprogram cells like stem cellsin such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas.And you are likely to be wandering around -- and your children --on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time,in some places in the world where they don't stop the research.How's this stuff work? If each of you differsfrom the person next to you by one in a thousand, but only three percent codes,which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent,very small differences in expression and punctuationcan make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence.(Laughter)Right?That's perfectly clear. So, men read that sentence,and they look at that sentence, and they read this.Okay?Now, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong.This is the way it should be seen.(Laughter)That's what your genes are doing.That's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand.Right? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but...I won't go there.You can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation.You can look at this, right?And they look at the world a little differently.They look at the same world and they say...(Laughter)That's how the same gene code -- that's why you have 30,000 genes,mice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes.Mice and men are the same. Wives know that, but anyway.You can make very small changes in gene codeand get really different outcomes,even with the same string of letters.That's what your genes are doing every day.That's why sometimes a person's genesdon't have to change a lot to get cancer.These little chippies, these things are the size of a credit card.They will test any one of you for 60,000 genetic conditions.That brings up questions of privacy and insurabilityand all kinds of stuff, but it also allows us to start going after diseases,because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this,it turns out that three diseases withcompletely similar clinical syndromesare completely different diseases.Because in ALL leukemia, that set of genes over there over-expresses.In MLL, it's the middle set of genes,and in AML, it's the bottom set of genes.And if one of those particular things is expressing in your body,then you take Gleevec and you're cured.If it is not expressing in your body,if you don't have one of those types --a particular one of those types -- don't take Gleevec.It won't do anything for you.Same thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer.Don't have an HER-2 receptor? Don't take Receptin.Changes the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine.Changes the way medicine works.The greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to collegewas this thing, and it turns out thatthis is not so important any more.The U.S. Library of Congress, in terms of its printed volume of data,contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics companyevery month on a compound basis.Let me say that again: A single genomics companygenerates more data in a month, on a compound basis,than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress.This is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law.So, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 monthsand the power doubles, right?Except that when you lay that side by side with the speedwith which gene data's being deposited in GenBank,Moore's Law is right here: it's the blue line.This is on a log scale, and that's what superexponential growth means.This is going to push computers to have to grow fasterthan they've been growing, because so far,there haven't been applications that have been requiredthat need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does.And here's an interesting map.This is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School.One of the really interesting questions is, if all this data's free,who's using it? This is the greatest public library in the world.Well, it turns out that there's about 27 trillion bitsmoving inside from the United States to the United States;about 4.6 trillion is going over to those European countries;about 5.5's going to Japan; there's almost no communicationbetween Japan, and nobody else is literate in this stuff.It's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war;they're focusing on Bush; they're not interested in life.So, this is what a new map of the world looks like.That is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem.In fact, it's not a genomically literate world.You can break this out by states.And you can watch states rise and fall depending ontheir ability to speak a language of life,and you can watch New York fall off a cliff,and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff,and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence.And you can break it out by counties, because it's specific counties.And if you want to get more specific,it's actually specific zip codes.(Laughter)So, you want to know where life is happening?Well, in Southern California it's happening in 92121. And that's it.And that's the triangle between Salk, Scripps, UCSD,and it's called Torrey Pines Road.That means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful;it means you don't need a lot of people to be successful;and it means you can move most of the wealth of a countryin about three or four carefully picked 747s.Same thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but --oh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous.What's the net effect of this?In an agricultural society, the difference betweenthe richest and the poorest,the most productive and the least productive, was five to one. Why?Because in agriculture, if you had 10 kidsand you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder,you could produce about five times more wealth, on average,than your neighbor.In a knowledge society, that number is now 427 to 1.It really matters if you're literate, not just in reading and writingin English and French and German,but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple.And very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code.So, if there is something you should fear,it's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball.Because it really matters who speaks life.That's why nations rise and fall.And it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s,the most productive nation on earth was Australia, per person.And New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about 1950,and then Switzerland about 1973, and then the U.S. got back on top --beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks.And today, of course, you all know that the most productive nationon earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealthper person per year than America.Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources.Just smart people moving bits. Different rules.Here's differential productivity rates.Here's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent.So, about 3,000 Americans, 6,000 Koreans, 14,000 Brits,790,000 Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing?It's got nothing to do with inflation.It's got nothing to do with privatization.You can take a Harvard-educated Ivy League economist,stick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the countrybecause he doesn't understand how the rules have changed.Oh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians.Well, watch what happens to India.India and China used to be 40 percent of the global economyjust at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.Two billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealthbecause they didn't get this change,because they kept treating their people like serfsinstead of like shareholders of a common project.They didn't keep the people who were educated.They didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs.Silicon Valley did. And that's why they saythat Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs.Not integrated circuits: Indians and Chinese.(Laughter)Here's what's happening in the world.It turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in 1950,when it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world.It turns out there's now about 192.Country after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing --and it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped.In the 1990s, these are sovereign statesthat did not exist before 1990.And this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.We're generating about 3.12 states per year.People are taking control of their own states,sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.And the really interesting thing is,you and your kids are empowered to build great empires,and you don't need a lot to do it.(Music)And, given that the music is over, I was going to talkabout how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth,and how code works.Moderator: Two minutes.(Laughter)Juan Enriquez: No, I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next yearbecause I don't want to take any of Laurie's time.But thank you very much.

As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.This morning, the world's expertsfrom I guess three or four different companies on building seats,I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.I could have told them that.(Laughter)Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today,they will be steering cars by wire,without all that mechanical stuff.(Laughter)That's reassuring.(Applause)They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire,to get rid of all that mechanical stuff.That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.I would love to talk about the technology,and sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes,I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around hereabout what's in here.But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first,it would be that from the time we started building this,the big idea wasn't the technology.It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying itin the iBOT for the disabled community.The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solutionto a fairly big problem in transportation.And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this,I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.You never know what strikes the fancy of whom,but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.What I don't think most people think aboutis the context of how technology is applied.For instance, in that time, 91 percent of Americalived either on farms or in small towns.So, the car --the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal;it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.It was half as long.And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance,in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan,because you can imagine what the roads look likewhen you have a million horses,and a million of them urinating and doing other things,and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm,or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns togetherwith what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.And it is certainly a wonder.And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies,I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry --who's been very supportive of us --that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.But think about where the world is today.50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.That's 3.2 billion people.We've solved all the transportation problemsthat have changed the world to get it to where we are today.500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough;we found a new continent.150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power,that we turned the continent into a country.Over the last hundred years, we started building cars,and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other cityin an extraordinarily efficient way,and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.But during that entire process, more and more people have been born,and more and more people are moving to cities.China alone is going to move four to six hundred million peopleinto cities in the next decade and a half.And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years,have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.And if you just look at how technology has been applied,we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume,large-weight problems of moving things around.Nobody would want to give them up.And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane,or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.The fact is, the last mile is the problem,and half the world now lives in dense cities.And people spend, depending on who they are,between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.I think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you,but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the worldis consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air,and almost all particulate pollution on this planetis produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.And again, I say that not to attack any industry,I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane,and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hourare extraordinarily efficient,both from an engineering point of view,an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.And we all love our cars, and I do.The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks,it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.It's not sustainable.If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles;1.7 million people used cars.If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class,and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred yearsat the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into citiesof the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks --it isn't sustainable environmentally;it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil --and it's not sustainable politically.I mean, what are we fighting over right now?We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile,and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs,but once we made this, we instantly decidedit could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.And every one of those industries, by the way --just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do,it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology,but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems,but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which,right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around,cities that were architected and built for people --now have a footprint that,while we've solved every other transportation problem --and it's like Moore's law.I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon,then on a railroad, then an airplane.Every other form of transportation's been improved.In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.They've gotten bigger; they're spread out.The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city --Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris --the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.The 20 largest cities in the world.So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrianswhat we take for granted as we now go between cities?What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean,environmentally friendly?What if it would make it a little bit more palatableto have access via this, as that last link to mass transit,to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbsand use our cars the way we want,and then have our cities energized again?We thought it would be really neat to do that,and one of the problems we really were worried aboutis: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.I don't look like a motor vehicle.I have the same footprint as a pedestrian;I have the same unique capabilityto deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.I took this down to Ground Zero,and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two,and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter,and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.Or maybe we should be out in the streetin front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.We've been so concerned about that,we went to the Postmaster General of the United States,as the first person we ever showed on the outside,and said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously."He agreed. We went to a number of police departmentsthat want their police officers back in the neighborhoodon the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.(Laughter)So we've been working really, really hard,but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to developas an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.We went out and we found some visionary peoplewith enough money to let us design and build these things,and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.But if I could ask you to do one thing,it's not to think about it as a piece of technology,but just imagine that, although we all understand somehowthat it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine,which can go 60 miles an hour,that can bring you everywhere you want to go,and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile,and it's broken, and it doesn't work.One of the more exciting things that occurred to usabout why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.A few weeks ago, after we launched it,we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back,and he's marveling at the technology,and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by,and skateboarders are zipping by,and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary,a little old lady -- came by me --and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now --and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at meand says, "Can I try that?"And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything?And so I said, "Sure."So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah,then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet,and she turns back around, and she's all smiles.And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says,"Finally, they made something for us."And the camera is looking down at her.I'm thinking, "Wow, that was great --(Laughter)-- please lady, don't say another word."(Laughter)And the camera is down at her,and this guy has to put the microphone in her face,said, "What do you mean by that?"And I figured, "It's all over now,"and she looks up and she says, "Well,"she's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no,she says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades,"she knew them by name;she says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle."Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says,"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things."And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears,were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulatorsand the legislators might not get it --it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the peoplenot to invade the most precious little bit of space left,the sidewalks in these cities.When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk,then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes,and then the other eight feet -- it's --that little piece is all that's there.But she looks up and says this,and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things,and they don't vote, and business people and then young adultsaren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool --so I guess subliminally I was worriedthat it's the older population that's going to worry.So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years,the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys,call AARP, get an appointment right away.We've got to show them this thing.And they took it to Washington; they showed them;and they're going to be involved now,watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities,like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact,help re-energize their downtown.(Applause)The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations,or any of the other think tanks --in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planetwill be in cities.In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.They learned to start with cell phones.They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.They start at the top of the technology food chain.We've got to start building cities and human environmentswhere a 150-pound person can go a couple of milesin a dense, rich, green-space environment,without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.Cars were not meant for parallel parking;they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it:we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.You do it in your sneakers.Not much has changed.If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times --a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes --because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train --we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail --or you're going to keep parking those cars.But if you could put a pin in most cities,and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes,you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car,re-park your car and go somewhere;you can't get to a cab or a subway.We could change the way people allocate their resources,the way this planet uses its energy,make it more fun.And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine;this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.Yes, it could be attached to this,and yes, on a kilogram of propane,you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel,because some of you might be skepticalabout the capability of this to have an impact,where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.We've been working on this,actually, as an alternative energy source,starting way back with Johnson &amp; Johnson, to run an iBOT,because the best batteries you could get --10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead,20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium,40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride,60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium,8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline --which is why nobody drives electric cars.But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency --because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove,if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this,which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world,as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out,can run computers and a light bulb.But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say,you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity,you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour,it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt --25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it.That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinateor clean water in this country that way.Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place,turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.Depending on whose numbers you believe,it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.We need water.And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it,or watching their kids die.We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing,with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat,then using a little bit of the electricity control that process,and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat,it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled waterfrom anything that comes into it to cool it.So if we put this box on here in a few years,could we have a solution to transportation, electricity,and communication, and maybe drinkable waterin a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?I don't know, but we'll try it.I better shut up.(Applause)

alex_steffen_sees_a_sustainable_future
1277147

When I'm starting talks like this,I usually do a whole spiel about sustainabilitybecause a lot of people out there don't know what that is.This is a crowd that does know what it is,so I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right?So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know?Fill in the blanks.So, you know, sustainability, small planet.Right? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun.You know, about a million years ago,a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees,got a little clever, harnessed fire,invented the printing press,made, you know, luggage with wheels on it.And, you know, built the society that we now live in.Unfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt,the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created,it's got some major, major flaws.One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint.It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.How much stuff goes through your life,how much waste is left behind you.And we, at the moment, in our society,have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this.We're using up about five planets.If everybody on the planet lived the way we did,we'd need between five, six, seven,some people even say 10 planets to make it.Clearly we don't have 10 planets.Again, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet,10 planets, one planet. Right?We don't have that. So that's one problem.The second problem is that the planet that we haveis being used in wildly unfair ways. Right?North Americans, such as myself, you know,we're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs,and we're eating all sorts of stuff.And, you know, then you get all the way downto people who live in the Asia-Pacific region, or even more, Africa.And people simply do not have enough to survive.This is producing all sorts of tensions,all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing.And there's more and more people on the way. Right?So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years.It's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people.So to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet.A third of the people on this planet are kids.And those kids are growing up in a completely different waythan their parents did, no matter where they live.They've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity.And they may not want to live exactly like us.They may not want to be Americans, or Brits,or Germans, or South Africans,but they want their own versionof a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic,and more, you know, enjoyable.And all of these things combine to createan enormous amount of torque on the planet.And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque,we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quicklyfacing situations which are simply unthinkable.Everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios.I don't need to go into that.But I will ask the question, what's the alternative?And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable.You know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable;on the other hand we have the unimaginable.We don't know yet how to build a societywhich is environmentally sustainable,which is shareable with everybody on the planet,which promotes stability and democracy and human rights,and which is achievable in the time-frame necessaryto make it through the challenges we face.We don't know how to do this yet.So what's Worldchanging?Well, Worldchanging you might think ofas being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future.You know, what we're out there doing is lookingfor examples of tools, models and ideas,which, if widely adopted, would change the game.A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about thingsthat everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of,but most people haven't.So I thought today I'd do something a little different,and talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know,rather than giving you tried-and-true examples.Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out.Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook.And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick.So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right?So, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city.One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed worldfor changing the impact that we have on the planetis changing the way that we live in cities.We're already an urban planet;that's especially true in the developed world.And people who live in cities in the developed worldtend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff.If we can change the dynamic,by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ...Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there,you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city.And they are doing density, new density,better than probably anybody else on the planet right now.They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars,which is a pretty great thing.So you have density. You also have growth management.You leave aside what is natural to be natural.This is in Portland. That is an actual development.That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity.They've bounded the city with a line.Nature, city. Nothing changes.Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments.You can start doing things like, you know,transit systems that actually work to transport people,in effective and reasonably comfortable manners.You can also start to change what you build.This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London,which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place.We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity,that recycle much of their water,that are much more comfortable than standard buildings,use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less.Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much.But once you also have people livingin close proximity to each other,one of the things you can do is --as information technologies develop --you can start to have smart places.You can start to know where things are.When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them.When you share them, you end up using less.So one great example is car-share clubs,which are really starting to take off in the U.S.,have already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example.If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week,do you really need your own car?Another thing that information technology lets us dois start figuring out how to use less stuffby knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using.So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use,which I think is a pretty cool concept,although I think it ought to work the other way around,that it gets brighter the more you don't use.But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach.We could just re-label things.This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods,and on the other hand, off.How we build things can change as well.This is a bio-morphic building.It takes its inspiration in form from life.Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful,and also much more effective.This is an example of bio-mimicry,which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for.In this case, you have a shell designwhich was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective.There's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable.I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it.We're starting to cover this more and more.There's also neo-biological design,where more and more we're actually using life itselfand the processes of life to become part of our industry.So this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae.So we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking forof how to take the cities most of us live in,and turn them into Bright Green cities.But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in.They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world.And there's a statistic I often like to use,which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days,a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days.I was giving a talk about two months ago,and this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to meand was really flustered, and he said, look,you've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong.It's every seven days.So, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days,and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in.Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly.They don't have existing infrastructure;they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty,and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure outhow to do things in new ways.So what do we need in order to make developing nationmegacities into Bright Green megacities?Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging.And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere.The idea behind leapfrogging is thatif you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situationwhere you don't have the tools and technologies that you need,there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right?That you're much better off, almost universally,looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology.One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right?All throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones,skipping the whole landline stage.If there are landlines in many developing world cities,they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lotand cost enormous amounts of money.So I rather like this picture here.I particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone.So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society.We've heard all about this here this week,so I won't say too much more than that, other than to saywhat is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies.The second thing is tools for collaboration,be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systemswhich encourage collaboration. Right?When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate,you get different kinds of solutions.And those solutions are accessible in a different wayto people who don't have capital. Right?So, you know, we have open source software,we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions.And those things lead to things like this.This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo.This is a pretty remarkable programusing free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines,and basically sort of abandoned buildings --has put together a bunch of community centerswhere people can come in, get high-speed internet access,learn computer programming skills for free.And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo.And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo.I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter)So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion.And one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchangingis the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself,and re-categorizing itself in waysthat have less and less to do with most of us in this room.So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right?You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels.It's doing something new. There's new things happening.There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things.Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie "City of God?"Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it.And it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.You have other radical exampleswhere the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out.These are people who have just been visited bythe Internet bookmobile in Uganda.And who are waving their first books in the air,which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know?So you also have the ability for people to start coming togetherand acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways,in ways that haven't happened before.And as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week,are absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions,is we've got to craft new political realities.And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities,not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan,what have you, but here at home as well.Another world is possible.And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right?We tweak that a lot.We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here.That it's not just that we have to sort of imaginethere being a different, vague possibility out there,but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility.We need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil.How many people knew of Lula before today?OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that.So Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions,but one of the things that he's doing is,he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations thatcompletely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogueinto a whole new way of global collaboration.I would keep your eye on this fellow.Another example of this sort of second superpower thingis the rise of these games that are what we call "serious play."We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere.This is from "A Force More Powerful." It's a little screenshot."A Force More Powerful" is a video game that,while you're playing it, it teaches you how to engagein non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter)Here's another one. This is from a game called "Food Force,"which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp.These things are all contributing in a very dynamic wayto a huge rise in, especially in the developing world,in people's interest in and passion for democracy.We get so little news about the developing worldthat we often forget that there are literallymillions of people out there struggling to change thingsto be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt.And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough.But it's happening all over the place,and these tools are part of what's making it possible.Now when you add all those things together,when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools,you know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get?Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world.You get, for example, green power spread throughout the world.You get -- this is a building in Hyderabad, India.It's the greenest building in the world.You get grassroots solutions, things that workfor people who have no capital or limited access.You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains.You get access to distance medicine.These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAsto access databases that have informationthat they don't have access to at home in a distant manner.You get new tools for people in the developing world.These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there,for whom nightfall means darkness,to have a new means of operating.These are refrigerators that require no electricity;they're pot within a pot design.And you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems.Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheapand available to people in the developing world.Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight.Here's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area,will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable.Here's a way of transporting water.I just love this, you know -- I mean carrying water is such a drag,and somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right?I mean, that's a great design.This is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw.Basically you can suck any water through thisand it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips.So, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this.This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever.This is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout,which pumps water as kids play. You know?Seriously -- give that one a hand, it's pretty great.And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right?We're expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020because of climate change and political instability.How do we help people like that?Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designsthat are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet.Some of those designs include models for acting,such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps.New models for pedagogy for the displaced.And we have new tools.This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere.Does anyone know what this is?Audience: It detects landmines.Alex Steffen: Exactly, this is a landmine-detecting flower.If you are living in one of the placeswhere the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered,you can fling these seeds out into the field.And as they grow up, they will grow up around the mines,their roots will detect the chemicals in them,and where the flowers turn red you don't step.Yeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know?(Applause)I also love it because it seems to methat the example, the tools we use to change the world,ought to be beautiful in themselves.You know, that it's not just enough to survive.We've got to make something better than what we've got.And I think that we will.Just to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells,I think that better things are on the way.I think that, in fact, that "all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning.All that the human mind has accomplishedis but the dream before the awakening."I hope that that turns out to be true.The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will.Thank you very much.(Applause)

Hello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodonifor the typographically hysterical amongst us.One of the threads that seems to have come throughloud and clear in the last couple of daysis this need to reconcile what the Big wants --the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country --and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.And how do you bring those two things together?Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulatelyabout this need to bring consumers, to bring peopleinto the process of creating things.And that's what I want to talk about today.So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big,I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in,and something that we kind of bring to lifethrough what we do at Ideo.I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room --the "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-facethat you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times,what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go,"Duh! You know, look what's really going on."And rather than talk about it in the theory,I think I'm just going to show you an example.We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesotato describe to them what their patient experience was.And I think they were expecting --they'd worked with lots of consultants before --I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chartwith thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other,and all kinds of mappy stuff.Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thingwith WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.The first thing we actually shared with them was this.I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.This is 59 seconds into the film.This is a minute 59.3:19.I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.5:10.5:58.6:20.We showed them the whole cut,and they were all completely, what is this?And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day,all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.And just putting yourself in the position of the patient --this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.He just lay in the hospital bed,and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tilesfor a really long time.That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.Oh, my goodness. So, looking at the situationfrom the point of view of the person out --as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in --was, for these guys, quite a revelation.And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.So they snapped into action.They said, OK, it's not about systemic change.It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.So we started with them prototyping some really little thingsthat we could do to have a huge amount of impact.The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirrorand we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley,so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor,you could actually have a conversation with them.You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror,so it created a tiny human interaction.Very small example of something that they could do.Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action --said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.Not particularly the world's best design solutionfor those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers,but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.Things that they started doing themselves --like changing the floor going into the patient's roomso that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" --was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.So you went from public space to private space.And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love --was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards,then they put them on one wall of the patient's room,and they put this sticker there.So that what you could actually do was go into the roomand write messages to the person who was sick in that room,which was lovely.So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.I thought that was a really, really nice example.So this is not particularly a new idea,kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around youand snapping and turning them into a solution.It's a history of invention based around this.I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning,saw her daughter watching the test card,waiting for programs to come on one morningand from that came Sesame Street.Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to anotherand was wondering why it took these guys so longto get the boxes onto the ship.And he invented the shipping container.George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock --was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs,sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention --saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road,when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.So there's a whole series of just using your eyes,seeing things for the first time, seeing things afreshand using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.Second one, without sounding overly Zen,and this is a quote from the Buddha:"Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things,is often a really interesting place to start."Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision,is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.Again, another medical example here.We were asked by a device producer --we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo --they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technologyfor medical diagnostics.This was a device that a nurse useswhen they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.They'll ask the nurses to input data.And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking awayon this aluminum deviceand it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place --and I'll explain this in a second --it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to thisthat they really weren't recognizing.When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine --which was the procedure that this device's data was about;it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did,was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture --which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.So, the thing that we designed, much less sexybut much more human and practical, was this.So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination,but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesturedictated the design of this product.And I think that's really, really important.So, again, this idea of workarounds.We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot,sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TEDand just watching all of these kind of things happenwhile I've been here.This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life --and the things we kind of do in our environmentthat are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential --is something that we look at a lot.We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it,called "Thoughtless Acts?"It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do,which have huge intention and huge opportunity.Why do we all follow the line in the street?This is a picture in a Japanese subway.People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.We don't know why, but we do.Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?Again, we're sort of using the world around usto create our own design solutions.And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital."This is people designing their own experiences.You can draw from this.We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street,that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.It's there for our use, on some level.So, again, we sort of co-opt our environmentto do all these different things.We co-opt other experiences --we take one item and transfer it to another.And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me,"Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."But, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.So somebody assumesthat because somebody else has done something,that's permission for them to do the same thing.And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.We all talk to one another in this highly visual waywithout realizing what we're doing.Third section is this idea of not knowing,of consciously putting yourself backwards.I talk about unthinking situations all the time.Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind cleanand looking at things afresh.A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA,and he was asked by his bossto help design a storage system for children.This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me,because they're impossible to assemble.But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?The reality is when you actually watch children,children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.Children assume permission in a very different way.Children live on things. They live under things.They live around things,and so their spatial awareness relationship,and their thinking around storage is totally different.So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer --is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he issitting under the table.So, what came out of this?This is the storage system that he designed.So what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.(Laughter)It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.It's a completely empathic solution --apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.(Laughter)But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary,and I think that's one of the things.And putting yourself in the position of the person,and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard againfrom this conference is how do we put ourselvesin other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?And then use that information to fuel solutions?And I think that's what this is very much about.Last section: green armband. We've all got them.It's about this really.I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matterbut small enough to win.Again, that's one of the themesthat I think has come through loud and clear in this conferenceis: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?So, again, we were asked to design a water pumpfor a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.They're now called KickStart.And, again, as designers,we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautifuland spend a lot of time thinking of the form.And that was completely irrelevant.When you put yourself in the position of these people,things like the fact that this has to be able to fold upand fit on a bicycle, become much more relevantthan the form of it. The way it's produced,it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methodsand indigenous materials.So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.So what seems like a very clunky productis, in fact, incredibly useful.It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes --it's turning them into entrepreneurs.These guys are using this very successfully.And for us, it's been greatbecause it's won loads of design awards.So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company,the needs of the individuals in the company,to feel good about a product we were actually designing,and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.There it is, pumping water from 30 feet.So as a final gesture we handed out these braceletsto all of you this morning.We've made a donation on everybody's behalf hereto kick start, no pun intended, their next project.Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.We feel that this is an important gesture.So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.I hope you'll all wear them.So that's it. Thank you.(Applause)



chris_bangle_says_great_cars_are_art
835625

What I want to talk about is, as background,is the idea that cars are art.This is actually quite meaningful to me,because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole --we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it --and cars are thought so much as a productthat it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic sideunder the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that --that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.This is completely different than automobiles.Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose;and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 yearsand have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways;they've also been a real pain in the ass,because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve.We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion --but that's not what interests me in this speech.What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use,but cars are what we are, in many ways.And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles,and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on,and lots of other things, then I think we can look past thatand try and understand why this hook is in many of us --of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it.That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes;cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself:they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it --your anger, whatever. It's an avatar.It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy,the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage,you've got a "Chevy: Like a Rock," right?Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this?That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.Many people think, "Well, it's computers,and it's done by machines and stuff like that."Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a carthat you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.That tension between the need to express, the need to discover,then you put something new into it,and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces;this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft.And that tension, that discovery, that push for something new --and at the same time, that sense of obligationto the regards of craftsmanship --that's as strong in cars as it is in anything.We work in clay, which hasn't changed muchsince Michelangelo started screwing around with it,and there's a very interesting analogy to that too.Real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to "discover the figure within," OK?There we go, the automobile.That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that?Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it?OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here,but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.I want to talk about this.Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensualityyou have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality.And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore,I believe that that "pressure within" that Moore's talking about --at least when it comes to cars --comes right back to this idea of the mean.It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself,that comes in a car, and takes over people like me.And we tell other people, "Do this, do this, do this," until this thing comes alive.We are completely infected. And beauty can be the resultof this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it,and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this,or when somebody works like this.It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.Now, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art.Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.We don't really have a problem talking about love.We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.That's what we're searching for --when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.We're not trying to find vanity and beauty.We're trying to find the beauty in the truth.However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian,instead of this quantum approach.We're dealing with irrationalisms,and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist,and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more liketwo and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better.And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergencein why we're doing what we're doing.We've pretty much accepted the fact, though,that we are the women in the organization at BMW --BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers.And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK,that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female.Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic;it's really a truth.And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars,is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it,with soul. You know how strong this is.Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me,are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say,you know, you could take the word "love" out of a lot of things in our society,put the word "design" in, and it still works,like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?You can understand that. It works in truisms."All is fair in design and war."Certainly we live in a competitive society.I think this one here, there's a pop songthat really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is likeyou know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right?Toothbrush, cool.It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK?(Laughter)This is one substitution that I believeall of us, in design management, are guilty of.And this idea that there is more to love,more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other,it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be.But right now it's in dealing with our own people,our own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story.The idea of people-work is what we work with here,and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision --that means we have to work as one family;we have to understand ourselves that way.There's good times; there's interesting times;and there's some stress times too.You want to do cars, you've got to go outside.You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.We haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside?Well, you've got to stand outside to do this.And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments.All right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery,and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right?And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion,we are completely in love with our own creations.This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.This is sick beyond belief.(Laughter)But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a teamtakes on a new dimension, a new meaning.We have a shared center; we have a shared focus --that car stays at the middle of all our relationships.And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.I heard today about Joseph's death genesthat have to go in and kill cell reproduction.You know, that's what I have to do sometimes.We start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars,down to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car,and I'm in the middle of that killing, basically.Someone's love, someone's baby.This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your teamthat permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.They've got that gene infected in them as well,and they want that to live, more than anything else.Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my teamin a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you,because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships.We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it,that I only had a phone number that connected me to them.So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist,we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineersto find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America.This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name,Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM --we actually stole it from them because we figuredif anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue,in a company like BMW, has a hook -- "Deep Blue," wow, cool name.So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers,and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget,what we thought was a set of deliverables,a timetable, and nothing else.Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.And a group of engineers worked in Germany,and the idea was they would work separatelyon this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.They would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart,come together, and they would produce togethera monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas --but at the same time came together and resolved the problems.Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart,where the customer is, live with them in America. So -- sent the team off,and actually something different happened. They went other places.(Laughter)They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas,and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon,and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls,and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else.And I'm telling myself, "This is going to be a great car,they're doing research that I've never even thought about before."Right? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio,and six or seven apartments,it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.And -- at least they told me it was her house,I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their --some had left their wives behind and families behind,and they literally lived in this housefor the entire six months the project was in America,but the first three months were the most intensive.And one of the young women in the project,she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub --it's quite fascinating.On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK?Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcardsof these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever,saying, "Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good." OK?So my concept of what a design studio was probably --I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.However, the engineers back in Munichhad taken on this kind of Newtonian solution,and they were trying to find how many cup holderscan dance on the head of a pin, and, you know,these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.And one was hoping that these two teams would get together,and this collusion of incredible creativity,under these incredible surroundings,and these incredibly stressed-out engineers,would create some incredible solutions.Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was --these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point,you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far,that they cannot bring this together at all.And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon,which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon?And the idea was after the first three months of this independent researchthey would present it all to Dr. Goschel --who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project --and they would present their results.We would see where we were going,we would see the first indication of what could bethe successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense --I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it,and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either --but somehow all this is going to come together,and I'm going to see some really great product.So we went to Tiburon, after three months,and the team had gotten together the week before,many days ahead of time.The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them,and they put their presentation together.Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.And they hadn't done anything because --kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems,and we were asking them to create a problem.And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say,"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it."And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was,the engineers showed up with nothing.And the engineers told the designers,"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out,we'll walk right out of the project."So I didn't know any of this,and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.There was a whole lot of dialog.We spent four hours being told all about vocabularythat needs to be built between engineers and designers.And here I'm expecting at any moment, "OK, they're going to turn the page,and I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches,I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going."Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soonit was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance,I was seriously being baffled with bullshit.And if you can imagine what this is like,to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working,and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning,and they're doing all this stuff.I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.I screamed at them, I yelled at them, "What the hell are you doing?You're letting me down, you're my designers,you're supposed to be the creative ones,what the hell is going on around here?"It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones,but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people;how could they take BMW's money,how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagonsfull of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted,they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers --and they'd decided not to show me anything,in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start,because they hadn't realized, of course,that they couldn't do problem creating.So we went to lunch --(Laughter)And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.The engineers all sat at one end of the table,the designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet.And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know.That's what you get furious about right?And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know,did she fly out with me or something?I said, "No," and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married,the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.He said, "Love is not selfish," he said,"Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.'It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month,and it's two times less than last month,so that means you don't love me as much.Love is not selfish." And I thought about this, and I thought,"You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love.I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches,and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.This cannot be."So I told them this story. I said, "Guys, I'm thinking about something here,this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guysbased on a premise that is a quantifiable one.Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'"I said "This can't be."Actually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it,because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built upinside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted,and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come.And I think we felt much closer that day,we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there,and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love,I think, truly back into the center of the process.By the way, that team went on to create six different conceptsfor the next model of what would be the proposalfor the next generation after SUVs in America.One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes --you see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that.It was the rendition of our motorcycle,the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, "brute-iful,"as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels.And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you,was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of "Little Prince."There's a lot to be said about trust and love,if you know that those two words are synonymous for design.I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day,and it's stayed that way ever since.And I hope that you too find that there's more to design,and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.Thanks so much.(Applause)

I thought in getting up to my TED wishand how it fits with what they try to do.We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent,but insufficient in three major ways.It is, first of all, profoundly unequal:half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day;a billion people with no access to clean water;two and a half billion no access to sanitation;a billion going to bed hungry every night;one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malariaand the variety of infections associated with dirty water --80 percent of them under five years of age.Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing.In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth,five years of productivity growth in the workplace,but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working familiesdropping below the poverty line is up by four percent.The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us --which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we dofor a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal.It is also unstable.Unstable because of the threats of terror,weapons of mass destruction, the spread of global diseaseand a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago.And perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainablebecause of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction.When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughterand the grandchildren I hope to have,it is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainableinterdependence to integrated communities -- locally, nationally and globally --that share the characteristics of all successful communities:a broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities,a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterpriseand a genuine sense of belonging.All easier said than done.When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago,I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11,I think the thing that troubled the British mostwas that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizenswhose religious and political identities were more important to themthan the people they grew up with, went to school with,worked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with.In other words, they thought their differenceswere more important than their common humanity.It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century.Into this mix, people like us, who are not in public office,have more power to do good than at any time in history,because more than half the world's peoplelive under governments they voted in and can vote out.And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion.Because primarily of the power of the Internet,people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of moneythat can change the world for some public good if they all agree.When the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars.30 percent of our households gave.Half of them gave over the Internet.The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars.And thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations.They, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous powerto affect the lives of our fellow human beings.When I became president in 1993,there were none of these organizations in Russia.There are now a couple of hundred thousand.None in India. There are now at least a half a million active.None in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government,probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons.When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it isand the world that I hope to leave to the next generation,and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my lifethat I could still have an impact on.I wanted to focus on activitiesthat would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change,bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world,but to do it in a way that would either usewhatever particular skills we could put together in our groupto change the way some public good function was performedso that it would sweep across the world more.You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs.And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort,and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight,Ira Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done.He's over there.(Applause)When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean,to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis,generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year.If you bought them in vast bulks,you could get them at a little under 400 dollars.The first country we went to work in, the Bahamas,was paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs.The market was so terribly disorganizedthat they were buying this medicine through two agentswho were gigging them sevenfold.So the very first week we were working,we got the price down to 500 dollars.And all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many livesfor the same amount of money.Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines,one of whom was cited in the film,and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy,because even at 500 dollars, these drugswere being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis.So we worked on improving the productivity of the operationsand the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume,absolutely certain-payment business.I joked that the main contribution we madeto the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturersto change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy.But the price went to 140 dollars from 500.And pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars.Now we can get it for about 100 dollars.Children's medicine was 600 dollars,because nobody could afford to buy any of it.We negotiated it down to 190.Then, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline taxto create a something called UNITAID,got a bunch of other countries to help.That children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year.The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the livesof everybody who needs the medicine to stay aliveare the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and carefor people and deliver this medicine.We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America.We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right dealswith the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloricand other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools.We just reorganized the markets.And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world,somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets.And that is now what we're trying to do,and working with this large cities group to fight climate change,to negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable citieswhich generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases,to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissionsin a way that is good economics.And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden,is a mystery to me.I think it's a bird's nest on the ground.When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscarfor the "Inconvenient Truth" movie, I was thrilled,but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly.For those of you who saw "An Inconvenient Truth,"the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one,which shows here's where greenhouse gases are goingif we don't do anything, here's where they could go.And then there are six different categoriesof things we can do to change the trajectory.We need a movie on those six categories.And all of you need to have it embedded in your brainsand to organize yourselves around it.So we're trying to do that.So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do.Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish.It has been my experience in working in developing countriesthat while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say,well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption --I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption,and feeds corruption.We now have the money, given these low prices, to distributeAIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach.Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work,and in a total of 62 countries,and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them.But the money is there to reach others.The systems are not there to reach the people.So what we have been trying to do,working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places --but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight --is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor areathat can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases,maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issuespoor people are grappling with in the developing world,that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda,and then will be a model that could literallybe implemented in any other poor country in the world.And the test is: one, will it do the job?Will it provide high quality care?And two, will it do it at a pricethat will enable the country to sustain a health care systemwithout foreign donors after five to 10 years?Because the longer I deal with these problems,the more convinced I am that we have to --whether it's economics, health, education, whatever --we have to build systems.And the absence of systems that functionbreak the connection which got you all in this seat tonight.You think about whatever your life has been,however many obstacles you have faced in your life,at critical junctures you always knewthere was a predictable connection between the effort you exertedand the result you achieved.In a world with no systems, with chaos,everything becomes a guerilla struggle,and this predictability is not there.And it becomes almost impossible to save lives,educate kids, develop economies, whatever.The person, in my view,who has done the best job of this in the health care area,of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer,who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group,Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started,but they've also worked in Russia, in Peruand other places around the world.As poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active --and they serve a catchment area far greaterthan the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve --since 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one.And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results.So when we decided to work in Rwandaon trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem,we wanted to build a healthcare network,because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994,and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day.So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help.Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haitiand a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country,number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a countrythat has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years,and number two, we would have something that could then be adaptedto any other poor country anywhere in the world.And so we have set about doing that.Now, we started working together 18 months ago.And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza,which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda,with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people.We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti:he develops and trains paid community health workerswho are able to identify health problems,ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosedand take their medicine regularly,who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation,providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health careif they have problems of the severity that require it.The procedures that make this work have been perfected,as I said, by Paul Farmer and his teamin their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years.Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda.And the results were so good that the Rwandan governmenthas now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country,and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it.I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do.We have about 500 people around the worldworking in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing --just for transportation, room and board.And then we have others working in these other related programs.Our business plan in Rwandawas put together under the leadership of Diana Noble,who is an unusually gifted woman,but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work.She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s.She was CEO of a successful e-venture --she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures --and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life.So she now works full-time on this for very little pay.She and her team of former business people have created a business planthat will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country.And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity workshe used to do when she was making a lot more money for it.When we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of fivehad stunted growth due to malnutrition.23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five.Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent.Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurredbecause of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation --all entirely preventable and treatable.Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses --again, all preventable and treatable.And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis.Within the first 18 months, the following things happened:we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS.That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area.Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treatedstopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment.That's lower than the figure in the United States.Less than three-tenths of one percenthad to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs.400,000 pregnant women were brought into counselingand will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system.That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies.About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000.About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it --in just 18 months, up from zero when we started.43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding programto prevent malnutrition and early deathare now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow.We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there.Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocidethat we have renovated along with four other clinics,complete with solar power generators, good lab technology.We now are treating 325 people a month,despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home.And the most important thing isbecause we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers,we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwandafor between five and six percent of GDP,and that the government could sustain thatwithout depending on foreign aid after five or six years.And for those of you who understand healthcare economicsyou know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDPon health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 --but that's a story for another day.(Laughter)We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwandaand our Foundation folks to scale this system up.We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho.And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique,Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing:to save as many lives as quickly as we can,but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwideand then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world.We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses,health administration and community health workers throughout the country,to set up the information technology, the solar energy,the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure.But over a five- to 10-year period,we will take down the need for outside assistanceand eventually it will be phased out.My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to builda high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda,that can be a model for Africa,and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world.My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated worldwith more partners and fewer terrorists,with more productive citizens and fewer haters,a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in.It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwandawhere we also have a major economic development projectin partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist,where last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs,cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percentand achieved three- to four-hundred percent increasesin crop yields with the farmers.These people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me,helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other.We're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future.We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way.I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric gridto the 35 percent of the people that have no access,but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects,the Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson,in preserving their topsoil.There's a couple of guys from southern farming families --the first thing I did when I went out to this placewas to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirtand see what they'd done with it.We have a chance here to prove that a countrythat almost slaughtered itself out of existencecan practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrowand provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help.I am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end.We could use some more help to do this,but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health systemin Rwanda -- in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income,one that could save hundreds of millions of livesover the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth.It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed.Thank you and God bless you.(Applause)

What I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity,is simply repeat many of the pointsthat the three people before me have already made,but do them --this is called "creative collaboration;"it's actually called "borrowing" --but do it through a particular perspective,and that is to ask about the role of users and consumersin this emerging world ofcollaborative creativitythat Jimmy and others have talked about.Let me just ask you, to start with,this simple question:who invented the mountain bike?Because traditional economic theory would say,well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporationthat had a big R&amp;D labwhere they were thinking up new projects,and it came out of there. It didn't come from there.Another answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone geniusworking in his garage, who,working away on different kinds of bikes, comes upwith a bike out of thin air.It didn't come from there. The mountain bikecame from users, came from young users,particularly a group in Northern California,who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes,which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode,or your big brother, and they're very glamorous.But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode,which sort of had big handlebars like that, and they were too heavy.So, they got the frames from these big bikes,put them together with the gears from the racing bikes,got the brakes from motorcycles,and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients.And for the first, I don't know, three to five years of their life,mountain bikes were known as "clunkers."And they were just made in a community of bikers,mainly in Northern California.And then one of these companies that was importing partsfor the clunkers decided to set up in business,start selling them to other people,and gradually another company emerged out of that, Marin,and it probably was, I don't know,10, maybe even 15, years,before the big bike companiesrealized there was a market.Thirty years later,mountain bike salesand mountain bike equipmentaccount for 65 percent of bike sales in America.That's 58 billion dollars.This is a category entirely created by consumersthat would not have been created by the mainstream bike marketbecause they couldn't see the need,the opportunity;they didn't have the incentive to innovate.The one thing I think I disagree withabout Yochai's presentationis when he said the Internet causesthis distributive capacity for innovation to come alive.It's when the Internet combineswith these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers --who are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate;they've got the tools; they want to --that you get this kind of explosionof creative collaboration.And out of that, you get the need for the kind of thingsthat Jimmy was talking about, which is our new kinds of organization,or a better way to put it:how do we organize ourselves without organizations?That's now possible; you don't need an organization to be organized,to achieve large and complex tasks,like innovating new software programs.So this is a huge challengeto the way we think creativity comes about.The traditional view, still enshrinedin much of the way that we think about creativity-- in organizations, in government --is that creativity is about special people:wear baseball caps the wrong way round,come to conferences like this, in special places,elite universities, R&amp;D labs in the forests, water,maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors,you know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table.Special people, special places, think up special ideas,then you have a pipeline that takes the ideasdown to the waiting consumers, who are passive.They can say "yes" or "no" to the invention.That's the idea of creativity.What's the policy recommendation out of thatif you're in government, or you're running a large company?More special people, more special places.Build creative clusters in cities;create more R&amp;D parks, so on and so forth.Expand the pipeline down to the consumers.Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong.I think it's always been wrong,because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative,and it's probably been largely interactive.But it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrongis that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline.The ideas are coming back from the consumers,and they're often ahead of the producers.Why is that?Well, one issueis that radical innovation,when you've got ideas thataffect a large number of technologies or people,have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them.The payoffs to innovation are greatestwhere the uncertainty is highest.And when you get a radical innovation,it's often very uncertain how it can be applied.The whole history of telephonyis a story of dealing with that uncertainty.The very first landline telephones,the inventors thoughtthat they would be used for people to listen into live performancesfrom West End theaters.When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS,they had no idea what it was for;it was only when that technology got into the handsof teenage usersthat they invented the use.So the more radical the innovation,the more the uncertainty,the more you need innovation in useto work out what a technology is for.All of our patents, our entire approachto patents and invention, is based on the ideathat the inventor knows what the invention is for;we can say what it's for.More and more, the inventors of thingswill not be able to say that in advance.It will be worked out in use,in collaboration with users.We like to think that invention isa sort of moment of creation:there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea.The truth is that most creativityis cumulative and collaborative;like Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.The second reason why users are more and more importantis that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations.If you want to find the big new ideas,it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets,in big organizations.And just look inside large organizationsand you'll see why that is so.So, you're in a big corporation.You're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder.Do you go into your board and say,"Look, I've got a fantastic ideafor an embryonic productin a marginal market,with consumers we've never dealt with before,and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?"No, what you do, is you go in and you say,"I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovationto an existing product we sell through existing channelsto existing users, and I can guaranteeyou get this much return out of it over the next three years."Big corporations have an in-built tendencyto reinforce past success.They've got so much sunk in itthat it's very difficult for them to spotemerging new markets. Emerging new markets, then,are the breeding grounds for passionate users.Best example:who in the music industry,30 years ago, would have said,"Yes, let's invent a musical formwhich is all about dispossessed black menin ghettos expressing their frustrationwith the world through a form of musicthat many people find initially quite difficult to listen to.That sounds like a winner; we'll go with it."(Laughter).So what happens? Rap music is created by the users.They do it on their own tapes, with their own recording equipment;they distribute it themselves.30 years later,rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture --would never have come from the big companies.Had to start -- this is the third point --with these pro-ams.This is the phrase that I've used insome stuff which I've donewith a think tank in London called Demos,where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs --i.e., they do it for the love of it --but they want to do it to very high standards.And across a whole range of fields --from software, astronomy,natural sciences,vast areas of leisure and culturelike kite-surfing, so on and so forth --you find people who want to do things because they love it,but they want to do these things to very high standards.They work at their leisure, if you like.They take their leisure very seriously:they acquire skills; they invest time;they use technology that's getting cheaper -- it's not just the Internet:cameras, design technology,leisure technology, surfboards, so on and so forth.Largely through globalization,a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper.More knowledgeable consumers, more educated,more able to connect with one another,more able to do things together.Consumption, in that sense, is an expressionof their productive potential.Why, we found, people were interested in this,is that at work they don't feel very expressed.They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them,so they pick up these kinds of activities.This has huge organizational implicationsfor very large areas of life.Take astronomy as an example,which Yochai has already mentioned.Twenty years ago, 30 years ago,only big professional astronomerswith very big telescopes could see far into space.And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank,and when I was a kid, it was amazing,because the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails.And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous.Now, sixamateur astronomers, working with the Internet,with Dobsonian digital telescopes --which are pretty much open source --with some light sensorsdeveloped over the last 10 years, the Internet --they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago.So here in astronomy, you have this vast explosionof new productive resources.The users can be producers.What does this mean, then, for ourorganizational landscape?Well, just imagine a world,for the moment, divided into two camps.Over here, you've got the old, traditional corporate model:special people, special places;patent it, push it down the pipelineto largely waiting, passive consumers.Over here, let's imagine we've gotWikipedia, Linux, and beyond -- open source.This is open; this is closed.This is new; this is traditional.Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty,is what Yochai has said already --is there is a great big strugglebetween those two organizational forms.These people over there will do everything they canto stop these kinds of organizations succeeding,because they're threatened by them.And so the debates aboutcopyright, digital rights, so on and so forth --these are all about trying to stifle, in my view,these kinds of organizations.What we're seeing is a complete corruptionof the idea of patents and copyright.Meant to be a way to incentivize invention,meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge,they are increasingly being used by large companiesto create thickets of patentsto prevent innovation taking place.Let me just give you two examples.The first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalistand saying, "I've got a fantastic idea.I've invented this brilliant new programthat is much, much better than Microsoft Outlook."Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venturecompeting with Microsoft, with Microsoft Outlook? No one.That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come --will only come --from an open-source kind of project.So, there is a huge competitive argumentabout sustaining the capacityfor open-source and consumer-driven innovation,because it's one of the greatestcompetitive levers against monopoly.There'll be huge professional arguments as well.Because the professionals, over herein these closed organizations --they might be academics; they might be programmers;they might be doctors; they might be journalists --my former profession --say, "No, no -- you can't trust these people over here."When I started in journalism --Financial Times, 20 years ago --it was very, very excitingto see someone reading the newspaper.And you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tubeto see if they were reading your article.Usually they were reading the share prices,and the bit of the paper with your article onwas on the floor, or something like that,and you know, "For heaven's sake, what are they doing!They're not reading my brilliant article!"And we allowed users, readers,two places where they could contribute to the paper:the letters page, where they could write a letter in,and we would condescend to them, cut it in half,and print it three days later.Or the op-ed page, where if they knew the editor --had been to school with him, slept with his wife --they could write an article for the op-ed page.Those were the two places.Shock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers.That's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write.But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists thinkthat the bloggers want to be journalists;they don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice.They want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation.They want to be part of that flow of information.What's happening there is that the whole domainof creativity is expanding.So, there's going to be a tremendous struggle.But, also, there's going to be tremendous movementfrom the open to the closed.What you'll see, I think, is two things that are critical,and these, I think, are two challengesfor the open movement.The first is:can we really survive on volunteers?If this is so critical,do we not need it funded, organized, supportedin much more structured ways?I think the idea of creating the Red Crossfor information and knowledge is a fantastic idea,but can we really organize that, just on volunteers?What kind of changes do we need in public policyand funding to make that possible?What's the role of the BBC,for instance, in that world?What should be the role of public policy?And finally, what I think you will seeis the intelligent, closed organizationsmoving increasingly in the open direction.So it's not going to be a contest between two camps,but, in between them, you'll find all sorts of interesting placesthat people will occupy.New organizational models coming about,mixing closed and open in tricky ways.It won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux --there'll be all sorts of things in between.And those organizational models, it turns out,are incredibly powerful,and the people who can understand themwill be very, very successful.Let me just give you one final exampleof what that means.I was in Shanghai,in an office blockbuilt on what was a rice paddy five years ago --one of the 2,500 skyscrapersthey've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years.And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan.Timothy Chan set up an Internet businessin 2000.Didn't go into the Internet, kept his money,decided to go into computer games.He runs a company called Shanda,which is the largest computer games company in China.Nine thousand servers all over China,has 250 million subscribers.At any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games.How many people does he employto service that population?500 people.Well, how can he service250 million people from 500 employees?Because basically, he doesn't service them.He gives them a platform;he gives them some rules; he gives them the toolsand then he kind of orchestrates the conversation;he orchestrates the action.But actually, a lot of the contentis created by the users themselves.And it creates a kind of stickinessbetween the community and the companywhich is really, really powerful.The best measure of that: so you go into one of his games,you create a characterthat you develop in the course of the game.If, for some reason, your credit card bounces,or there's some other problem,you lose your character.You've got two options.One option: you can create a new character,right from scratch, but with none of the history of your player.That costs about 100 dollars.Or you can get on a plane, fly to Shanghai,queue up outside Shanda's offices --cost probably 600, 700 dollars --and reclaim your character, get your history back.Every morning, there are 600 people queuingoutside their officesto reclaim these characters. (Laughter)So this is about companies built on communities,that provide communities with tools,resources, platforms in which they can share.He's not open source,but it's very, very powerful.So here is one of the challenges, I think,for people like me, whodo a lot of work with government.If you're a games company,and you've got a million players in your game,you only need one percent of themto be co-developers, contributing ideas,and you've got a development workforceof 10,000 people.Imagine you could take all the childrenin education in Britain, and one percent of themwere co-developers of education.What would that do to the resources availableto the education system?Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHSto, in some sense, be co-producers of health.The reason why --despite all the efforts to cut it down,to constrain it, to hold it back --why these open models will still start emergingwith tremendous force,is that they multiply our productive resources.And one of the reasons they do thatis that they turn users into producers,consumers into designers.Thank you very much.

What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world.I'm not going to talk about "The Skeptical Environmentalist" --probably that's also a good choice.(Laughter)But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world?And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of youto try and get out pen and paperbecause I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that.So get out your pen and paper.Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.I'm just going to list some of them.There are 800 million people starving.There's a billion people without clean drinking water.Two billion people without sanitation.There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS.The lists go on and on.There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on.There are many, many problems out there.In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't.We don't actually solve all problems.And if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves --and that's why it's on the economy session -- is to say,if we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves,which ones should we solve first?And that's the question I'd like to ask you.If we had say, 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spendto do good in this world, where should we spend it?We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world,and I will just briefly read them:climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education,financial instability, governance and corruption,malnutrition and hunger, population migration,sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers.We believe that these in many waysencompass the biggest problems in the world.The obvious question would be to ask,what do you think are the biggest things?Where should we start on solving these problems?But that's a wrong problem to ask.That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January.But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems.Because we can't solve problems.Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die.But we don't have a technology to solve that, right?So the point is not to prioritize problems,but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems.And that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated.To climate change that would be like Kyoto.To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets.To conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on.The point that I would like to ask you to try to do,is just in 30 seconds -- and I know this is in a sensean impossible task -- write down what you thinkis probably some of the top priorities.And also -- and that's, of course, where economics gets evil --to put down what are the things we should not do, first.What should be at the bottom of the list?Please, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor,and just figure out what should be the top prioritiesand the bottom priorities of the solutions that we haveto the world's biggest issues.The amazing part of this process -- and of course, I mean,I would love to -- I only have 18 minutes,I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right?I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process,and that's actually what we did.And I also strongly encourage you,and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards,to think about, how do we actually prioritize?Of course, you have to ask yourself,why on Earth was such a list never done before?And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable.Nobody wants to do this.Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list.But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list.And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the listthan there is number ones, it makes perfect sensenot to want to do such a list.We've had the U.N. for almost 60 years,yet we've never actually made a fundamental listof all the big things that we can do in the world,and said, which of them should we do first?So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing --any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing,if only implicitly -- and that's unlikely to be as goodas if we actually did the prioritization,and went in and talked about it.So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have,for a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices.There are many, many things we can do out there,but we've not had the prices, nor the sizes.We have not had an idea.Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card,but you have no idea what the price is.You know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is.It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars.It could be a family-size pizza;it could be a very individual-size pizza, right?We'd like to know these things.And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do --to try to put prices on these issues.And so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process.We got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area.So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change.What can we do? What will be the costand what will be the benefit of that?Likewise in communicable diseases.Three of the world's top experts saying, what can we do?What would be the price?What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?And so on.Then we had some of the world's top economists,eight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates,meet in Copenhagen in May 2004.We called them the "dream team."The Cambridge University prefects decided to call themthe Real Madrid of economics.That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here.And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.And then you ask, why economists?And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question -- (Laughter) --because that's a very good question.The point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria,you ask a malaria expert.If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist.But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first,you can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do.That is what economists do.They prioritize.They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first,and which one should we do afterwards?So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you.Of course, you can also see it on the website,and we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on.They basically came up with a list where they saidthere were bad projects -- basically, projectswhere if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back.Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects.And of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing.I'm going to go from backwardsso that we end up with the best projects.These were the bad projects.As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.This offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the thingswhere people will say I shouldn't come back, either.And I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious.Why is it it came up?And I'll actually also try to get back to thisbecause it's probably one of the thingsthat we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto --or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad dealis simply because it's very inefficient.It's not saying that global warming is not happening.It's not saying that it's not a big problem.But it's saying that what we can do about itis very little, at a very high cost.What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models,is that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year.That's a substantial amount of money.That's two to three times the global development aidthat we give the Third World every year.Yet it would do very little good.All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.Which is a little good, but not very much good.So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good.And just to give you a sense of reference,the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount,for about 75 billion dollars a year,we could solve all major basic problems in the world.We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcareand education to every single human being on the planet.So we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amounton doing very little good?Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good?And that is really why it becomes a bad project.It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it.But it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority.The fair projects -- notice I'm not going to comment on all these --but communicable diseases, scale of basic health services -- just made it,simply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing.It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly.Again, what it tells us is suddenlywe start thinking about both sides of the equation.If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in.Again, sanitation and water is incredibly important,but it also costs a lot of infrastructure.So I'd like to show you the top four prioritieswhich should be at least the first ones that we deal withwhen we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria.The incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year.It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDPevery year for affected nations.If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years,we could bring that incidence down to half.We could avoid about 500,000 people dying,but perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] peoplegetting infected every year.We would significantly increase their abilityto deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with --of course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming.This third best one was free trade.Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade,and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe,we could basically enliven the global economyto an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year,half of which would accrue to the Third World.Again, the point is to say that we could actually pulltwo to three hundred million people out of poverty,very radically fast, in about two to five years.That would be the third best thing we could do.The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition.Not just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap wayof dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients.Basically, about half of the world's population is lacking iniron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A.If we invest about 12 billion dollars,we could make a severe inroad into that problem.That would be the second best investment that we could do.And the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS.Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years,we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS.Again, what this does and what it focuses on is sayingthere are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS.One is treatment; the other one is prevention.And again, in an ideal world, we would do both.But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well,we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first.And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention.So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot moreby investing in prevention.Basically for the amount of money that we spend,we can do X amount of good in treatment,and 10 times as much good in prevention.So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment,at first rate.What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities.I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say,did you get it right?Or did you get close to what we came up with here?Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again.I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.We should also do climate change,if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.But of course, we don't do all problems.There are many problems out there in the world.And what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems,that we focus on the right ones.The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good.And I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling,one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well.One of things that people forget, is that in 100 years,when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be,people will be much, much richer.Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100will be about as rich as we are today.Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are.And of course, we'll be even richer than that.But the point is to say, when we talk about saving people,or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100,we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi.We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy.And so the real point, of course, is to say,do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little,100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy?Or do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh,who really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply?Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be --a rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100,thinking back on 2005, and saying, "How odd that they cared so muchabout helping me a little bit through climate change,and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfatherand my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more,and who needed the help so much more?"So I think that really does tell us why it iswe need to get our priorities straight.Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem.Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.We have, you know, "The Day After Tomorrow" -- it looks great, right?It's a good film in the sense thatI certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerichto cast Brad Pitt in his next moviedigging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter)It just doesn't make for as much of a movie.So in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensusand the whole discussion of prioritiesas a defense for boring problems.To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good.It's not about making things that have the most media attention,but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.The other objections, I think, that are important to say,is that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice.Of course, we should do all things,in an ideal world -- I would certainly agree.I think we should do all things, but we don't.In 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spendtwice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world.Since then our aid has halved.So it doesn't look like we're actually on the pathof suddenly solving all big problems.Likewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war?You know, we spend 100 billion dollars --why don't we spend that on doing good in the world?I'm all for that.If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.But the point, of course, is still to say,if you get another 100 billion dollars,we still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we?So the real issue here is to get ourselves backand think about what are the right priorities.I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out?You know, when you ask the world's best economists,you inevitably end up asking old, white American men.And they're not necessarily, you know,great ways of looking at the entire world.So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the worldto come and solve the same problem.The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university,and they spoke English.The majority of them were, first, from developing countries.They had all the same material but they could go vastlyoutside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did,to come up with their own lists.And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar --with malnutrition and diseases at the topand climate change at the bottom.We've done this many other times.There's been many other seminars and university students, and different things.They all come out with very much the same list.And that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believethat there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities,and saying, what is the important thing in the world?Of course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything.But if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process.We did it in 2004,and we hope to assemble many more people,getting much better information for 2008, 2012.Map out the right path for the world --but also to start thinking about political triage.To start thinking about saying, "Let's donot the things where we can do very little at a very high cost,not the things that we don't know how to do,but let's do the great things where we can do an enormousamount of good, at very low cost, right now."At the end of the day, you can disagreewith the discussion of how we actually prioritize these,but we have to be honest and frank about saying,if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.If we worry too much about some things,we end by not worrying about other things.So I hope this will help us make better priorities,and think about how we better work for the world.Thank you.

Let me show you some imagesof what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow.So, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi.This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Parkin Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days.This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favelain Rio de Janeiro.And this is Sultanbelyi,which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul.They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow,the new urban world.Now, why do I say that?To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here,his name is Julius.And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera.So, I had been there almost three months,and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areasand Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyedand at certain points we were walking around,he grabbed my hand for support,which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing.They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly.And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi,and he's one of many.So, close to 200,000 people a daymigrate from the rural to the urban areas.That's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticianswho talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week,but almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist,and we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week,close to 70 million people a year.And if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute.So, that'll be -- in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here,between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities.And here are the statistics.Today -- a billion squatters,one in six people on the planet.2030 -- two billion squatters,one in four people on the planet.And the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters,better than one in three people on earth.So, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them.And I was thinking this morning of the good life,and before I show you the rest of my presentation,I'm going to violate TED rules here,and I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can.Because I think it says something about reversing our perceptionof what we think the good life is.So -- "The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.It was a 10 by 10 cell.Armstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men.Armstrong and his friends had no water --they bought it from a nearby tap owner --no toilet -- the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine --and no sewers or sanitation.They did have electricity,but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires,and could only power one feeble bulb.This was Southland, a small shanty communityon the western side of Nairobi, Kenya.But it could've been anywhere in the city,because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal hutswith no services, no toilets, no rights."Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation:they paid 1,500 shillings in rent, about 20 bucks a month,a relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown,and they could not afford to be late with the money.'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmenand bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said.'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu,who was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoctionthat is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation.They called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a personwho has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz.Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes;the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof;and we perspired as we ate."After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie,put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.Outside a mound of garbage formed the borderbetween Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata.It was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide.And it was set in a wider watery ooze.As we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash.They couldn't have been more than five or six years old.They were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the mucksending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.I thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong.Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts,squatted, and defecated.The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs.When 20 families -- 100 people or so -- share a single latrine,a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing.But it stood in jarring contrastto something Armstrong had said as we were eating --that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood."For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions.Instead, the human spirit radiated outfrom the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer somethingno legal neighborhood could: freedom.'This place is very addictive,' he had said.'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you.Nobody is controlling what you do.Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.'He meant back beyond that mountain of trash,back in the legal city, of legal buildings,with legal leases and legal rights.'Once you have stayed here,' he said,'you can stay for the rest of your life.'"So, he has hope, and this is where these communities start.This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera,little more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap.This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India.This is home improvement:putting plastic tarps on your roof.This is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right?We're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs,and plaster over the brick, some color,and this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better.He's got a fence; he scavenged a door;he's got new tile on the roof.And then you get Rocinhaand you can see that it's getting even better.The buildings here are multi-story.They develop -- you can see on the far rightone where it seems to just stack on top of each other,room, after room, after room.And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories,and they sell their loggia or roof rights,and someone else builds on top of their building,and then that person sells the roof rights,and someone else builds on top of their building.All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.And then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even builtto a higher level of design.The crud in the front is mattress stuffing,and you see that all over Turkey.People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs.But the green building, on behind,you can see that the top floor is not occupied,so people are building with the possibility of expansion.And it's built to a pretty high standard of design.And then you finally get squatter homes like this,which is built on the suburban model.Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.That's also in Istanbul, Turkey.They're quite vital places, these communities.This is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea,and there's a bus route that runs through it,lots of people out on the street.These communities in these cities are actually more vitalthan the illegal communities.They have more things going on in them.This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a "beco" --these are how you get around the community.It's on very steep ground.They're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio,and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions.So, that's just a rock in the hillside.And these becos are normally very crowded,and people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them,all sorts of things.Beer is all carried in on your shoulders.Beer is a very important thing in Brazil.This is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks,so close to the train tracks that the merchantssometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way.This is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market,lots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy.Those green things in the foreground are mangoes.This is a shopping street in Kibera,and you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic,two beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more.It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built.This here, on the right-hand side,is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning --it's a hotel.And what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place.So, that's a restaurant.People steal electrical power -- this is Rio.People tap in and they have thieves who are called "grillos" or "crickets,"and they steal the electrical powerand wire the neighborhood.People burn trash to get rid of the garbage,and they dig their own sewer channels.Talk about more plastic bags than plankton.And sometimes they have natural trash-disposal.And when they have more money they cement their streets,and they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that.This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place,and that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do:they steal electricity; they install a pumpand they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses.So, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village,to the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi?I say there are two things.One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted.That does not necessarily mean property rights,and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question,because property rights create a lot of complications.They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debtand have to pay back the debt,and sometimes have to sell their propertyin order to pay back the debt.There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rightssometimes don't work in these cases,but they do need security of tenure.And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things.That can mean community organizing from below,but it can also mean possibilities from above.And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable.Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters.One is that -- it's called "gecekondu" in Turkish,which means "built overnight," and if you build your house overnightin Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law,if they don't catch you during the night.And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 peoplein the community, you can petition the governmentto be recognized as a legal sub-municipality.And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes,provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.So, these are the civic leaders of the future.The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa.She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai.That's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her familyon the tent along the same highway median.They're very outspoken. They're very active.They can be community leaders.This woman is Nine, which means "grandma" in Turkish.And there were three old ladies who lived in --that's her self-built house behind her -- and they've lived there for 30 or 40 years,and they are the backbone of the community there.This is Richard Muthama Peter,and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood,and the people in the neighborhood,and is a great resource in the community.And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio,the fruit merchant with his two kids here,and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know.The future of these communities is in the peopleand in our ability to work with those people.So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book,from what Armstrong said, and from all these people,is that these are neighborhoods.The issue is not urban poverty.The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing.The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods --this is a legitimate form of urban development --and that cities have to engage these residents,because they are building the cities of the future.Thank you very much.

cut down to three minutes.seven years ago.and she came from a really poor family.and she asked me a simple little question.She said, "What leads to success?"And I felt really badly,because I couldn't give her a good answer.So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.and pass it on to kids?and makes TEDsters tick.And the first thing is passion.And the interesting thing is:Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!(Laughter)(Laughter)Good!(Applause)and get damn good at it."And it's focus.Norman Jewison said to me,And push!David Gallo says, "Push yourself.I didn't think I'd make it."Now it's not always easy to push yourself,and that's why they invented mothers.(Laughter)(Applause)Frank Gehry said to me,"My mother pushed me."(Laughter)Serve!A lot of kids want to be millionaires.The first thing I say is:"OK, well you can't serve yourself;Ideas!TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea:I'd say it was a pretty good idea.it's just doing some very simple things.And I give lots of evidence.Persist!Joe Kraus says,(Laughter)So, the answer to this question is simple:Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.(Laughter)(Applause)



ray_kurzweil_on_how_technology_will_transform_us

Well, it's great to be here.We've heard a lot about the promise of technology, and the peril.I've been quite interested in both.If we could convert 0.03 percentof the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy,we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030.We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy,expensive and very inefficient.There are nano-engineered designs,which at least have been analyzed theoretically,that show the potential to be very lightweight,very inexpensive, very efficient,and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way.Nano-engineered fuel cellscould provide the energy where it's needed.That's a key trend, which is decentralization,moving from centralized nuclear power plants andliquid natural gas tankersto decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly,a lot more efficientand capable and safe from disruption.Bono spoke very eloquently,that we have the tools, for the first time,to address age-old problems of disease and poverty.Most regions of the world are moving in that direction.In 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region,there were 500 million people living in poverty --that number now is under 200 million.The World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million,which is a reduction of 95 percent.I did enjoy Bono's commentlinking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.Being from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself,I'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s,although we hung around Harvard Square.But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty,and I'm going to talk about those issues, if we have the will.Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology.That's been a strong interest of mine,and a theme that I've developed for some 30 years.I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project.That invariably, the world was a different placewhen I would introduce a technology.And, I noticed that most inventions fail,not because the R&amp;D department can't get it to work --if you look at most business plans, they will actually succeedif given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build --and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail, because the timing is wrong --not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed.So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends,and track where technology would be at different points in time,and began to build the mathematical models of that.It's kind of taken on a life of its own.I've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather dataon key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models.And you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future.And if you ask me,will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now,that's very hard to say.Will WiMax CDMA G3be the wireless standard three years from now? That's hard to say.But if you ask me, what will it costfor one MIPS of computing in 2010,or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in 2012,or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014,it turns out that those are very predictable.There are remarkably smooth exponential curvesthat govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.And I'm going to show you a small sample of this,but there's really a theoretical reasonwhy technology develops in an exponential fashion.And a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly.They think they're going to continueto develop a problemor address a problem using today's tools,at today's pace of progress,and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth.The Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990.We had our best Ph.D. students,our most advanced equipment around the world,we got 1/10,000th of the project done,so how're we going to get this done in 15 years?And 10 years into the project,the skeptics were still going strong -- says, "You're two-thirds through this project,and you've managed to only sequencea very tiny percentage of the whole genome."But it's the nature of exponential growththat once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes.Most of the project was done in the lastfew years of the project.It took us 15 years to sequence HIV --we sequenced SARS in 31 days.So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems.I'm going to show you just a few examplesof how pervasive this phenomena is.The actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas,is doubling every decade, according to our models.These are all logarithmic graphs,so as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100.It took us half a century to adopt the telephone,the first virtual-reality technology.Cell phones were adopted in about eight years.If you put different communication technologieson this logarithmic graph,television, radio, telephonewere adopted in decades.Recent technologies -- like the PC, the web, cell phones --were under a decade.Now this is an interesting chart,and this really gets at the fundamental reason whyan evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes --accelerate.They work through interaction -- they create a capability,and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.So the first step in biological evolution,the evolution of DNA -- actually it was RNA came first --took billions of years,but then evolution used that information-processing backboneto bring on the next stage.So the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved,took only 10 million years. It was 200 times faster.And then evolution used those body plansto evolve higher cognitive functions,and biological evolution kept accelerating.It's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process.So Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species,the species that combined a cognitive functionwith an opposable appendage --and by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb --so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power gripand fine motor coordination,and use our mental models to actually change the worldand bring on technology.But anyway, the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years,and then working through interaction,evolution used, essentially,the technology-creating species to bring on the next stage,which were the first steps in technological evolution.And the first step took tens of thousands of years --stone tools, fire, the wheel -- kept accelerating.We always used then the latest generation of technologyto create the next generation.Printing press took a century to be adopted;the first computers were designed pen-on-paper -- now we use computers.And we've had a continual acceleration of this process.Now by the way, if you look at this on a linear graph, it looks like everything has just happened,but some observer says, "Well, Kurzweil just put points on this graphthat fall on that straight line."So, I took 15 different lists from key thinkers,like the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendaron the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point;these were just lists in reference works,and I think that's what they thought the key events werein biological evolution and technological evolution.And again, it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the linebecause people do have disagreements, what the key points are,there's differences of opinion when agriculture started,or how long the Cambrian Explosion took.But you see a very clear trend.There's a basic, profound acceleration of this evolutionary process.Information technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth,every year.And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth.A personal experience, when I was at MIT --computer taking up about the size of this room,less powerful than the computer in your cell phone.But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth,is just one example of many, because it's basicallya property of the evolutionary process of technology.I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph --by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth --that's another exponential.It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900,two years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year.And that's exponential growth through five different paradigms.Moore's Law was just the last part of that,where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit,but we had electro-mechanical calculators,relay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code,vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower,discreet transistors used in the first space flightsand then Moore's Law.Every time one paradigm ran out of steam,another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth.They were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller.That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum.Whole different paradigm -- transistors came out of the woodwork.In fact, when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm,it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm.And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Lawfor quite a long time -- the first prediction said 2002, until now it says 2022.But by the teen years,the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width,and we won't be able to shrink them any more.That'll be the end of Moore's Law, but it won't be the end ofthe exponential growth of computing, because chips are flat.We live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension.We will go into the third dimensionand there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years,of getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work.We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam.Supercomputers -- same thing.Processor performance on Intel chips,the average price of a transistor --1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar.You could buy 10 million in 2002.It's pretty remarkable how smoothan exponential process that is.I mean, you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment,but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior --countries accusing each other of dumping products,IPOs, bankruptcies, marketing programs.You would think it would be a very erratic process,and you have a very smoothoutcome of this chaotic process.Just as we can't predictwhat one molecule in a gas will do --it's hopeless to predict a single molecule --yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas,using thermodynamics, very accurately.It's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project,but the result of this whole worldwide,chaotic, unpredictable activity of competitionand the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable.And we can predict these trends far into the future.Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses,it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor.As we make them smaller and less expensive,the electrons have less distance to travel.They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors,so the cost of a cycle of one transistorhas been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years.You add other forms of innovation and processor design,you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year.And that's basically deflation --50 percent deflation.And it's not just computers. I mean, it's true of DNA sequencing;it's true of brain scanning;it's true of the World Wide Web. I mean, anything that we can quantify,we have hundreds of different measurementsof different, information-related measurements --capacity, adoption rates --and they basically double every 12, 13, 15 months,depending on what you're looking at.In terms of price performance, that's a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate.And economists have actually started worrying about that.We had deflation during the Depression,but that was collapse of the money supply,collapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena.This is due to greater productivity,but the economist says, "But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that.If you have 50 percent deflation, people may increase their volume30, 40 percent, but they won't keep up with it."But what we're actually seeing is thatwe actually more than keep up with it.We've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollarsin information technology over the last 50 years.I mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.As the price performance makes new applications feasible,new applications come to the market.And this is a very widespread phenomena.Magnetic data storage --that's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots,different engineers, different companies, same exponential process.A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biologyin these information terms.We're understanding the software programsthat make our body run.These were evolved in very different times --we'd like to actually change those programs.One little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene,basically says, "Hold onto every calorie,because the next hunting season may not work out so well."That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago.We'd like to actually turn that program off.They tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenouslyand remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim.They didn't get diabetes; they didn't get heart disease;they lived 20 percent longer; they got the health benefits of caloric restrictionwithout the restriction.Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this,felt that would beinteresting drug for the human market,and that's just one of the 30,000 genesthat affect our biochemistry.We were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of peopleat the age of most people at this conference, like myself,to live much longer, because we were using up the precious resourceswhich were better deployed towards the childrenand those caring for them.So, life -- long lifespans --like, that is to say, much more than 30 --weren't selected for,but we are learning to actually manipulateand change these software programsthrough the biotechnology revolution.For example, we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference.There are exciting new forms of gene therapythat overcome the problem of placing the genetic materialin the right place on the chromosome.There's actually a -- for the first time now,something going to human trials, that actually cures pulmonary hypertension --a fatal disease -- using gene therapy.So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers.And this technology is also accelerating.It cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990,then a penny in 2000.It's now under a 10th of a cent.The amount of genetic data --basically this shows that smooth exponential growthdoubled every year,enabling the genome project to be completed.Another major revolution: the communications revolution.The price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways;wired, wireless is growing exponentially.The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to,measured many different ways.This is based on the number of hosts.Miniaturization -- we're shrinking the size of technologyat an exponential rate,both wired and wireless.These are some designs from Eric Drexler's book --which we're now showing are feasiblewith super-computing simulations,where actually there are scientists buildingmolecule-scale robots.One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait,that's built out of molecules.There are little machines doing things in experimental bases.The most exciting opportunityis actually to go inside the human bodyand perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions.And this is less futuristic than it may sound.These things have already been done in animals.There's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes. It's blood cell-sized.They put tens of thousands of thesein the blood cell -- they tried this in rats --it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion,and actually cures type 1 diabetes.What you're watching is a designof a robotic red blood cell,and it does bring up the issue that our biologyis actually very sub-optimal,even though it's remarkable in its intricacy.Once we understand its principles of operation,and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating,we can actually design these things to bethousands of times more capable.An analysis of this respirocyte, designed by Rob Freitas,indicates if you replace 10 percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions,you could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath.You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours --so, "Honey, I'm in the pool," will take on a whole new meaning.It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials.Presumably we'll ban them,but then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gymsroutinely out-performing the Olympic athletes.Freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell.These are 2020-circa scenarios,but they're not as futuristic as it may sound.There are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices;there are many experiments in animals.There's actually one going into human trial,so this is feasible technology.If we come back to our exponential growth of computing,1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain.It will intersect human intelligencein terms of capacity in the 2020s,but that'll be the hardware side of the equation.Where will we get the software?Well, it turns out we can see inside the human brain,and in fact not surprisingly,the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.And with the new generation of scanning tools,for the first time we can actually seeindividual inter-neural fibersand see them processing and signaling in real time --but then the question is, OK, we can get this data now,but can we understand it?Doug Hofstadter wonders, well, maybe our intelligencejust isn't great enough to understand our intelligence,and if we were smarter, well, then our brains would be that much more complicated,and we'd never catch up to it.It turns out that we can understand it.This is a block diagram ofa model and simulation of the human auditory cortexthat actually works quite well --in applying psychoacoustic tests, gets very similar results to human auditory perception.There's another simulation of the cerebellum --that's more than half the neurons in the brain --again, works very similarly to human skill formation.This is at an early stage, but you can showwith the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brainand the exponential improvementin the resolution of brain scanning,we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brainby the 2020s.We've already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regionsout of the several hundred.All of this is drivingexponentially growing economic progress.We've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hourof labor in the last 50 years.E-commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars.You might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust?That was strictly a capital-markets phenomena.Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was,but then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models,they figured, well, that was wrong,and then we had this bust.All right, this is a technologythat we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in.This will be a routine feature in a cell phone.It would be able to translate from one language to another.So let me just end with a couple of scenarios.By 2010 computers will disappear.They'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment.Images will be written directly to our retina,providing full-immersion virtual reality,augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities.But if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends,and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screwin terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point.I mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-powergreater price performance, capacity and bandwidthof these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal.It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today.We'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain,1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerfulthan the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.Computers will combinethe subtle pan-recognition powersof human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior,in terms of doing analytic thinking,remembering billions of facts accurately.Machines can share their knowledge very quickly.But it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines.We are going to merge with our technology.These nano-bots I mentionedwill first be used for medical and health applications:cleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cellsand widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment.But they'll also go inside our brain,interact with our biological neurons.We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this.So, for example,full-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system,the nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses,replace them with the signals that your brain would be receivingif you were in the virtual environment,and then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment.You can go there with other people, have any kind of experiencewith anyone involving all of the senses."Experience beamers," I call them, will put their whole flow of sensory experiencesin the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet.You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else.But most importantly,it'll be a tremendous expansionof human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology,which in some sense we're doing already.We routinely do intellectual featsthat would be impossible without our technology.Human life expectancy is expanding. It was 37 in 1800,and with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions,this will move up very rapidlyin the years ahead.My main message is that progress in technologyis exponential, not linear.Many -- even scientists -- assume a linear model,so they'll say, "Oh, it'll be hundreds of yearsbefore we have self-replicating nano-technology assemblyor artificial intelligence."If you really look at the power of exponential growth,you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand.And information technology is increasingly encompassingall of our lives, from our music to our manufacturingto our biology to our energy to materials.We'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s,from information, in very inexpensive raw materials,using nano-technology.These are very powerful technologies.They both empower our promise and our peril.So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.Thank you very much.(Applause)



robert_fischell_on_medical_inventing
361379

I'm going to discuss with you three of my inventionsthat can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people,which we will hope to see happen.We discussed, in the prior film, some of the old things that we did,like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic.And I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventionsthat will change the lives of many people.At the present time, it takes an average of three hoursafter the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient,before that patient arrives at an emergency room.And people with silent ischemia --which, translated into English, means they don't have any symptoms --it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital.The AMI, Acute Myocardial Infarction,which is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money --(Laughter)-- means a heart attack. Annual incidence: 1.2 million Americans.Mortality: 300,000 people dying each year.About half of them, 600,000, have permanent damage to their heartthat will cause them to have very bad problems later on.Thus 900,000 people either have diedor have significant damage to their heart muscle.Symptoms are often denied by the patient, particularly us men,because we are very brave. We are very brave,and we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain.Then, approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms.What are we going to do about them? How can we save their lives?It's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women.Well, what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack?A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery.That, ladies and gentlemen, is a heart attack.The means consist of noting something a little technical,ST segment elevation of the electrogram --translated into English, that means thatif there's an electrical signal in the heart, and one part of the ECG --which we call the ST segment -- elevates,that is a sure sign of a heart attack.And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk,we could know, before they even have symptoms,that they're having a heart attack, to save their life.Well, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltagethat will trigger an emergency alarm,vibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone.And when it goes beep, beep, beep, you better do something about it,because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment.So we have to try these devices outbecause the FDA won't just let us use them on peopleunless we try it out first,and the best model for this happens to be pigs.And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin,like you see in an emergency room,and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well.And then we put a lead, which is a wire, in the right ventricle inside the heart,which does the electrogram, which is the signal voltage from inside the heart.Well, with the pig, at the baseline,before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal.After 43 seconds, even an expert couldn't tell the difference,and after three minutes -- well,if you really studied it, you'd see a difference.But what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart, to the electrogram?There was the baseline -- first of all, a much bigger and more reliable signal.Second of all, I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference,and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line.Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much --every layperson could see that difference,and computers can be programmed to easily detect it.Then, look at that after three minutes.We see that the signal that's actually in the heart,we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attackeven before they have symptoms so we can save their life.Then we tried it with my son, Dr. Tim Fischell,we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in.Well, he kept the balloon filled to block the artery,to simulate a blockage, which is what a heart attack is.And it's not hard to see that -- the baselineis the first picture on the upper left.Next to it, at 30 seconds, you see this rise here,then this rise -- that's the ST elevation.And if we had a computer that could detect it,we could tell you you're having a heart attack so earlyit could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure.And then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes laterand here you see, even after 10 seconds, a great rise in this piece,which we can have computers inside, under your chest like a pacemaker,with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker.And computers don't go to sleep.We have a little battery and on this little batterythat computer will run for five years without needing replacement.What does the system look like?Well, on the left is the IMD, which is Implantable Medical Device,and tonight in the tent you can see it -- they've exhibited it.It's about this big, the size of a pacemaker.It's implanted with very conventional techniques.And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table.It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency roomwhen the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo.And then, finally, a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation,which is the level which says you are having a heart attack.The FDA says, OK, test this final device after it's built in some animal,which we said is a pig, so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack.And when you go to the farmyard, you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks,so we said, well, we're experts in stents.Tonight you'll see some of our invented stents.We said, so we'll put in a stent,but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people.We're putting in a copper stent,and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks.That's not very nice, but, after all, we had to find out what the answer is.So we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig,and let me show you the result that's very gratifyingas far as people who have heart disease are concerned.So there it was, Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medicationand there is his electrogram, the signal from inside the pig's heartcoming out by radio telemetry.Then, on Friday at 6:43, he began to get certain signs,which later we had the pig run around --I'm not going to go into this early stage.But look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig's medicationthat kept him from having a heart attack.Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there?Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS -- you see ST elevation?This pig at 10:06 was having a heart attack.What happens after you have the heart attack, this blockage?Your rhythm becomes irregular, and that's what happened 45 minutes later.Then, ventricular fibrillation, the heart quivers instead of beats --this is just before death of the pig -- and then the pig died; it went flat-line.But we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life.Well, because of the FDA, we didn't save the pig's life,because we need to do this type of animal research for humans.But when it comes to the sake of a human, we can save their life.We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack.What is the response to acute myocardial infarction, a heart attack, today?Well, you feel some chest pain or indigestion.It's not all that bad; you decide not to do anything.Several hours pass and it gets worse, and even the man won't ignore it.Finally, you go to the emergency room.You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated,because 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest painsdon't have AMI, so you're not taken very seriously.They finally see you. It takes more timeto get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it,and it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data,which the computer we put in you gets.Finally, if you're lucky, you are treated in three or four hours after the incident,but the heart muscle has died.And that is the typical treatment in the advanced world -- not Africa --that's the typical treatment in the advanced world today.So we developed the AngelMed Guardian Systemand we have a device inside this patient, called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian.And when you have a blockage, the alarm goes offand it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device,which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours agoand the one that caused the alarm, so you can take it to the emergency roomand show them, and say, take care of me right away.Then it goes to a network operations center,where they get your data from your patient databasethat's been put in at some central location, say, in the United States.Then it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack,your signal appears on the screen of a computerand the computer analyzes what your problem is.And the person who's there, the medical practitioner, calls you --this is also a cell phone -- and says,"Mr. Smith, you're in deep doo-doo; you have a problem.We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way.It'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.We're going to send him the signal that we have, that says you have a heart attack,and we're going to send the signal to the hospitaland we're going to have it analyzed there,and there you're going to be with your doctorand you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack."That's the first invention that I wanted to describe.(Applause)And now I want to talk about something entirely different.At first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problembecause I'd never had a migraine headache,but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life,and their lives are being totally ruined by it.We have a mission statement for our company doing migraine, which is,"Prevent or ameliorate migraine headachesby the application of a safe, controlled magnetic pulseapplied, as needed, by the patient."Now, you're probably very few physicists here.If you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law,which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water --that's your brains by the way --it'll generate electric currents, and the electric current in the braincan erase a migraine headache.That's what we have discovered.So here's a picture of what we're doing.The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aurahave a band of excited neurons -- that's shown in red --that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain.And when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins.There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura,and this visual aura, by the way -- and I'll show you a picture --but it sort of begins with little dancing lights,gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field.And what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10.Weighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter.And here's one of the patients who has an auraand always has a headache, bad one, after the aura. What do we do?This is what an aura looks like.It's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side.And that's a fully developed visual aura, as we see on top.In the middle, our experimentalist, the neurologist, who said,"I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura."And, by God, the neurologist did erase it, and that's the middle picture:half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse.What does that mean?That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric currentthat's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain.And finally he says, "OK, now I'm going to -- "all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse.What is the result? We designed a magnetic depolarizerthat looks like this, that you could have -- a lady, in her pocket book --and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works.Well, the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News,Channel 7, last week in New York City, in the 11 o'clock news.Anchor: For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches --and there are 30 million Americans who do -- tonight: a possible answer.Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight, with a small and portable machinethat literally zaps your migraines away.Christina Sidebottom: Well, my first reaction was that it was --looked awfully gun-like, and it was very strange.Stacy Sager: But for Christina Sidebottom, almost anything was worth tryingif it could stop a migraine.It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse,but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper,say it is scientifically sound --that, in fact, when the average person gets a migraine,it's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse.The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that.Yousef Mohammed: In other words, we're treating electricity with electricity,rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays.SS: But is it safe to use everyday?Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade,and more long-term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it.CS: It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine.SS: Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer.Robert Fischell: And that is the invention to treat migraines.(Applause)You see, the problem is, 30 million Americans have migraine headaches,and we need a means to treat it, and I think that we now have it.And this is the first device that we did, and I'm going to talk about my second wish,which has something to do with this.Our conclusions from our studies so far, at three research centers,is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once.The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times,and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches,not only those with aura, get treated and get diminished.And auras can be erased and the migraine, then, does not occur.And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on.(Applause)The third and last invention began with an idea.Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation.Now, why do we use -- add on, nearly, an epileptic focus?Now, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono,have to get into all these technical words.Well, "responsive electrical stimulation" meansthat we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an "epileptic focus,"which is where the epileptic seizure begins --we sense there, that it's going to happen,and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot,which erases the errant signalso that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache.We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.We thought we could adapt it for the brain.The device could be implanted under the scalpto be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage,which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around.Form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy,as well as other diseases of the brain, because all diseases of the brainare a result of some electrical malfunction in it,that causes many, if not all, of brain disorders.We formed a company called NeuroPaceand we started work on responsive neurostimulation,and this is a picture of what the device looked like,that's placed into the cranial bone.This is probably a better picture.Here we have our device in which we put in a frame.There's a cut made in the scalp; it's opened; the neurosurgeon has a template;he marks it around, and uses a dental burrto remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device.And tonight, you'll be able to see the device in the tent.And then with four screws, we put in a frame,then we snap in the device and we run with wires --the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes,to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy,where we can sense the electrical signaland have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical currentto prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.In the blue wire, we see what's called a deep brain electrode.If that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well.The comprehensive solution: this is the device;it's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough,just the thickness of most cranial bones.The advantages of responsive neurostimulation:It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur,provide stimulation only when needed,can be turned off if seizures disappear; it has minimal side effects --as a matter of fact, in all our clinical trials to date,we've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it's been implanted --and it's invisible, cosmetically hidden,so, if you have epilepsy and you have the device,no one will know it because you can't tell that it's there.And this shows what an electroencephalogram is,and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients.Then we stimulated, and you see how that heavy black lineand then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal,which means they did not get the epileptic seizure.That concludes my discussion of epilepsy,which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon.(Applause)I have three wishes. Well, I can't do much about Africa.I'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry,which is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about.The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator,called RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator -- that's a brilliant acronym --for the treatment of other brain disorders.Well, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else?Then you saw what that device looked like,that the woman was using to fix her migraines?I tell you this: that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct,not a real designer of good equipment.(Laughter)We want to have some people, who really know how to do this,perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum designfor the portable device for treating migraine headaches.And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations.Then we're going to challenge the TED attendeesto come up with a way to improve health care in the USA,where we have problems that Africa doesn't have.And by reducing malpractice litigation --malpractice litigation is not an African problem; it's an American problem.(Applause)So, to get quickly to my first wish --the brain operates by electrical signals.If the electrical signals create a brain disorder,electro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons.In other words, if you've screwed up electrical signals,maybe, by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain,we can counteract that.A signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunctionmight be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulationlike we're doing with epilepsy.But even if there is no signal,electro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder.And consider treating psychotic disorders --and I want this involved with the TED group --such as obsessive-compulsive disorderthat, presently, is not well treated with drugs, and includes five million Americans.And Mr. Fischer, and his group at NeuroPace, and myself believethat we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world.That is the first wish.(Applause)The second wish is, at the present time,the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators --that's what TMS means, device to treat migraine headaches --appears to be quite successful.Well, that's the good news.The present portable device is far from optimally designed,both as to human factors as appearance.I think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns.(Laughter)Engage a company having prior successesfor human factors engineering and industrial designto optimize the design of the first portable TMS devicethat will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches.And that is the second wish.(Applause)And, of the 100,000-dollar prize money, that TED was so generous to give me,I am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace peopleto get on with the treatment of OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder,and I'm making another 50,000 available for a companyto optimize the design of the device for migraines.And that's how I'll use my 100,000-dollar prize money.(Applause)Well, the third and final wish is somewhat --unfortunately, it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers.(Laughter)Well, medical malpractice litigation in the UShas escalated the cost of malpractice insurance,so that competent physicians are leaving their practice.Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big shareof a big settlement by a sympathetic jury, because this patient really ended up badly.The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs.I've seen pictures, graphs in today's USA Todayshowing it skyrocketing out of control, and this is one factor.Well, how can the TED community help with this situation?I have a couple of ideas to begin with.As a starting point for discussion with the TED group,a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extentof informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign.For example, I asked the epilepsy peoplewhat are they using for informed consent.Would you believe, 12 pages, single space,the patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy?What do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages?They don't understand what the hell it's about.(Laughter)That's the present system. How about making a video?We have entertainment people here;we have people who know how to do videos,with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation.Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thingthat can be interactive with the patient, where they see the videoand they're being videoed and they press, do you understand this? No, I don't.Well, then let's go to a simpler explanation.Then there's a simpler one and, oh yes, I understand that.Well, press the button and you're on record, you understand.And that is one of the ideas.Now, also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter,with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done,including all the possible failure modes.The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuitif one of the known procedure failures occurs.Now, in America, in fact, you cannot give up your right to trial by jury.However, if a video is there that everything was explained to you,and you have it all in the video file,it'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyerwill take this case on contingency, because it won't be nearly as good a case.If a medical error occurs, the patient or spouse agrees to a settlementfor fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court.That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United Statesand would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone.These are just some starting points.And, so there, that's the end of all my wishes.I wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are.(Applause)

I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.We're entering a second generation of no progressin terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youthto go out and continue this very important thingthat we as a species have always done.And that is, instinctively we've gone outand climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.And I feel very stronglythat it's not good enough for us to have generations of kidsthat think that it's OK to look forward to a better versionof a cell phone with a video in it.They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;they need to look forward to breakthroughs.We need to inspire them, because they need to lead usand help us survive in the future.I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrineto -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.(Laughter)What we're looking forward to is --(Applause)what we're looking forward tois not only the inspiration of our children,but the current plan right now is not really even allowingthe most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed'sspace engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's --the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,is that right back to where we inspire peoplewho will be our great leaders later.That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.What they look at is the most important thing.Let's take a snapshot at aviation.And there was a wonderful little short four-year time periodwhen marvelous things happened.It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said,"Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flownin early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes,thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried,and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.The ones that flew and landed OKbecause there were no trained pilotswho had good flying qualities by definition.So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,in that four-year time period, we invented the conceptsof the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.That has not happened at all in space flying.There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.Well, who was inspired during that time period?Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thoughtwere the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of themwas a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on thereshowing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interestingthan it is now. We thought there'd be animals there;we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robotsand they've landed it only in the deserts.(Laughter)If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,and the red line is top-of-the-line military fightersand the blue line is commercial air transport.You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid --and I think that had something to do with giving me the courageto go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.Well, what did I do when I was a kid?I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancingand, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.I spent about seven years during the Vietnam Warflight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanesthat people could build in their garages.And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of themis around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,which is my company now.And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designedonly a dozen years after the first operational jet.Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon,take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys --that's kind of cool.We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow,have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.These things tend to happen every 25 years.40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statementon all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing --by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travelis the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cyclesif the government develops and the government uses it.You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity,all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.Keep that in mind. I put down innovation --I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five mannedspace flights in the world -- the very first year.In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.There were only three or four flights in 2003.In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flightsto the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojavewith my little group of a couple dozen peoplein order to get to a total of five,which was the number the same year back in 1961.There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.This is a picture here taken from orbit.Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough --at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courageto go out and try that as a small company.Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.There's another one announced just last week.And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbitalis, there is not solutions for adequate safetyto fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this --three governments have been doing this for 45 years,and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.I can't tell you when this will start,because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.But I think once it does, we will find solutions,and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moonso you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere --you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.Oh, it's going to be so much fun.(Laughter)OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spendinga lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978and I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger." OK.(Laughter)Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer,but the home computer was for games.For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,big development, big improvement and capability and so on,and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.And the inventor is in this audience.Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that,something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me --a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research,our communication and, if we let the Google guysthink for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter)And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kidsthat we didn't always have computers in our homes.So fun is defendable.OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart,but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.And in it also brings up another point, right here.There's a group of people that have come forward --and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forwardwere inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,by us going to orbit and going to the moon here,right in this time period.Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an areaof a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very --areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,and it will lead us into the next really big thingand it will allow us to explore. And I think eventuallyit will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.There were a couple of examples here.The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplanewas the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly,and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.It went a whole life cycle without competition,took out of service. And we're stuck back herewith the same kind of capability for military fightersand commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.But something is out there to inspire our kids now.And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,or if you've got a 10-year-old now.What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticketand fly higher and faster than the highest-performancemilitary operational airplane. It's never happened before.The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performancehas been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;why do you need something better?But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flyingsub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute,what's happening here, we'll have military fighterswith sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.OK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it.You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige,because we lost the first two milestones.We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardwareto put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it --you can argue that's not a technical loss.Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,and that was a very strong thing.And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lostto the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America --can't do it. You can buy it in Russia.You can fly with Russian hardware. This is availablebecause a Russian space program is starving,and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a tripto go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s,when the space race was going on,that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to doto buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japaneseor an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful,private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.I think you kind of see the same kind of parallelwhen the commercial stuff is offered.OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.This little thing says here: five timeswhat NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, alreadythere's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billioninvestment in private space flight that is not government at all --already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it,you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of thatbeing committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committedand planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be --and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollarson something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,or less -- this is going to be very profitable.I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into thiswill be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayerspends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficientlyby a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,will be at a level of about five times as muchas the current NASA budgets for human space flight.And that is because it's us. It's private industry.You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA,never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.But NASA is developing the space liner, always has,and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from itbecause we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004,when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.OK, thank you very much.(Applause)

Video: Narrator: An event seen from one point of viewgives one impression.Seen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression.But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understandwhat's going on.Sasha Vucinic: It's a great clip, isn't it?And I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more aboutthe power of, and importance of, independent mediathan I could say in an hour.So I thought that it will be good to start with it.And also start with a little bit of statistics.According to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planetlives in the societies without independent press.Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planetdoes not really know what is going on in their countries.The information they get gets filtered through somebodywho either twists that information, or colors that information,does something with it.So they're deprived of understanding their reality.That is just to understand how big and important this problem is.Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societiesthat represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts.You know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino.Enjoy it while it lasts.Because as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags,but they can also lose press freedom,as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about.But that's totally another and separate topic.So I can go back to my story.My story starts -- the story I want to share -- starts in 1991.At that time I was running B92, the only independent,for that matter the only electronic media, in the country.And I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the onlyindependent media in the country, operating in hostile environment,where government really wants to make your life miserable.And there are different ways.Yeah, it was the usual cocktail:a little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice,a little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control,so you always have somebody who never leaves your office.But what they really do, which is very powerful,and that is what governments in the late '90s started doingif they don't like independent media companies --you know, they threaten your advertisers.Once they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually,you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come --no matter how much does it make sense for them --do not want to come and advertise.And you have a problem making ends meet.At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem,which was, you know, survival below one side,but what was really painful for me was,remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall,in a slow-motion downfall.And we all had all of that on tapes.We had the ability to understand what was going on.We were actually recording history.The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later;because if we did not, we could not afford enough tapesto keep archives of that history.So if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that.In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.It was still 1991.He was running a media systems organizationwhich is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.And what did I know at that time about media systems?I would think media systems were organizations,which means they should help you.So I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans:the small one and the big one.The small one was, I just wanted himto help us get those damn tapes,so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.The big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan.Because I thought, I still maintain,that serious and independent media companies are great business.And I thought that B92 will survive and be a great companyonce Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true.It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggestmedia company in the country.And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that timewas 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.To make a long story short, the gentleman comes into the office,great suit and tie.I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanationof the political situation and explained how hard and difficultthe war will be.Actually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit.Anyway, after that whole, big, long explanation,the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke --is, are we paying royalties after we broadcast musicof Michael Jackson?That was really the only question he had.He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myselfbecause I thought there must be an institution in the worldthat is providing loans to media companies.It's so obvious, straight in your face,and somebody must have thought of it.Somebody must have started something like that.And I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it.You know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time;you could not just Google in '91.So I thought that that's actually my problem.Now we go from here, fast forward to 1995.I have -- I left the country, I have a meeting with George Soros,trying for the third time to convince him thathis foundation should invest in something that shouldoperate like a media bank.And basically what I was saying is very simple.You know, forget about charity; it doesn't work.Forget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.It's business anywhere.Media business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.And what these guys need, actually, is access to capital.So third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised.At the end of the meeting he says,look, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back;but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea.See that it will not work.He said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself.(Laughter)I knew two things after that meeting.First, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.And second, that I have no idea how to make it work.You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.But it's one thing to have a concept;it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work.Had the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.You see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here;I apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world.You know, you find somebody who is respectableand has a lot of money.You give them more money; they repay you that over a time.You collect interest and do nothing in between.So I thought, why don't we get into that business?(Laughter)So here we are having our first client, brilliant.First independent newspaper in Slovakia.The government cutting them offfrom all the printing facilities in Bratislava.So here's the daily newspaperthat has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital.It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.That means that they have no sports;they have no latest news; circulation goes down.It's a kind of very nice, sophisticated wayhow to economically strangle a daily newspaper.They come to us with a request for a loan.They want to -- the only way for them to surviveis to get a printing press.And we said, that's fine; let's meet;you'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.We start the meeting.I get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format,so it's much bigger.A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.But however you put it, you know, the numbersdo not make any sense.And that's the best they could do.We were the best that they could do.So that is how we understood what our method is.It's not a bank. We had to actuallygo into these companies and earn our returnby fixing them -- by establishing management systems,by providing all that knowledge, how do you run a businesson one side -- while they all know how to run, how to create content.Just quickly on the results.Over these 10 years, 40 million dollars in affordable financing,average interest rate five percent to six percent.Lately we are going wild, charging seven percent from time to time.We do it in 17 countries of the developing world.And here is the most stunning number.Return rate -- the one that Soros was so worried about -- 97 percent.97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time.What do we typically finance?We finance anything that a media company would need,from printing presses to transmitters.What is most important is we do iteither in form of loans, equities, lease --whatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody.But what is most important here is, who do we finance?We believe that in the last 10 years companiesthat we've financed are actually the best media companiesin the developing world.That is a "Who is Who" list.And I could spend hours talking about them,because they're all kind of heroes.And I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one,and depending on time I may give you two exampleswho we work with.You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe,and moved to Russia.Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.In the south of Russia there's a guy calledBoris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is runningan independent newspaper there.The city was closed until early '90sbecause, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.Anyway, he's running independent newspaper there.After two years working with us, he becomesthe most respected newspaper in that small place.Governor comes to him one day,actually invites him to come to his office.He goes and sees the governor. The governor says,Boris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job,and you are the most respected newspaper in our district.And I want to offer you a deal.Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months,because I have elections --there are elections coming up in nine months.I will not run, but it's very important for mewho is going to succeed me.So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.I have no interest in being in media business.How much would that cost?Boris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale."The governor says, "We will close you."Boris Nikolayevich says, "No, you cannot do it."Six months later the newspaper was closed.Luckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevichtake all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one,to get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.So what the governor got was an empty shell.But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media,and if you are a banker for independent media.So it sounds like a great story.Somewhere down the road we opened a media management center.We started our media lab, sounds like a real great story.But there is a second angle to that.The second angle, like in this clip.If you take the camera above, you start thinkingabout these numbers again.40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries.That is not too much, is it?It's actually just a drop in the sea.Because when you think about the importance,some of the issues that we were talking about last night --this last session we had about Africa and hishypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa.All of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night --government accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption,giving voice to unheard, to poor --it's why independent media is in business.And it's why it was invented.So from that perspective, what we did is just reallyone drop in the sea of that need that we can identify.Now ours is just one story.I'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful storiesof nonprofits doing spectacular work.Here is where the problem is,and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.And it's called fundraising.Imagine that this third of this room is filledwith people who represent different foundations.Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations,doing very important work.Now imagine that every second person over hereis deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off.Now that is how difficult it is to match peoplefrom this side of the roomwith people of that side of the room.So we thought that some kind of a big idea is neededto reform, to totally rethink fundraising.You know, instead of people running in this dark,trying to find their own match, who will be willing,who has the same goals.Instead of all of that we thought there is --something new needs to be invented.And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds,press freedom bonds.If there are investors willing to financeU.S. government budget deficit,why wouldn't we find investors willing to financepress freedom deficit?We've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them,probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars.I don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.But the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them,find enough investors that this can be considered a success,there's nothing stopping the next organizationto start to issue bonds next spring.And those can be environmental bonds.And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue hiselectricity in Bangladesh bonds.And before you know it, any social causecan be actually financed in this way.Now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left.But let's take the idea further.You do it, you start it in the States, because it's,you know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.But you can actually bring it to Europe, too.You can bring it to Asia.You can, once you have all of those different points,you can make it easy for investors.Put all of those bonds at one placeand they sit down and click.Once you have more than 10 of themyou have to develop some kind of a matrix.What do investors get?On one side financial, on the other side social.So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency,Morningstar type.It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.Financial, they give you one percent, only one star.Now take it to the last step.Once you have all of that put together,there's not one reason why you couldn't actually havea marketplace for all of that,where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.And in that way you organize the financingso there are no dark rooms, no blind peoplerunning around to find each other.Thank you.

A public, Dewey long ago observed,is constituted through discussion and debate.If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question,and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned,then we must be willing to subject our own assumptionsto debate and discussion.It is in this spirit that I join into a discussionof one of the critical issues of our time,namely, how to mobilize different forms of capitalfor the project of state building.To put the assumptions very clearly:capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable,and so has democracy.If we looked in the world of 1945and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities,they were the rare exception, not the norm.The question now, however,is both about which form of capitalismand which type of democratic participation.But we must acknowledgethat this moment has brought abouta rare consensus of assumptions.And that provides the groundfor a type of action,because consensus of each momentallows us to act.And it is necessary, no matter how fragileor how provisional our consensus,to be able to move forward.But the majority of the worldneither benefits from capitalismnor from democratic systems.Most of the globeexperiences the state as repressive,as an organization that is concernedabout denial of rights,about denial of justice,rather than provision of it.And in terms of experience of capitalism,there are two aspectsthat the rest of the globe experiences.First, extractive industry.Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds,timber,that is cut right from under the poorest.Second is technical assistance.And technical assistance might shock you,but it's the worst formof -- today -- of the ugly faceof the developed world to the developing countries.Tens of billions of dollarsare supposedly spent on building capacitywith people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day,who are incapableof thinking creatively,or organically.Next assumption --and of course the events of July 7,I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 --have reminded uswe do not live in three different worlds.We live in one world.But that's easily said.But we are not dealing with the implicationsof the one world that we are living in.And that is that if we want to have one world,this one world cannot be basedon huge pockets of exclusion,and then inclusion for some.We must now finally cometo think about the premisesof a truly global world,in relationship to the regime of rightsand responsibilities and accountabilitiesthat are truly global in scope.Otherwise we will be missingthis open moment in history,where we have a consensuson both the form of politicsand the form of economics.What is one of these organizations to pick?We have three critical terms:economy,civil societyand the state.I will not deal with those first two, except to saythat uncritical transfer of assumptions,from one context to another,can only make for disaster.Economicstaught in most of the elite universitiesare practically useless in my context.My country is dominatedby drug economy and a mafia.Textbook economics does not work in my context,and I have very few recommendations from anybodyas to how to put together a legal economy.The poverty of our knowledgemust become the first basisof moving forward,and not imposition of the frameworkthat works on the basis of mathematical modeling,for which I have enormous respect.My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best.Second,instead of debating endlesslyabout what is the structure of the state,why don't we simplifyand say, what are a series of functionsthat the state in the 21st century must perform?Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this;we hope to share that much widely with --and third is that we could actually construct an indexto measure comparativelyhow well these functions that we would agree onare being performed in different places.So what are these functions?We propose 10.And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence,administrative control, management of public finances,investment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights,provision of infrastructure,management of the tangible and intangible assets of the statethrough regulation, creation of the market,international agreements, including public borrowing,and then, most importantly, rule of law.I won't elaborate.I hope the questions will give me an opportunity.This is a feasible goal,basically because, contrary to widespread assumption,I would argue that we know how to do this.Who would have imagined that Germanywould be either united or democratic today,if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943?But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germanyand engaged in planning.And there are lots of other examples.Now in order to do this -- and this brings this group --we have to rethink the notion of capital.The least important form of capital, in this project,is financial capital -- money.Money is not capital in most of the developing countries.It's just cash.Because it lacks the institutional,organizational, managerial formsto turn it into capital.And what is requiredis a combination of physical capital,institutional capital, human capital --and security, of course, is critical,but so is information.Now, the issue that should concern us here --and that's the challengethat I would like to pose to this group --is again, it takes 16 yearsin your countriesto produce somebody with a B.S. degree.It takes 20 yearsto produce somebody with a Ph.D.The first challenge is to rethink,fundamentally,the issue of the time.Do we need to repeatthe modalities that we have inherited?Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century.What is it that we need to do fundamentallyto re-engage in a project,that capital formation is rapid?The absolute majority of the world's populationare below 20,and they are growing larger and faster.They need different waysof being approached,different ways of being enfranchised,different ways of being skilled.And that's the first thing.Second is, you're problem solvers,but you're not engaging your global responsibility.You've stayed awayfrom the problems of corruption.You only want clean environments in which to function.But if you don't think through the problems of corruption,who will?You stay away from design for development.You're great designers,but your designs are selfish.It's for your own immediate use.The world in which I operateoperates with designsregarding roads, or dams,or provision of electricitythat have not been revisited in 60 years.This is not right. It requires thinking.But, particularly, what we needmore than anything else from this groupis your imaginationto be brought to bear on problemsthe way a meme is supposed to work.As the work on paradigms, long time ago showed --Thomas Kuhn's work --it's in the intersection of ideasthat new developments --true breakthroughs -- occur.And I hope that this groupwould be able to deal with the issue of state and developmentand the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor,through this means.Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: So, Ashraf, until recently,you were the finance minister of Afghanistan,a country right at the middleof much of the world's agenda.Is the country gonna make it?Will democracy flourish? What scares you most?Ashraf Ghani: What scares me most is -- is you,lack of your engagement.(Laughter)You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer.No. But seriously,the issue of Afghanistanfirst has to be seen as,at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective.Today the world of globalizationis on speed.Time has been compressed.And space does not exist for most people.But in my world --you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years,space had expanded.Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down.I rode -- traveled --travel between two cities that used to take three hoursnow took 12.So the first is when the scale is that,we need to recognizethat just the simple things that are infrastructure --it takes six years to deliver infrastructure.In our world.Any meaningful sort of thing.But the modality of attention,or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow.Second is,when a country has been subjectedto one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power --we had the Red Armyfor 10 continuous years,110,000 strong,literally terrorizing.The sky:every Afghansees the sky as a source of fear.We were bombedpractically out of existence.Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism --from all sides.The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance,Egyptian intelligence serviceto train thousands of peoplein resistance and urban terrorism.How to turn a bicycleinto an instrument of terror.How to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything.And the Russians, equally.So, when violence eruptsin a country like Afghanistan,it's because of that legacy.But we have to understandthat we've been incredibly lucky.I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here,standing in front of you, speaking.When I joined as finance minister,I thought that the chances of my living more than three yearswould not be more than five percent.Those were the risks. They were worth it.I think we can make it,and the reason we can make itis because of the people.You see, because, I mean -- I give you one statistic.91 percent of the men in Afghanistan,86 percent of the women,listen to at least three radio stations a day.In terms of their discourse,in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world,I think that I would dare say,they're much more sophisticatedthan rural Americans with college degreesand the bulk of Europeans --because the world matters to them.And what is their predominant concern?Abandonment.Afghans have become deeply internationalist.You know, when I went back in December of 2001,I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan governmentbecause I'd lived as a nationalist.And I told them -- my people, with the Americans here --separate.Yes, I have an advisory position with the U.N.I went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly.And everybody was telling me it was a different world.You know, they engage.They see engagement, global engagement,as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people.And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is --Clare Lockhart is here,so I'll recite a discussion she hadwith an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan.And that woman said she didn't carewhether she had food on her table.What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future,where her children could really have a different life.That gives me hope.CA: How is Afghanistangoing to provide alternative incometo the many peoplewho are making their living off the drugs trade?AG: Certainly. Well, the first is,instead of sending a billion dollarson drug eradicationand paying it to a couple of security companies,they should give this hundred billion dollarsto 50of the most critically innovative companies in the worldto ask them to create one million jobs.The key to the drug eradication is jobs.Look, there's a very little known fact:countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollarsdon't produce drugs.Second, textile.Trade is the key, not aid.The U.S. and Europeshould give us a zero percent tariff.The textile industry is incredibly mobile.If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment,we could probably attractfour to six billion dollarsquite easily in the textile sector,if there was zero tariffs --would create the type of job.Cotton does not compete with opium;a t-shirt does.And we need to understand, it's the value chain.Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tiredof hearing about microcredit.It is important,but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production wantis global access.They don't want to sell to the charity bazaarsthat are only for foreigners --and the same bloody shirtembroidered time and again.What we want is a partnershipwith the Italian design firms.Yeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world!Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy?With the Put Out system?So I think economically,the critical issue really is to now think through.And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.You know, the aid system is broken.The aid system does not have the knowledge,the vision, the ability.I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it.Yeah, to be exact, you know,I managed to persuade the world thatthey had to give my country 27.5 billion.They didn't want to give us the money.CA: And it still didn't work?AG: No. It's not that it didn't work.It's that a dollar of private investment,in my judgment,is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid,in terms of the dynamic that it generates.Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents;it could be 20 cents;or it could be four dollars.It depends on what form it comes,what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefitentrepreneurs of the developed countries,not to generate growth in the poor countries.And this is, again, one of those assumptions --the way car seats are an assumptionthat we've inherited in governments, and doors.You would think that the US governmentwould not think that American firms needed subsidizingto function in developing countries, provide advice,but they do.There's an entire weight of historyvis-a-vis aidthat now needs to be reexamined.If the goal is to build statesthat can credibly take care of themselves --and I'm putting that proposition equally;you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts --aid must endin each country in a definable period.And every year there must be progresson mobilization of domestic revenueand generation of the economy.Unless that kind of compact is entered into,you will not be able to sustain the consensus.

I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute.Before I tell that story, we should ask ourselves the question:Why does poverty exist?I mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs.We all live in the same planet,but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world.And I think -- so I want to throw a perspective that I have,so that we can assess this project, or any other project, for that matter,to see whether it's contributing or --contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it.Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years.And by and large, this has failed.And you can see this book,written by someone who worked in the World Bank for 20 years,and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive.By and large, it did not work.So the question is, why is that?In my mind, there is something to learn from the history of Europe.I mean, even here, yesterday I was walking across the street,and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago,right across the street from here.So my point is, there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe,where citizens were empowered by technologies.And they demanded authorities from --to come down from their high horses.And in the end, there's better bargainingbetween the authorities and citizens,and democracies, capitalism -- everything else flourished.And so you can see, the real process of --and this is backed up by this 500-page book --that the authorities came down and citizens got up.But if you look, if you have that perspective,then you can see what happened in the last 60 years.Aid actually did the opposite.It empowered authorities,and, as a result, marginalized citizens.The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happenso that they could tax peopleand make more money for to run their business.Because they were getting it from abroad.And in fact, if you see oil-rich countries,where citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes --Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries.Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way.It empowers authorities, without activating the citizens --their hands, legs, brains, what have you.And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countriesis to recognize that economic development is of the people,by the people, for the people.And that is the real network effect.If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive,so that their voices are heard,so then things would improve.And to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world,the World Bank, is an organization of the government,by the government, for the governments.Just see the contrast.And that is the perspective I have, and then I can start my story.Of course, how would you empower citizens?There could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones.Recently "The Economist" recognized this,but I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago,and that's what I've been working on.So 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.We had -- quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network.And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks;we could update each other more often.But one time it broke down.And it reminded me of a day in 1971.There was a war going on in my country.And my family moved out of an urban place, where we used to live,to a remote rural area where it was safer.And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling.And I walked 10 miles or so, all morning, to get there, to the medicine man.And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back.So I had another unproductive day.So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York,I put those two experiences together side by side,and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity --whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.So naturally, I -- the implication of that isthat the telephone is a weapon against poverty.And if that's the case, then the question ishow many telephones did we have at that time?And it turns out, that there was one telephone in Bangladeshfor every 500 people.And all those phones were in the few urban places.The vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived,there were no telephones.So just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted,just like I wasted a day.If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month,whatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted.And after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we've got equal,is their days are the same length: 24 hours.So if you lose that precious resource,where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries,that's a huge waste.So I started looking for any evidence that --does connectivity really increase productivity?And I couldn't find much, really, but I found this graph produced by the ITU,which is the International Telecommunication Union, based in Geneva.They show an interesting thing.That you see, the horizontal axis is where you place your country.So the United States or the UK would be here, outside.And so the impact of one new telephone,which is on the vertical axis, is very little.But if you come back to a poorer country, where the GNP per capita is,let's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars,then the impact is huge: 6,000 dollars. Or 5,000 dollars.The question was,how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh?It turns out: 2,000 dollars.So if you spend 2,000 dollars, and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years,and if 5,000 dollars every year -- so that's 50,000 dollars.So obviously this was a gadget to have.And of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down,because there's a digital revolution going on,then it would be even more dramatic.And I knew a little economics by then --it says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity.But how would you specialize?Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer.And Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists.So the point is that we could only -- the only way we could depend on each other,is if we can connect with each other.And if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house.But then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area.But in order to expand that, you need a river,or you need a highway, or you need telephone lines.But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability.And that leads to specialization.That leads to productivity.So the question was, I started looking at this issue,and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York.There were a lot of reasons people told mewhy we don't have enough telephones.And one of them is the lacking buying power.Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy.But the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that?I mean, in America, people buy cars,and they put very little money down.They get a car, and they go to work.The work pays them a salary;the salary allows them to pay for the car over time.The car pays for itself.So if the telephone is a production tool,then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power.And of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power?So then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access?In the United States, we have -- everybody needs a banking service,but very few of us are trying to buy a bank.So it's -- a bank tends to serve a whole community.So we could do that for telephones.And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet:food, clothing, shelter, whatever.But again, it's very paternalistic.You should be raising incomeand let people decide what they want to do with their money.But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures.See, you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing.For instance, the Internet was booming in the U.S.because there were -- there were people who had computers.They had modems.They had telephone lines, so it's very easy to bring in a new idea, like the Internet.But that's what's lacking in a poor country.So for example, we didn't have ways to have credit checks,few banks to collect bills, etc.But that's why I noticed Grameen Bank, which is a bank for poor people,and had 1,100 branches, 12,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers.And they had these branches.I thought I could put cell towers and create a network.And anyway, to cut the time short -- so I started --I first went to them and said,"You know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient."But you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones,so they are decentralized. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons,but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be.And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches,and then to be -- and rock the boat.So I started focusing. What is it that they really do?So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank.She typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk.And she sells the milk to the villagers, and pays off the loan.And this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else.And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow.Because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank,get a phone and have the phone for everybody.And it's a business for her.So I wrote to the bank, and they thought for a while, and they said,"It's a little crazy, but logical.If you think it can be done, come and make it happen."So I quit my job; I went back to Bangladesh.I created a company in America called Gonofone,which in Bengali means "people's phone."And angel investors in America put in money into that.I flew around the world.After about a million -- I mean, I got rejected from lots of places,because I was not only trying to go to a poor country,I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.After about a million miles, and a meaningful --a substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium, and --which involved the Norwegian telephone company,which provided the know-how,and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.To make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.You can see it's pretty much covered.Even in Bangladesh, there are some empty places.But we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this yearto extend that coverage.Now, about that cow model I talked about.There are about 115,000 people who are retailing telephone servicesin their neighborhoods.And it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people.And these phones are generatingabout 100 million dollars for the company.And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like 700 dollars per year.And of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways.It increases income, improves welfare, etc.And the result is, right now, this company is the largest telephone company,with 3.5 million subscribers,115,000 of these phones I talked about --that produces about a third of the traffic in the network.And 2004, the net profit, after taxes --very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars.And the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers.And again, here are some of the lessons."The government needs to provide economically viable services."Actually, this is an instance where private companies can provide that."Governments need to subsidize private companies."This is what some people think.And actually, private companies help governments with taxes."Poor people are recipients."Poor people are a resource."Services cost too much for the poor."Their involvement reduces the cost."The poor are uneducated and cannot do much."They are very eager learners and very capable survivors.I've been very surprised.Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day."Poor countries need aid."Businesses -- this one company has raised the --if the ideal figures are even five percent true, this one companyis raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives.And as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned,aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens.And this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen, the famous inventor in America.He has produced some power generators,which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh,in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas,which is running these generators.And each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each.It's just an experiment.We don't know how far it will go,but it's going on.Thank you.

I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin,from when I was 12 years old.My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater --at least I thought it was beautiful.And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach,and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind ofright across the chest, that were also fuzzy.And I wore it whenever I could,thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.Until one day in ninth grade,when I was standing with a number of the football players.And my body had clearly changed, and Matt,who was undeniably my nemesis in high school,said in a booming voice thatwe no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips,but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz.(Laughter)And I was so humiliated and mortifiedthat I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised herfor ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater awaysomewhat ceremoniously,my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweaternor see it ever again.Fast forward -- 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid.I'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes,when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy -- 11 years old --running toward me, wearing my sweater.And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible.But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of coursescaring the living bejesus out of him --grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my namewritten on the collar of this sweater.I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serveas a metaphor to me about the level of connectednessthat we all have on this Earth.We so often don't realize what our action and our inactiondoes to people we think we will never see and never know.I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual storyof what aid is and can be.That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia,and moved its way into the larger industry,which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia.Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing.And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda,it destroyed the local retailing industry.Not to say that it shouldn't have,but that we have to get better at answering the questionsthat need to be considered when we think about consequencesand responses.So, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986,where I was doing two things.I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers.We were called the "Bad News Bears," and our notion waswe were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali,which was not hard because there were no snacks before us.And because we had a good business model, we actually did it,and I watched these women transform on a micro-level.But at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank,and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen,which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks,which now is a worldwide movement -- you talk about a meme --but then it was quite new, especially in an economythat was moving from barter into trade.We got a lot of things right.We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game.The women made their own decisions at the end of the dayas to how they would use this access to creditto build their little businesses, earn more incomeso they could take care of their families better.What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us,with the confluence of fear, ethnic strifeand certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing intothis invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda,that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.The genocide happened in 1994,seven years after these women all worked togetherto build this dream.And the good news was that the institution,the banking institution, lasted.In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.The bakery was completely wiped out,but the lessons for me were that accountability counts --got to build things with people on the ground,using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say,the incentives matter.Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everythingthat was happening in the world,that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist,on the one hand I absolutely agree with him,and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 --that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bonoand Bob Geldof -- the world is talking about global poverty;the world is talking about Africain ways I have never seen in my life.It's thrilling.And at the same time, what keeps me up at nightis a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 --50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa,40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory,as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.And in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one,celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter twothat is all about execution, all about the how-to.And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today,it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history,is to build viable systems on the groundthat deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor,in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.If we do that, we really can make poverty history.And it was that -- that whole philosophy --that encouraged me to start my current endeavorcalled "Acumen Fund,"which is trying to build some mini-blueprintsfor how we might do that in water, health and housingin Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples,so you can see what it is that we're doing.But before I do this -- and this is another one of my pet peeves --I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are.Because we too often talk about them as thesestrong, huge masses of people yearning to be free,when in fact, it's quite an amazing story.On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.That's who we talk about when we think about "the poor."If you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth,and yet most of these people go invisible.Where we typically work, there's people making betweenone and three dollars a day.Who are these people?They are farmers and factory workers.They work in government offices. They're drivers.They are domestics.They typically pay for critical goods and services like water,like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 timeswhat their middleclass counterparts pay --certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi.The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions,if you give them that opportunity.So, two examples.One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers,most of whom make less than two dollars a day.Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches,and figure out how to do a drip irrigation,which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms,so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.A couple of principles:build small.Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unitwhen they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-towith a corrugated iron roof.After one harvest, they had increased their income enoughto buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.A couple of years later, I meet them.They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India,and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laidto build their house.And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes.Something I truly believe.You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets,and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvardhuge kudos for bringing to the worldthis notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life.Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.300 to 500 million cases are reported.It's estimated that Africa losesabout 13 billion dollars a year to the disease.Five dollars can save a life.We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars --why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?The question, though, is not "Why can't we?"The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves?A lot of hurdles.One: production is too low. Two: price is too high.Three: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located.Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible.We started by making a 350,000-dollar loanto the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africaso that they could transfer technology from Japanand build these long-lasting, five-year nets.Here are just some pictures of the factory.Today, three years later, the company has employedanother thousand women.It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.It's the largest company in Tanzania.The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets,three million by the end of the year.We hope to have seven million at the end of next year.So the production side is working.On the distribution side, though,as a world, we have a lot of work to do.Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.,and then given primarily to people around Africa.We're looking at buildingon some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.Their women.And so I want you to meet Jacqueline,my namesake, 21 years old.If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania,I'm telling you, she could run Wall Street.She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough moneyto put a down payment on her house.She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund,and told me she is not marrying nor having childrenuntil these things are completed.And so, when I told her about our idea --that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States,and find a way for the women themselves to go outand sell these nets to others --she quickly started calculating what she herself could makeand signed up.We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies,and quickly did a prototyping on this,and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.She brought 10 of the women with whom she interactstogether to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece,despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one,and we learned a lot about how you sell things.Not coming in with our own notions,because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end.First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty.These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house.Children can sleep through the night;the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window.And we've started making curtains,and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status --that you care about your children.Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives.A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sellgoods and services to the poor.I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunityto make poverty history.To do it right, we have to build business models that matter,that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians,people all over the developing worldwho fit in this category, to do it themselves.Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement.It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts,that they want to make their own decisions;they want to solve their own problems;and that by engaging with them,not only do we create much more dignity for them,but for us as well.And so I urge all of you to think next timeas to how to engage with this notion and this opportunitythat we all have -- to make poverty history --by really becoming part of the processand moving away from an us-and-them world,and realizing that it's about all of us,and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.Thank you.(Applause)

in case you missed them.The official dogma of what?And the official dogma runs like this:And because if people have freedom,then each of us can act on our ownand no one has to decide on our behalf.and the more freedom they have,the more welfare they have.I'll give you some examplesThis is my supermarket.Not such a big one.175 salad dressings in my supermarket,and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buySo this is what the supermarket is like.to set up a stereo system --there are that many stereo systems.There was a time, when I was a boy,as long as it came from Ma Bell.You rented your phone. You didn't buy it.And those days are gone.especially in the world of cell phones.These are cell phones of the future.My favorite is the middle one --(Laughter)And what this doesThe answer is "no."the same explosion of choice is true.Health care.Instead, you go to the doctor,A has these benefits, and these risks.B has these benefits, and these risks.What do you want to do?"And you say, "Doc, what should I do?"and B has these benefits and risks.What do you want to do?"And the doc says, "But I'm not you."which makes it sound like a good thing,namely, the doctor --namely, the patient.to people like you and me,since we can't buy them.Something as dramatic as our identityhas now become a matter of choice,as this slide is meant to indicate.With respect to marriage and family,The only real choice was who,not when, and not what you did after.I teach wonderfully intelligent students,And it's not because they're less smart,Should I get married later?All of these are consuming questions.And indeed they should.These are important questions to answer.Work --we are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,with the technology that enables usexcept the Randolph Hotel.(Laughter)(Applause)There is one corner, by the way,So what this means,is that we have to make a decision,again and again and again,We can go to watch our kid play soccer,and we have our cell phone on one hip,and our Blackberry on our other hip,and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.And even if they're all shut off,we are also asking ourselves,"Should I answer this cell phone call?very different than it would've been.So everywhere we look,life is a matter of choice.That is to say, there were some choices,but not everything was a matter of choice.[The Ten Commandments DYI Kit]And the answer is, "yes."(Laughter)We all know what's good about it,All of this choice has two effects,two negative effects on people.One effect, paradoxically,With so many options to choose from,the gigantic mutual-fund companyAnd what she foundthan if you only offer five.Why?Because with 50 funds to choose from,And then tomorrow,and tomorrow, and tomorrow,and of course tomorrow never comes.Understand that not only does this meanfrom the employer,(Laughter)So that's one effect.The second effectAnd there are several reasons for this.One of themthat would have been better.And what happensyou get out of the decision you made,even if it was a good decision.Dan Gilbert made a big point this morningdepends on what we compare them to.of alternatives that you rejectHere's an example.Sorry if you're not New Yorkers.Here's this couple on the Hamptons.Very expensive real estate.What could be better?"Well, damn it," this guy is thinking,And he spends two weeks nagged by the ideathat he is missing the opportunity,Opportunity costseven when what we choose is terrific.Here's another example.(Laughter)Now this cartoon makes a lot of points.and probably about doing things slowly.But one point it makesyou're choosing not to do other thingsthat may have lots of attractive features,Third: escalation of expectations.I wear jeans almost all the time.they were incredibly uncomfortable,they started to feel OK.And the shopkeeper said,Do you want them distressed?My jaw dropped.And after I recovered, I said,(Laughter)He had no idea what that was,(Laughter)and I walked out of the store -- truth! --I did better.But --I felt worse.The reason --(Laughter)The reason I felt worse is that,with all of these options available,Adding options to people's livesabout how good those options will be.even when they're good results.The truth is more like this.is that when everything was worse,it was actually possible for peoplewith perfection the expectation --the best you can ever hope forYou will never be pleasantly surprisedhave gone through the roof.the secret to happinessis low expectations.(Laughter)[You'll do](Applause)(Laughter)I want to say --just a little autobiographical moment --that I actually am married to a wife,and she's really quite wonderful.I couldn't have done better.I didn't settle.Finally --when there is only one kind to buywho's responsible,What could you do?and you buy one that is disappointing,and you ask why, who's responsible?You could have done better.there is no excuse for failure.And so when people make decisions,they feel disappointed about them;they blame themselves.Clinical depression has explodedbecause their standards are so high,they think they're at fault.and we feel worse.So let me remind you.and it's all false.It is not true.but it doesn't follow from thatwhere options improve our welfare.what enables all of this choiceThere are lots of places in the world,and we have heard about several of them,of modern, affluent, Western societies.Steve Levitt talked to you yesterdaydon't help.It's a waste of money.What I'm telling youit's not simply that they don't help.They actually hurt.They actually make us worse off.to make all of the choices we makebut ours would be improved also,not just poor people --So to conclude."Ah! What does this fish know?and that's the way I read it at first.The more I thought about it, however,Because the truth of the matteryou don't have freedom.You have paralysis.you decrease satisfaction.Everybody needs a fishbowl.and, I suspect, disaster.Thank you very much.(Applause)

but other people's tragedy.than your own,So, if you believe the media accounts,that the answer turns out not to beSo there are three things I want to do.Secondly, I want to tell youabout some of the things we foundthe books, of the gang.So before I do that, just one warning,It contains adult themes, adult language.that, in fact, there'll be no nudity --(Laughter)Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside.(Laughter)and how it transformed the gang.the early '80s, let me say.The gang had no way to make money.marijuana's too cheap, it turns out.You can't get rich selling marijuana.You couldn't sell cocaine;but you've got to know rich white people.so couldn't sell to that market.you were living at home with your mother.And so it wasn't really a career.Then along comes crack cocaine.And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell,for the inner city.(Laughter)I would say that in the last 25 years,the biggest one in terms of impactwas crack cocaine.It had a huge impact on life.So what was it about crack cocaine?than snorting it.but when it came, it really did.And it was a perfect drug;sell it for five dollars.and then when you come down,all you want to do is get high again.It created a wonderful market.At least for the people on the top.So this is where we enter the picture.came to the University of Chicago.he had spent following the Grateful Dead.Defied all kinds of boundaries:He was really a curious sight to be seen.gets to the first building.You don't like to be surprised.(Laughter)So -- I kid you not --(Laughter)Makes you wonder about academics.(Laughter)So the choice of answers were:[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad](Laughter)(Laughter)There was a lot of gunfire,By morning, the gang leader arrived,and they let him go home.(Laughter)Sudhir, on the other hand,went up to the second floor,I wonder if I could do it again tonight."having the windows shot out of his car,you name it.And especially for me,that he would get from the gang.(Laughter)(Laughter)So what did we find?What did we find in the gang?Well, let me say one thing:to the point where they actually opened upthe financial records they kept.and any other organization,So first, in one way,the way it looks.this is exactly what it would look like.(Laughter)And Sudhir saysto be in the real world.Now, below that board of directors,of trying to take the Iowa franchise,which, it turned out, for this black gang,(Laughter)They are the entrepreneurs.These are the teenagers, typically,Extremely dangerous work.who are taking your order at McDonald's,at a place like McDonald's.It really is not fiction -- it's fact.you'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.If you managed to rise to the very top,Truly, you would be a great success story.this is what they were striving for.This was the best way out.to try to make it out this way.You look at this,The money looks about the same.Why is it such a bad job?a lot of the time.We found, in our gang --But there were costs.And so the death rate --You're in the gang for four years,That is about as high as you can get.So for comparison's purposes,Let's say that you were a murderertwo percent a year.(Laughter)So it's a lot safer being on death rowThat's extremely high.So in some very literal way,were living in a war zone,So why in the world, you might ask,selling drugs for $3.50 an hour,Why would they do that?And I think there are a couple answers.that the young people controlled the gang;So what happened was,became very, very wealthy.And so the logical thing to thinklike everybody else has,to the set of people we were looking at.They were willing to start at the bottom,is willing to start at the bottom,They never passed on any of the wealth,and it turned out to be a disaster.a whole roll of bills to hold.It wasn't his money -- until he spent it,and then he was in debt to the gang,So I have a couple minutes.from the study of the gang.worked very well in the drug economy,Here's an economic principle.called a "compensating differential."than people who work in parks.It's exactly this concept.Because they're not willing to be at risk.than the economist, about what's going on.(Laughter)Here's another one.Economists talk about game theory,people are afraid to go buy drugs there,But we gotta be careful,(Laughter)So that's the same concept.the gang leader always got paid.We had some theories related to cash flow,Then we asked the gang member,His response is,And I thought about it and said,(Laughter)Thank you very much.(Applause)

which is called "Blink,"(Laughter)But I was thinking about this,and I think would make my mother happy,it's not really about happiness.as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,Howard's about this high, and he's round,and thinning gray hair,And by profession, he's a psychophysicist.although at some point in my life,I dated a girl for two years(Laughter)And one of his first clients was Pepsi.And Pepsi came to Howard and they said,and we would like to make Diet Pepsi.We'd like you to figure outin order to have the perfect drink."and that's what Howard thought.Because Pepsi told him,all the way up to 12 --and we plot the results on a curve,Really simple.and he plots it on a curve,In fact, the data doesn't make any sense.It's a mess. It's all over the place.They think, "Well, you know,right in the middle.Howard is not so easily placated.And this was not good enough for him,and this question bedeviled him for years.they were asking the wrong question.They were looking for the perfect Pepsi,Trust me.This was an enormous revelation.Howard immediately went on the road,and he would stand up and say,You're wrong."What are you talking about? Craziness."And they would say, "Move! Next!"he was obsessed, though,Howard loves the Yiddish expressionThis was his horseradish.(Laughter)He was obsessed with it!And finally, he had a breakthrough.Vlasic Pickles came to him,And he said,And he came back to them and he said,you need to create zesty."And that's where we got zesty pickles.And this was even more important.Campbell's made Prego,or how much time I have to go into this.Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù.the spice mix is far superior;back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego.That's called "adherence."and the quality of their tomato paste,Prego was struggling.what you have is a dead tomato society.So he said, this is what I want to do.that you can vary tomato sauce:by sweetness, by level of garlic,by visible solids --(Laughter)he varied spaghetti sauce.and he went on the road.He went to New York, to Chicago,he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.And he sat them down for two hours,Ten small bowls of pasta,he had a mountain of dataAnd then he analyzed the data.And sure enough, if you sit down,because at the time, in the early 1980s,if you went to a supermarket,And Prego turned to Howard, and they said,crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauceand yet no one is servicing their needs?"And he said "Yes!"(Laughter)And Prego then went back,off their line of extra-chunky sauces.do you know how many Ragùs there are?36!In six varieties:Cheese, Light,Robusto, Rich &amp; Hearty,Old World Traditional --Extra-Chunky Garden.(Laughter)That's Howard's doing.Now why is that important?(Laughter)It is, in fact, enormously important.I'll explain to you why.about making you happy.And for years and years and years,Ragù and Prego would have focus groups,"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?And for all those years -- 20, 30 years --through all those focus group sessions,no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.(Laughter)People don't know what they want!As Howard loves to say,It's a mystery!(Laughter)And a critically important stepyou know what you'd say?Most of you like milky, weak coffee.(Laughter)that "I want a milky, weak coffee."it's another very critical point --he made us realize the importanceWhy is this critical?They were obsessed with mustard.What were they? Yellow mustard.What's in it?That was mustard.Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon.Right?much more delicate aromatics.And what do they do?made it look French,(Laughter)the way that French's and Gulden's did,they decided to charge four dollars.And they had those ads.Takes over the mustard business!And everyone's take-home lesson from thatwas that the way to make people happysomething to aspire to.(Laughter)Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy.There is no good mustard or bad mustard.(Laughter)What do I mean by that?(Laughter)For the longest time in the food industry,there was a sense that there was one way,a perfect way, to make a dish.You go to Chez Panisse,in a something something reduction.No!You just get the reduction. Why?Because the chef at Chez Panisse"This is the way it ought to be."and if you quarrel with her, she will say,"You know what? You're wrong!Italian tomato sauce is what?It's blended; it's thin.The culture of tomato sauce was thin.we talked about Italian tomato sauce,we talked about the earliest Ragùs,which had no visible solids, right?Which were thin, you just put a little bitThat's what it was.And why were we attached to that?then they would embrace it.In other words,with the idea of universals,because all of science,was obsessed with universals.that govern the way all of us behave.But that changed, right?to the understanding of variability.just how cancer works,and that is -- oh, I'm sorry.we aren't just making an error;And the example he used was coffee.and then I asked you to rate that coffee,maybe three or four coffee clusters,your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.of Howard Moskowitz:Thank you.(Applause)

Over the past couple of days,as I've been preparing for my speech,And --(Laughter)So I was getting pretty nervousand that's more nerve-racking.and my great-grandfather,and I realized(Laughter)that I had to consider this "my element."So, who am I?We have about 125 people internationally.If you looked in the book,you saw this ...(Laughter)which I really was appalled by.(Laughter)I made a graph that moves,and I talk about the makeup of me.(Laughter)So, besides this freakish thing,this is my science slide.(Laughter)So --where a blogger talked about how you hackand it spread all over.Kryptonite had to adjust the lock,You may have heard about Rathergate,which was basically the result of bloggersrealizing that the "th" in 111is not typeset on an old typewriter;it's on Word.Bloggers exposed this,or they worked hard to expose this.These people are reaching thousands,if not millions, of readers,and that's incredibly important.During the hurricane,updating it frequently.You have my friend,He makes enough money just by running ads,to support his family up in Oregon.That's all he does now,It's a wonderful organizationThis is wonderful.I am not that caring.(Laughter)I talk about myself.That's what I am. I'm a blogger.and I am an expert on this person,and so I write about it.So, the short story about my blog:it started in 2001, I was 23.I wasn't happy with my job,because I was a designer,but I wasn't being really stimulated.I was an English major in college.So, I started to write a blogand basically by the end,jumped off Bible Peak.You can laugh, this is OK.(Laughter)This is me.This is what happened to me.And I set a goal.I said, "I'm going to win an award,"And then I wrote a post about a banjo.I wrote a postabout wanting to buy a banjo --a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.And I don't play instruments;I don't know anything about music.I like music, and I like banjos,and I said, "I could do that."And I said to my husband,And my husband --(Laughter)this is my husband, who is very hot --he won an award for being hot.(Laughter)He told me,"You cannot buy a banjo.this person is so loving and so sweetthat he lets me dress him upand post pictures of him to my blog.(Laughter)he would kill me.But the thing was, my friends read it,But I got emails from people that said,Why don't you open a separate account?"They said, "Separate your bank account.And then I got people saying, "Leave him."(Laughter)And why are they reading this?"And I started to kill my blog slowly.Slowly and slowly --and she passed away two years ago.and gossip and all these things.These are out there,and this is who I am."Norman Rockwell is not art.to us as humans.These things resonate with us,and then you have this.His father was a blogger.And he was writing his blog one day,and his wife gave birth to her babyat 25 weeks.And he never expected this.And this is a one-pound baby.So Odin was documented every single day.day 39 -- he gets pneumonia.His baby is so small,and I've never encountered such a --And you're reading this as it happens,breathing failures and heart failures,And you see this post.but this is something this person feels,but 28 people matter.And today, he is a healthy baby,who, if you read his blog --it's snowdeal.org, his father's blog --So, blogs.throughout our online history.and that's where we are today.But then you also find people's blogs,because blogging software is simple.it's not rocket science.So --And we started with a slide of my Teds,and I had to add this slide,This is my mom.So, I have all the people that I know of.in terms of my direct line.looking at constantly.so does that first generation up there."And it's just these little things.and how we can trace our line.So that has always influenced me.I have this record, this 1910 census,if they spoke English,And it's pretty sad,that's why my husband's a saint --I spent time in the Washington archives,Now it's online, but he sat through that.And so you have this record and --This is my great-great-grandmother.This is the only picture I have.this is an amazing thing.or a series of photos, is this projectTwenty-nine years.You see all this math?because that's my skill set.(Laughter)So you have these people aging,and now this is them today, or last year.if I ever have children --what I am going to --who I was.I am a blogger --that is an amazing thing for me,every single day.And, you know, it's the same picture;it's basically the same person.Only a couple of people read it.I don't write this for this audience;About four people probably read it,and they tell me, "You haven't updated."and say, what was I doing this day?I look at it, I know exactly.I put the bad pictures up too,because there are bad pictures.(Laughter)I had to go for a one-day trip.I was sick, and I was in a hotel room,and I wanted not to be there.and it's a pretty disturbing thing,in all of what I'm doing.So, this woman, her name was Emma,you know, there was 100 people.we could keep track of everyone.And she was writing one day,and then she disappeared for a little bit.and it was a very hard day at the company.and flattening this sort of world.That this woman is in England,and she lives -- she lived -- a lifeher sister wrote to me, and she said --and she wrote on this blog --And that was amazing,That was an amazing thing.And that's a huge thing.So, this is her legacy,think about what you've thought of them,and then actually do it,So, thank you.(Applause)

So many different points of resonancebut I'll try to do my best.Does anybody remember these?(Laughter)And I think it was best witnessedor an ecosystem that's been createdthat, if you take some words from Apple,to create new music and musical ideas.use them in innovative ways.draw connections between musical ideas,a vibrant community that's very inclusive,I'm here to talk about books.that we use every day in school.Has anyone here ever been to school?(Laughter)around the world?That in fact, the publishing process --it's heavy, books are expensive --and the ultimate users of books,that we've seen in the musical cultureSo, that's what I'd like to talk aboutto where we need to go.Imagine taking all the world's books.So, liberating these pagesImagine making it free,and imagine using information technologyimagine them coming out every 25 seconds.So, really, this is the dream,and in a sense what you can think of itI mean anyone in the world --(Laughter)to be their own educational DJ,constantly innovating on them.So, this is the dream.Over the last six-and-a-half years,on a project called Connexions,is just tell you a little bitto Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday,We're working on the open-source toolsand the content.So, create.Well, the first thing is,from Cambridge to Kyoto,And not only that --If people like Kitty Jones, a shut-out --on how to teach kids how to play music --Tremendous use.for this kind of open, free content.A lot of teachers are using this stuff.And within about a week,People, volunteers and even companieslike Chinese, Japanese and Thai,to spread the knowledge even further.OK, what about people who are mixing?What does "mixing" mean?means building customized books.Companies like National Instruments,into the materials,to an experiencein 84 countries around the world.TWB is currently in Iraq,to a kind of cultural imperialism --that if you don't empower peopleit's not good.people know about UC Merced.They're actually developingcompletely open-source.in a whole range of different languages.of one of these courses.And I think a lot of you received --A little present for you.It's about 300 pages long, hardbound.This costs -- anybody guess?How much would it cost in a bookstore?(Audience) 65 dollars.Why does it cost 22 dollars?Because it's published on demandit would cost at least 122 dollars.So what we're seeingtowards community-authored materialseither pushed out through Amazonright at the left side.We're talking about booksto sustain open projects like ours,like QOOP, who produced these two books.OK, so what are the enablers?What's really making all of this happen?There's tons of technology,How many people know about XML?Oh, great.So it's the future of the web, right?It's semantic representation of content.Well, what the XML is going to doXML are the nubs on the LegoSo, it lets you take this ecosystemall the pages you've torn out of books,books, courses, course packs.to each individual student,and surprising new ways.It lets you interconnect ideas,And I'll just give you my personal story.because I teach the stuff in the red box.I teach signal processingjust looking at the equation.(Laughter)But this seemingly dry maththat links technology --to tremendous economic opportunities,And the thing that I realizedWe needed a community to do itis make Minsky's dream come to a reality,actually starting to talk to each other.OK, back to math.Imagine -- this is possible:You can click on every single equationtinker with it, understand it.Imagine chemistry textbooksImagine Music XMLplay with it, understand it.Even the three wise men.(Laughter)Because, in fact, I got up herebecause this music has been propertized.Things like Linux and the GPL.The Creative Commons licenses.If you have not, you must learn about it.Creativecommons.org.and in lots of other projects,you can find their logo.human-readable document, a deed,as long as you attribute the author.it's really this idea of sharing knowledgeand making impact.We're at the long tail end here.And Creative Commons is taking off --over 43 million things out there,licensed with a Creative Commons license.Not just text,but music, images, video.And there's actually a tremendous uptakeripping, mixing, burning and sharing.So, we've built this idea of a commons.People are using it.gets a similar number of hits.But how do we protect this?How do we protect it into the future?is quality control, right?Anybody can contribute anything.So that could be a problem.for example, on lingerie,which is actually a pretty good module.it points to a lingerie-selling website.So this is a little bit of a problem.You come to TED. Why do you come to TED?Because Chris and his team have ensuredand we call these things "lenses."And basically what they allowthat they think is really important.So I'd just like to end by saying:of education and educational publishing.So, thanks very much.

it should stop being safe.it was anything but radical:in which every single person on the planetAnd that's what we're doing.So Wikipedia --it's a freely licensed encyclopedia.It's written by thousands of volunteersIt's written using wiki software --so anyone can quickly edit and save,he's exactly describing Wikipedia.And what I'm going to do todaywhich I founded,a nonprofit organization.poverty worldwide,to make good decisions.that goes beyond just the Internet.you can copy it, redistribute it --all over the world.We're funded by donations from the public,But first, I'll show you how big it is.clusters to the English Wikipedia,which is surprising to a lot of people.but for us, we're truly global.We're in many, many languages.and this is the New York Times over there.And what's interesting about thisWe have exactly one employee,all the other growth before that ...All the editing is done by volunteers.And the way that we're organizedor "Who does that?"It's a very unusual and chaotic thing.and see eight to 10 people waiting for meYou could never affordand do what we're doing at Wikipedia.so it's really gotten to be a huge thing.And that's essentially our main cost.We could actually do without the employee.and full-time at Wikipedia,so we actually hired him,why isn't it all rubbish?Why is the website as good as it is?First of all, how good is it?Well, it's pretty good.It isn't perfect,given our completely chaotic model.But when we've seen quality tests --and there haven't been enough of these yetwe win hands down.which is much, much smaller than English,and we won across the board.and we were very pleased with that result.The reporters called me up and they --And so they quote me as saying,So it's a slight misquote.(Laughter)The articles were edited quite heavily.on a couple of occasions.Time magazine recently reported that"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken,occasionally a little bit here and there.are not really controversies at all.that's where most people assume --and the party of the jerks.And no side of the political spectrumis that the Bush-Kerry articleswhich happens sometimes even on stage ...(Laughter)That's not a good thing.So how do we do this?How do we manage the quality control?How does it work?So there's a few elements,is our neutral point of view policy.It's a social concept of cooperation,The reason for this is if we saySo we have very diverse contributorsBy having this firm neutrality policy,we ensure that people can work togetherSo, real-time peer review.which is an Internet chat channelAnd people can get RSS feeds --because it is sometimes vandalized.There's a "new pages feed," for example,and see every new page as it's created.This is really importantyou know, "ASDFASDF."some of the new articles.other people will find that intriguingSo we do have edits by anonymous users,of all the edits to the websiteare done by anonymous users.who are in constant communication.All these people know each other.The standards we set for ourselvestend to be pretty smart people.allow us, meaning the community --and see, "OK, I understand now."When somebody goes and looks at --made an edit to my page.Somebody looks at it --all of the changes that took place --So that's one tool that we can useis we leave everything very open-ended.All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.it needs to be deleted.is the Votes For Deletion page.it's a film, "Twisted Issues,"and the first person says,It's not a perfect rule,So the next persons says, "Clean it up."Now it is true that at the end of the day,then it would survive.Like I say, it's a tight-knit community.because he knows what he's doing.So how is all this governed?some amount of democracy --all of the administrators --to bias the content of the encyclopedia.There's a certain amount of aristocracy.than someone we don't know.I give this talk sometimes with Angela,to the Board of the Foundation,And I always embarrass her because I say,"Well, Angela, for example,because she's so admired and so powerful."And then there's monarchy,(Laughter)I was describing this in Berlin once,"I am the Queen of England."(Laughter)And that's not exactly what I said, but --(Laughter)the point is my role in the community --of the "benevolent dictator" model.they have one single person in chargecompiled by the world.It just isn't appropriate.a certain amount of --sometimes we have to make a decisionin formal decision-making processes.this Jewish conspiracy of a website,That's neo-Nazi math for you.to delete a perfectly valid article.I mean, this could happen.and comes in and wants to vote?"That's my job in the community:to undermine the quality of the content.then that's a valid place for me.Of course, because of the free licensing,I can't tell anyone what to do.but we are not fanatical web anarchists.is for the quality of the work,Thank you.(Applause)Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders.are inherently biased.And that turns out to not be true."Why do academics hate Wikipedia?"I sent it from my Harvard email address(Laughter)which is the Wikibooks project,And that's a much bigger project.But part of that is to fulfill our missionAnd for a lot of people in the world,there's all kinds of innovation going on.

(Laughter)I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends --Not just by learning principles,Often that's what people think I do,and it's the furthest thing from it.What happens, though, is people say to me,"I don't need any motivation."But that's not what I do.I'm the "why" guy.I want to know why you do what you do.What is your motive for action?Are you running the same pattern?is the most important thing.All of us here have great minds.Most of us here have great minds, right?We all know how to think.We can make anything happen.that people work in their self-interest.But we know that that's bullshit at times.because when emotion comes into it,What I would like to invite you to doOne: so that you can contribute more.because it's making us intersect.of "everybody now understands everybody,and everybody appreciates everybody."What in their performance?"I got hired to produce the result now.I've done it for 30 years.I get the phone calland they were ahead by five strokesand now they can't get back on the course.I've got to do something.How do you make a change?to do something beyond themselves.Maybe the real question is,How do you make your dreams happen?whatever, your body, your family.Because science is easy, right?You can only feel so much by yourself.how somebody's life changesLike all the resources they say they need.end up the rest of their lifegoing in and out of rehab.and not always, but often,What is it that shapes us?We live in a therapy culture.the mindset that we are our past.The past equals the future.Of course it does if you live there.and then not use it, not apply it.When you ask people,Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.What do they tell you?I didn't have the right manager.(Laughter)(Applause) (Cheering)(Applause continues)TR: And --(Applause)(Laughter)but that is not the defining factor.(Applause) (Laughter)And you correct me if I'm wrong.is if you have emotion, human emotion,Audience: Yeah!(Applause) (Cheering)(Laughter)Idiot, Robbins.to get this man's intellect and capacity.and I was upset.But there was emotion there.Do you know what I'm talking about?Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.TR: So, emotion is it.If you're creative, playful, fun enough,can you get through to anybody, yes or no?If you don't have the money,This is the ultimate resource.They tell us a bunch of different stories.if you take a look here,(Laughter)(Laughter)What determines your resources?What will you focus on?Consciously or unconsciously.and that meaning produces emotion.Is this the end or the beginning?So, think about your own life,have there been some decisionsAudience: Aye.I know the Google geniuses I saw here --Or someone standing in front of a tank."You've got testicular cancer."(Laughter)It wasn't the end; it was the beginning.of the three million I've been around.So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?We all have had times,(Laughter)It wasn't your ability; it was your state.It makes people make decisions.It's made up of three parts.It's not your desires.You can get your desires or goals.Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.then you find out what's your map,and at least be comfortable.Now, how do you get it?even though we need that --you won't listen to any speaker.What do you feel if you're certain?what would you feel?We need variety. We need surprise.Audience: Aye.So, variety is important.Who's done this? Get a fucking life.(Laughter)Why are you doing it?and there's variety.Third human need, critical: significance.Whatever it takes.The fastest way to do this,or resourcefulness, is violence.Zero to 10. How high? 10.How much uncertainty?all the way down there.Total variety and uncertainty.You can get significance a million ways,We all want it;And you're going to get hurt again.Here's what's true: we need it.through walking in nature.when you come back 5 minutes later.The last two are the needs of the spirit.And this is where fulfillment comes.You won't get it from the first four.But number five, you must grow.We all know the answer.If you don't grow, you're what?if you're not growing,how many love you,you feel like hell.And I believe the reason we growis so we have something to give of value.Because we all know, corny as that sounds,the secret to living is giving.It's exciting.the most exciting thing is:And that calling can touch other people.Thanksgiving, no money, no food,we were not going to starve,but my father was totally messed up,His focus was "This is charity.What does it mean? I'm worthless.(Laughter)And now somebody I don't know,looking out for us.And that made me decide,Next year, I did four, then eight.So I went out, got my friends involved,18 years later,through our foundation.in different countries around the world.(Applause)Thank you.because they get excited to contributeSo, finally -- I'm about out of time.The target that shapes you --Here's what's different about people.We have the same needs.or uncertainty?Are you driven by significance or love?We all need all six,The second piece is the map.and some people's map is,and they're a fireman,But they have a different map.The last piece is emotion.One of the parts of the map is like time.If you've got a target and a map --I can't use Google because I love Macs,So if you use MapQuest --(Laughter)The last thing is emotion.Here's what I'll tell you about emotion.There are 6,000 emotionsBut if your dominant emotions --If I have 20,000 people or 1,000in an average week,and I give them as long as they need,the other's disempowering,They have six good feelings.Happy, happy, excited, oh shit,How many of you know somebody(Laughter)How many of you know somebody like this?I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,and at the end, I stopped.And all of a sudden, I said,And I went through this whole thingThat night is when 9/11 happened.She said, "It's over."It was stupid of me."because I'm going to die."She was on Larry King later.And he said, "You're probably wonderingDon't let anything ever stop you.""I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.but frankly, this is retribution."(Laughter)Are you sure?(Laughter)10 seconds!(Laughter and applause)10 seconds, I want to be respectful.All I can tell you is,I brought this man on stagebecause I had about 200 New Yorkers there.marking off their Palm Pilots.30 friends crossing off that all died.And I got the group to focus on:if you didn't lose somebody today,doesn't know anybody here.I asked, "Do you always get angry?"She said, "Yes."and this man who wanted to be a terrorist,and I made it very clear.instead of my verbalization,but the two of them not only came togetherthrough various mosques and synagogues,the idea of how to create peace.So, transformation can happen.My invitation to you is:explore your web,the web in here --for two reasons:but I mean give,And secondly, so you can appreciate --(Applause)

Good.(Laughter)But, besides being a black woman,My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam,Jesus.These things make me different from you.But the things we have in commonand I am in between these two worldsSo how did things get so different for us?and a few years later, he married my mom.My dad was not alone.and in many cities around the country.In New York State,before their buildings were razed.600,000 people were displaced.The common perception wasthat it's bad and ugly,how could it not reflect on you?Now, why is this story important?Because from a planning perspective,which begets social degradation.And who pays? Who profits?This was "planning" -- in quotes --That small park I told you about earlierwith dedicated on-street bike paths.as well as local economic development.Think bike shops, juice stands.This is Lafayette Avenue --for these well-paying jobs.in their environment.of the Robert Moses era,on top of our offices.Green roofs are soil and living plants.and degrade under the sun,which we in turn breathe.which, incidentally, are often located[Butterfly](Laughter)So cool![Green is the new black ...](Laughter) (Applause)I like that, too.but since I have all of your attention:We need investors.
