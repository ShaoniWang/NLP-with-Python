I want to start by doing an experiment.and instead of the sound of rain,I've added the sound of bacon frying.(Rain falls)(Rain falls)(Rain falls)All right.Actually, I lied.They're all bacon.(Bacon sizzles)(Applause)every time you see a rainy scene,We're not looking for accuracy.So on the subject of deception,and telling beautiful, untrue things.So when you're watching a movieand a phone rings,it's not actually ringing.All of the sounds you hear are fake.Everything, apart from the dialogue,is fake.(Wings flap)They haven't really recorded the bird.or shaking kitchen gloves.(Flaps)The burning of a cigarette up close --(Cigarette burns)It actually sounds a lot more authenticif you take a small Saran Wrap balland release it.(A Saran Warp ball being released)Punches?(Punch)Oops, let me play that again.(Punch)usually cabbage.(Cabbage stabbed with a knife)The next one -- it's breaking bones.(Bones break)Well, no one was really harmed.It's actually ...breaking celery or frozen lettuce.(Breaking frozen lettuce or celery)(Laughter)as a trip to the supermarketand going to the vegetable section.So let's reverse-engineer togetherthe creation of a sound effect.He's a contributor to our library,for "The Hunt for Red October."In this Cold War classic, in the '90s,So they had a small problem:So basically, what they did is,they went to a friend's swimming pool,They placed an underwater mic(Underwater plunge)Adding the overhead mic,it sounded a bit like this:(Water splashes)sort of like slowing down a record.(Water splashes at lower octave)(Water splashes)And pitched it down another octave.(Water splashes at lower octave)from the overhead microphone.(Water splashes)And by looping and repeating that sound,they got this:(Propeller churns)that we're inside the submarine.But once you've created your soundsand you've synced them to the image,after the original sound has ended.So it's sort of like the --all the reflections from the materials,Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot.(Gunshot)By adding reverb,(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom)(Gunshot reverbs church)Or in a canyon.(Gunshot reverbs in canyon)So reverb gives us a lot of informationIf the sound is the taste,But reverb can do a lot more.than the on-screen actionis going to immediately signify to usthat we're listening to a commentator,are often heard with zero reverb,On the completely other side,adding a lot of reverb to a voiceOr, even more powerful in film,Morgan Freeman.(Laughter)So --(Applause)But what are some other tools or hacksthat sound designers use?Well, here's a really big one.It's silence.And in the Western world,we're not really used to verbal silences.They're considered awkward or rude.So silence preceding verbal communicationcan create a lot of tension.But imagine a really big Hollywood movie,So in a yin-yang way,for either of them to have any effect.But what does silence mean?or provoke thought.We often relate silences with ...contemplation,meditation,being deep in thought.But apart from having one meaning,silence becomes a blank canvasand zero external sounds,because of the sound of the projector.And even in today's Dolby world,There's always some sort of noise.Ambiences are the unique background soundsthat are specific to each location.Each location has a unique sound,and each room has a unique sound,which is called room tone.(Voices, music)(Traffic sounds, car horns, voices)the ventilation, the heating, the fridge.Ambiences work in a most primal way.perhaps because, as a species,(Birds chirp)a little more recently.and his sound designer, Alan Splet --(Machine noises)Occasionally, they can be so significantthat they become a character in a movie.(Thunder)or perhaps our own mortality.(Bells ring)or a friendship.(Glass breaks)Scientists believe that dissonant sounds,may remind us of animal howls in nature(Brass and wind instruments play)That's what we call offscreen sounds,or "acousmatic."Acousmatic sounds --not revealing himself to his disciples.in that way,and his words and its meaning,rather than the visual of him speaking.So sort of like the Wizard of Oz,or "1984's" Big Brother,separating the voice from its source,separating cause and effectand therefore, authority.up in galleries close to the ceiling,you create a sense of mystery.Hearing a sound without knowing its sourceis going to create some sort of tension.I wanted to play a little video.(Toy squeaks)(Typewriter)(Drums)(Ping-pong)(Knives being sharpened)(Record scratches)(Saw cuts)(Woman screams)is that sound is a language.it can change the mood;it can set the pace;a few years ago,to sound designers,filmmakers,and video game and app designers,to keep telling even better storiesand creating even more beautiful lies.So thanks for listening.(Applause)

(Music)(Applause)that is not what it looked like.(Laughter)when the big TV ballroom revival hit,and this was incredible.I mean, one day we would say "foxtrot,"and people were like "Foxes trotting."(Laughter)And the next day they were telling usthe finer points of a good feather step.And this blew our minds.and why tango traveled unlike the waltz,and it changed everything.But running parallel to this excitement,(Laughter)there was also this reservation.Why this and why now?or just for fun,we'd toss each other around, mix it up,while we were dancing,as a way of taking turns and playing fair.in a small festivalpulled us aside after the show and said,(Laughter)and what's worse,being defined by that single role.TC: Because, of course,it's a way of thinking, of being,of relating to each otherthat captured a whole period's values.the man leadsand the woman follows.he leads, she follows.So this was gender training.You weren't just learning to dance --you were learning to "man" and to "woman."It's a relic.This isn't the present.But know that this is history.This doesn't represent how we think today.So we asked ourselves:If you strip it all down,what is at the core of partner dancing?(Laughter)So if we were to update the existing form,of how we interact here, now, in 2015.Watch what's not.Together.Only.Ever.and in many cases,the rules prohibit them completely.and then look for an actual Latino person.(Laughter)You'll be there for days.spray-tanned to the point of mahogany.(Laughter)no mixed-race couples,she can't be taller,he can't be shorter.She can't be bolder,he can't be gentler.If you were to take a ballroom danceand translate that into a conversationand drop that into a movie,He dictates, she reacts.and yet somehow,and we, as a culture,tune in and clap.We are applauding our own absence.(Music)(Applause)(Laughter)And you thought it looked ...a little strange.Interesting -- appealing, even --but a little bit odd.it just doesn't quite seem to fit.Aesthetically speaking,this is considered beautiful.(Laughter)But why not this?(Laughter)and the follower smaller and feminine --this is a stumbling point.and then switch?And then switch back?What if it could be like a conversation,What if we could dance like that?We call it "Liquid Lead Dancing."JF: Let's try this with a Latin dance,salsa.so here it is.One more time for the cheap seats.(Laughter)And here's the action one more time,nice and slow.the cross-body lead becomes a pointwhere the lead and the follow can switch.Here's how that looks in slow motion.to a negotiation.Anyone can lead. Anyone can follow.Because, of course,it isn't just a system of switching leads;it's a way of thinkingSo: the waltz.The waltz is a turning dance.This means that for the lead,completely blind.And because of the follower's position,(Laughter)So you're out here on the floor,and then imagine that coming right at you.JF: Raaaaaah!(Laughter)a switch of posture for a moment?A lot of accidents could be avoided.it would be a lot safer,(Laughter)on stages in North America and in Europe.And it never fails to engage.it always evokes and engages.But why?as "political."We were still us.And that's where the true freedom lies --not just the freedom to switch roles,Be a masculine followor a feminine lead.Just be yourself.and we love it.We invented Liquid Leadthe fine art of taking care of each other.(Music)(Applause)

This is the Bop.The Bop is a type of social dance.Dance is a language,It can't be traced to any one moment.Because of that,social dances bubble up,they changeand they spread like wildfire.They are as old as our remembered history.In African-American social dances,we see over 200 yearsThe present always contains the past.And the past shapes who we areand who we will be.(Clapping)on the plantation.Brought to the Americas,stripped of a common spoken language,It may have looked something like this.Slapping thighs,shuffling feetand patting hands:improvising complex rhythmsand retaining a sense of inner freedomunder captivity.the Cakewalk,The crazy thing about this danceNow you might recognize this one.1920s --the Charleston.making its way into Lindy Hop,swing dancingand even the Kid n Play,originally called the Funky Charleston.the Charleston permeated dance hallsand move their legs.if you knew the steps,it meant you belonged to a group.But what if it becomes a worldwide craze?Enter the Twist.brought to America from the Congoduring slavery.But in the late '50s,right before the Civil Rights Movement,Suddenly, everybody's doing the Twist:white teenagers,kids in Latin America,making its way into songs and movies.Through social dance,The story continues in the 1980s and '90s.Along with the emergence of hip-hop,borrowing from its long past,shaping culture and being shaped by it.Why do we dance?To move,to let loose,to express.Why do we dance together?To heal,to remember,to say: "We speak a common language.We existand we are free."

Why bother?The game is rigged.My vote won't count.The choices are terrible.Voting is for suckers.Perhaps you've even said them.And our choices indeed are often terrible.and find plenty to be uninspired about.And crazy as it may sound,I believe we can revive the joy of voting.(Laughter)the United States had a vibrant,parades and bonfires.helped fuel this culture of voting.new African-American citizens,began to exercise their power,they celebrated in jubilee paradesA few decades later, the suffragettesAnd the Civil Rights Movement,that had been betrayed by Jim Crow,put voting right at the center.From Freedom Summer to the march in Selma,is key to actually claiming power.and in the decades since,this face-to-face culture of votinghas just about disappeared.It's been killed by televisionand then the internet.The couch has replaced the commons.that's a rather quiet kind of citizenship.What we need todayin person,in loud and passionate ways,voting can feel more like "join the club"or, better yet, "join the party."in local places but nationwide,to engage and electioneer:and praised in broad satirical style;soapbox speeches by citizens;public debates held inside pubs;than, say, Broadway's "Hamilton,"which is to say vibrantly contemporary.And the fact is that all around the world,eye-popping, eye-grabbing spectacleto the street theater of elections.And I would tell youYou might ask, who has the motivation?And I'll tell you,any citizen who wants to be seen and heardnot as a prop, not as a talking point,but as a participant, as a creator.Well, how do we make this happen?Simply by making it happen.That's why a group of colleagues and IIn four cities across the United States --Philadelphia, Miami,Akron, Ohio, and Wichita, Kansas --to come together and create projectsIn Akron, it means political playsIn Philadelphia,in the North End to get out the vote.There are 20 of these projects,and they are changing people.Let me tell you about a couple of them.In Miami, we've commissioned and artist,a young artist named Atomico,But the thing is, Atomico had never voted.He wasn't even registered.He got himself registered,and woven into a performance.They got dozens of submissions.One of them was a poemwritten by nine students in an ESL class,all of them Hispanic migrant workersfrom nearby Hartville, Ohio.I want to read to you from this poem.It's called "The Joy of Voting.""I would like to vote for the first timebecause things are changing for Hispanics.I used to be afraid of ghosts.Now I am afraid of people.There's more violence and racism.Voting can change this.The border wall is nothing.It's just a wall.The wall of shame is something.It's very important to voteso we can break down this wall of shame.I have passion in my heart.Voting gives me a voice and power.I can stand up and do something."It's about this passion.It's about feeling and belief,and it isn't just our organization's work.All across this country right now,around elections,people of every political background.What they have in common is simply this:their work is rooted in place.But when politics is about usWhich brings me back to where I began.Why bother?There's one way to answer this question.When we vote, even if it is in anger,Both of them bring the imagination to lifeare imagined, and can be reimagined.This moment right now,is so fundamentally important,and our ability to take that spiritand to take that sensethat there is something greater out there,It is a matter of spirit.Why bother voting?Not voting is voting,Not voting can be dressed upbut in fact not votingis actively handing power overNot voting is for suckers.Imagine where this country would bevoting is too complicated.They showed up,in American politics.They did that by voting.We live in a time right now,divided, often very dark,Well, here's the thing:In the 2012 presidential election,young voters, Latino voters,Asian-American voters, low-income voters,all showed up at less than 50 percent.which was a 70-year low.And in your average local election,I invite you to imagine 100 percent.Picture 100 percent.Mobilize 100 percent,and overnight, we get revolution.to all the people.all across the country right nowto make voting harder.But at the same time,that people want to belong to,be part of, and experience together.We have to make purpose.We have to make joy.So yes, let's have that revolution,a revolution of spirit, of ideas,of policy and participation,a revolution against cynicism,Let's vote this revolution into existence,and while we're at it,let's have some fun.Thank you very much.(Applause)

I spend most of my timethinking about little girls,She is smart and funnyand kind to people and a good friend.is "athlete."My kid's athletic.She is strong and fastin Shaolin Kempo.My daughter is athletic.and says his daughter is athletic,It is not.(Laughter)and I played "Dungeons and Dragons."And that is why,although my daughter is an athlete,she's also a huge nerd, which I love.that she made herself.She sits on the Iron Throne --(Laughter)She's a huge comic book fan.She loves Groot.She adores The Incredible Hulk.But my daughter really at heart,her thing is Star Wars.My kid is a Jedi.Although some days she's also a Sith,which is a choice that I can respect.(Laughter)whether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk,whether it's Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Maul,And where are all the female superheroes?And that is not actually the question,she's learning stuffas a professor of media studies,we refer to as public pedagogy.and about the world.outside of your basic bodily functionsis in some way touched by media.to the clothes that you wearall of that is in some way mediated.So the answer in our societyis largely through media.Well, there's a wrinkle in that,in that our society,They also exist as corporate entities.there's a problem.How big of a problem?Well think about this:It's a lot of different worldviews.In 2015, that number has shrunk to six,six companies.nine out of every 10 books.So my question to you is,Because in media studies,and they can't; they're terrible at that.But that's not their job.Media don't tell us what to think.Media tell us what to think about.They control the conversation,and in controlling the conversation,They control the conversation.How does this work in practice?Let's just take one of those companies.We'll do an easy one.Look around. Exactly.in our society.so it's an easy one for me to use.It's made a huge chunk of its money.as my daughter is, is this one.See, in 2012,and not Princess Leia.for these princesses.and when people went to Disney and said,Disney said, "We have no intentionwith the hashtag #WeWantLeia.What we meant was,And that was in 2012, and it is 2015,and look for Princess Leia merchandise,when they bought Marvel in 2009for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars.The Incredible Hulk,and they had access evenOne of the characters is a talking tree.It should not work.She's played by Zoe Saldana,and my daughter fell in love with her.If I wanted to buy her a Gamora backpack,well, Gamora's not on it.(Laughter)and if I wanted to buy her a t-shirt,she wasn't on it.And as a matter of fact,if I went to the store, as I did,and looked at the display,Gamora is not on any of it.and we were very excited,Scarlet Witch and Black Widow.And we were very excited.But here's the real thing about this.Even though Scarlett Johansson,and Black Widow is the starNot one.You will find Iron Man and Thor.You will even find War Machine,Who you will not find is Black Widow.# WheresNatasha.But I'm tired of doing that.I'm tired of having to do that.All over the country right now,and it's really awesome.You know how awesome it is?it was Black Widow that did it.Not only has she been erased,And so what is this teaching us?I mean, over the next five years,with comic book characters,and of those 30 feature-length films,Two.they will be members of teams.They will not be the main character.And if what we learn, what we knowall four of which are true of her,it doesn't matter.She will either be ignored like Gamoraor erased and replaced with a boylike Black Widow.And it's not fair.But here's the thing:they're not really yours,for having a little tomboy in her?Zero. None.People will think it's cute.adding so-called male traits to girlsis seen as an upgrade, seen as a bonus.I'm not raising a little boy, like Mike.but there are millions of boysand grown menThey have a club.They call themselves Bronies,pony bros, guys who like ponies.I happen to be one of them.And what are Mike and myselfsissified world of "My Little Pony?"and to look good and to feel goodand to do good,and they make fun of him,and at 11 years old, Mike goes home,finds a belt, wraps it around his neck,Because we have developed a societyWe have failed him.We have failed our children.And we have to do better for them.We have to stop.Because just this year, Target announcedThey were going to mix it up.just this week they released a shirtwas released on a t-shirtJust this week also,which I say, "Thank you, Disney,Just this week, Mattel, who makes Barbie,And the funny thing is,they met with girlsand you can see, they have calvesAnd please buy them.buy them for your sons.As a matter of fact, what I would lovegoes with a little flowchart in their head(Laughter)If the answer is yes,then that is not a toy for children.(Laughter)And if the answer is no,then it's for boys and girls.It's really simple.boys and girls are equally respected,Thank you.(Applause)

as a speciesis our lack of body hair --that our hairlessness, our nakednesscombined with our invention of clothing,And it's more than just utility,now it's a communication.a story about where we've been,what we're doing,who we want to be.I was a lonely kid.I made a lot of my own toys.It began with ice cream.There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown,and if you asked they would give you one.but I did, and they did.metal ring, top and bottom.my head actually fits inside this thing."(Laughter)Yeah, I cut a hole out,I put some acetate in thereand I made myself a space helmet.(Laughter)I needed a place to wear the space helmet,I pushed it home,and in my parents' guest room closet,I turned it into a spaceship.I cut a hole for a radar screenand put a star field,and I went on some space missions.A couple years later,the movie "Jaws" came out.like everyone else in America at the time.because a couple days before Halloween,Now, I recognize it's a bit of a tropefor people of a certain age to complainbut let me just show you a random sampling(Laughter)This is a paper-thin shark face(Laughter)And I loved it.A couple years later,I actually got him to take me to it twice,that made me want to go see it again.They helped --(Laughter)It was the armor.(Laughter)I was like, "Are they reading my mind?I want to wear armor all the time!"(Laughter)So I went back to my favorite material,the gateway drug for making,corrugated cardboard,and I made myself a suit of armor,Now that I've oversold it,here's a picture of the armor that I made.(Laughter)(Applause)inspired by "Excalibur."A couple of years later,Over about a month,POP rivets.We carefully, over that month,with compound curves.Now, this is the one thing in this talkthat I don't have a slide to show you,because no photo exists of this armor.I did wear it to school,There were things I didn't anticipateand I'm standing in the back of class(Laughter)and disappear down this long tunnel,and then I woke up in the nurse's office.I had passed out from heat exhaustion,wearing the armor.And when I woke up,OK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years,called "MythBusters."And over 14 years,I also learn early onI use costumes to add humor, comedy, colorand I learn a little bit moreIn the episode "Dumpster Diving,"the question we were trying to answer is:Is jumping into a dumpster as safeas the movies would lead you to believe?(Laughter)into an air bag.and I thought,That's for the training."(Laughter)So I went to Haight Street.I found a long, flowing coat on eBay.The day of the experiment shoot comes up,and I step out of my car in this costume,and my crew takes a look at me ...I feel total embarrassment(Laughter)But the producer in my mind reminds myselfthat in the high-speed shot in slow-mo,(Laughter)Five years into the "MythBusters" run,People fly in from all over the worldAnd I wanted to participate.that covered me completely,The costume I chose?Hellboy.That's not my costume,that's actually Hellboy.(Laughter)But I spent monthsfrom the boots to the belt to the pantsto the right hand of doom.and I put them on.I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con(Laughter)Sweating! I should've remembered this.(Laughter)It's not called costuming at Cons,it's called "cosplay."and especially anime,but it is so much more than that.they mash them up.They bend them to their will.They're super clever and genius.(Laughter)But more than that,they rehearse their costumes.At Comic-Con or any other Con,You go up and say,They've worked hard on their poseAnd it's so beautiful to watch.And I take this to heart.At subsequent Cons,and I actually frighten some children.I learned that "hrr hrr hrr" --that head laugh that Chewbacca does.first of all, you're welcome.(Laughter)in an abandoned Japanese theme park.And she finds her way back out againa captured dragon named Hakuand a lonely demon named No-Face.and producing gold in his hand.But this doesn't go very well,until Chihiro saves him,rescues him.So I put together a No-Face costume,and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.When people asked to take my picture,I would nodand I would shyly stand next to them.They would take the picturea chocolate gold coin.Ah, ah ah! -- like that.And people were freaking out.And about 15 minutes in something happens.Somebody grabs my hand,and they put a coin back into it.I don't know why.And then it happens again.I can see through the mouth --I can see people's shoes.I want to know what's going on.And then it hits me:it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face.In the film "Spirited Away,"We are, all of us on that floor,And we're making it our own.to each other.Thank you.(Applause)

When I was a kid,I experienced something so powerful,and in all the wrong places.What I experienced wasn't virtual reality.It was music.And this is where the story begins.That's me,listening to the Beatles' "White Album."And the look on my face is the feelingthat I've been searching for ever since.Music goes straight to the emotional vein,into your bloodstreamand right into your heart.It deepens every experience.Fellas?(Music)This is the amazing McKenzie Stubbertand Joshua Roman.Music --(Applause)Yeah.Let's see how it does for this talk.on a cellular level.When I hear that one songfrom that one summerwith that one girl,Hey, Stacey.So I got into directing music videos.This is what they looked like.That's my brother, Jeff.Sorry about this, Jeff.(Laughter)Here's me, just so we're even.Incredible moves.Should've been a dancer.(Laughter)These experiments grew,to capture that lightning in a bottle.Except, I'm not.but never quite equated the powerthat just raw music had for me on its own.and your interactive dreamsin "3 Dreams of Black."We were pushing beyond the screen,trying to connect more deeplyto people's hearts and imaginations.But it wasn't quite enough.So I started chasing a new technologyAnd when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.I could taste the lightning.It was called virtual reality.This is what it looks like now.in the history of mediums.In fact, it's going to be the last one.of an experience,to our experiencing it firsthand.(Laughter)If we go back to the origins of mediums,by all best guesses,Our clan leader is telling usWe hear his wordsThe same thing happensthe book about the mammoth hunt,the play,the radio broadcast,the television showor the movie.into our reality.Virtual reality bridges that gap.Or you are the clan leader.Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth.(Laughter)So here's what special about VR.In all other mediums,your consciousness interprets the medium.In VR, your consciousness is the medium.So the potential for VR is enormous.But where are we now?What is the current state of the art?Well,we are here.This is the Lumière Brothers filmand into the storytelling.It took this medium decadesin the form of a feature film.In VR today, we're more learning grammarthan writing language.and we've learned a few things.your emotions, even your body.So let me show you some things.For the purpose of this demo,and stretch it into this giant rectangle.OK, here we go.Done wrong, it can actually make you sick.you can actually get away with it, though.The first day in film school,before you can break one.We have not learned every single rule.We've barely learned any at all,but we're already trying to break themof moving up off the ground.In VR, I can give that to you.(Music)It guides us how to feel.and our friend, JR,we take you up in a helicopter,you don't feel afraid.You feel triumphant for JR's character.The music guides you there.(Music)Contrary to popular belief,there is composition in virtual reality,where you have a rectangular frame.and how the world moves around you.is called "spatialized sound."even behind you,it might be Bono.(Laughter)We started in caves,and now we're all global citizens.about the things that are local to us.That's why it works as an empathy machine.it's now a story about us here.But where do we go from here?the format is fixed at its birth.Film has been a sequence of rectangles,from Muybridge and his horses to now.The format has never changed.But VR as a format, as a medium,isn't complete yet.but only two right now.And we call it virtual reality right now,What do we call it then?I could let you live inside that dream?or create galaxies from scratch,but using our raw thoughts?That's not a virtual reality anymore.But I hope you see where we're going.So let's experience it.Let's open the flap.For the people watching at home,we're going to put up a card right nowWe played in cardboard boxes as kids,by sticking our head in one again.You're about to participatewe're all going to watch somethingat the exact same time, together.Let's hope it works.Audience: ...15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9,8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1(Birds singing)(Train engine)Audience: (Shreiks)(Video) JR: Let me tell you"Walking New York."And when I was perfectly above --then I kept shooting.(Video) Woman's voice: Dear Lord,protect us from evil,for you are the Lord,the light.You who gave us life took it away.Let your will be done.Help us to live again.(Music)(Video) (Children's voices)Sometimes I thinkwe are the ones in charge.Chris Milk: How was it?(Applause)(Applause)what you just experienced.not as a tech platformbut as a humanity platform.And to that end, in November of last year,A lot of people got themLook familiar?Music led me on a pathfor a very long time.in their childhoodthat I had in mine.Only I think this onesurpasses it.Let's seewhere thisleads them.Thank you.(Applause)

I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female,like all of you.And I'm also a social justice comedian,something that I insist is an actual job.I've performed all over the country.It's got breathtaking nature,waffle housesand diabetes as far as the eye can see.It is really something.into three main categories:there's mostly wonderful people,hatersand Florida.(Laughter)They are a minority,and yes, some of the men do wear heels.As a social justice comedian,it's my goal to convert these haters,like racism, violence and Ted Nugent.This is not an exhaustive list;I'm probably missing 3-7 items.But the point is,we have to reckon with the haters.But there's variance within this groupI basically took all of the haters,and this is what I found.(Laughter)First off, we have the trolls.They're the people who quit their jobsThere's also the drive-by haters.Now, these people will be at a stoplight,they'll wait for the light to turn greenand hated you to your face.(Laughter)The next categorygives-them-cover-for-hating hater.like a church or a nonprofit,they just can't decide!They're like ideological slutswho move from hating to not hating.Why comedy?Because on a scale of comedy to brochure,(Laughter)Comedy is very popular.And by the way,this is a mathematically accurate graph,generated from fake numbers.(Laughter)Now, the question is:Why does social justice comedy work?Because, first off, it makes you laugh.And in that moment of openness,and if they're really skilled,a rectal exam.(Laughter)first off, it's not partisan.and no one is against justice.Two, it's inviting and warm,Three, it's funny but sneaky,on income inequality,(Laughter)in a non-violent way --(Laughter)And we went around the countryplaces where they love the Muzzies --and we did stand-up shows.(Laughter)We turned this into a movie,and then after the movie came out,a known hate group spent 300,000 dollarson an anti-Muslim poster campaignNow, the posters were truly offensive,not to mentioned poorly designed --I mean, if you're going to be bigoted,you might as well use a better font.(Laughter)that says nice things about Muslims,while promoting the movie.got the posters approved,the MTA decided to ban the posters,citing political content.Here's one.Facts about Muslims:OK.(Laughter)Fact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake.(Laughter)Let's take a look at another one.The ugly truth about Muslims:they have great frittata recipes.was considered political -- but it isn't.It's about justice.So we decided to change(Laughter)took on a major New York City agencyand the comedians won.(Applause and cheers)Thank you.Victory was a very weird feeling.'Cause this is amazing!"(Laughter)Here's another example.We do. But OK, I'll take the bait.while taking the weekends off.Let's take a look at an example.while recognizing that it's ridiculousBut if bigotry isn't your thing,in these offshore tax havens.Not to brag,but at the end of every month,with eight dollars and 27 cents.(Laughter)Most of my work is meant to be fun.Sometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail.But despite the occasional danger,like war and competitive ice dancing.Thank you.(Applause)

Do I look real to you?Hope so.I have no idea if you're seeing this,Right now I'm standingin the open air,on a beach under a palm tree,I have 12 minutes with you.I set a limit.My wife Navid once saidBut we only had three days to make it,and the only fabric we hadBut she did it, and it's perfect.And she looked at it and said,So with these 12 minutes,as I know it is so many of yours.I am 318 years old.And I've never questioned that someday,But the opposite keeps happening:the less we want to die.Who can blame us?The universe is so big.There won't ever not be more to see.Just yesterday,and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter.who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean.and there never has been,that no foot has ever touched before.You could spend 400 years doing just that.They're connected like nerve clusters:And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility.That's where Navid and I met.We were both artists downtown.and we bumped shoulders.And I turned to apologizeBut second, the question annoyed me,because the answer is so simple.I said, "We didn't pass through each otherbecause elementary particles have massand we've known that for 800 years."She must have been in one of those moodswhere she likes to mess with strangers.Or maybe she was just flirting with me,Think deeper."And then she took off her belt,this belt that I'm wearing now,and she said,Without that basic constraint,and never even known."And that's how our romance began.Navid and Inever ran out of things to talk about.Never.It was incredible.and we kept arriving at new vistas,would come out of us to describe them.and a little more water,and folding it in and turning it overand never getting around to baking it.She had a genius for it.All of her work revolved around it.My body was like a canvas for her,that I couldn't feel it moving.And she was obsessed with the exact momentI'd say, "I don't know!"but the answer I remember today is,"It feels goodand we are its art."versus what it turns out to be.and wake up in the future.And they did -- but then they died.and extend life for hundreds of years.And they did,but eventually, they died anyway.So when Navid started to show the signs,failure to keep living.More than anything,They kept referring to it as "declining,"the changes it was going through,I did send Navid to Earth.But I came with her."I just think it's arrogant,But I did.So, even here on Earth,I kept working on how to extend life.It didn't occur to methat there could be any other response.that day in Azadi Square,that without that basic constraint --a universe that granted mass to matter --we would not exist.That's one rule.I know. I tried everything.and replaying them on closed loop.Nothing worked.here but not here.When I realized I'd done it,I ran to her room,so happy to tell her I'd done it,even to my own,and went to lie down next to her,and forgot, and fell right through her.I'd found a way to eternal life,which was to touch and be touched.And she threw me out.I still got to watch, though.Humans live 400 years now,and we still die.And when death comes,the dying still pick at their bedsheets,like they're falling asleep.I've always thought thatwhat gives a life meaning is adventure.And death is just a problemwe haven't discovered the solution to yet.Maybe that's the paradox:(Sighs)There is another forecast for tonight,but for now the sky is clear.I can't feel the wind here,An answer worthy of my wife.I have to find my way back to the flesh.

When I was seven years old,Proudly, I said: "An artist.""No, you don't," he said,"You can't make a living being an artist!"But I gathered myself,went off in search of a new dream,eventually settling on being a scientist,(Laughter)I have always loved math and science,later, coding.In my junior year,fireworks going off in my head,and stories I connected with,was pure magic for me.Just two years later, I started workingTo create our movies,that creates characters,I was fascinated by all of it.But then I got my first taste of lighting.Here you can see I've added a light,turn on shadowsand placing the light.As I place a light,So it might look like this at first,but as we adjust this and move thatin weeks of work,in rough form it might look like this,and in final form, like this.It's where we go from thisto this.and suddenly the world comes to lifeas if it's an actual place that exists.This moment never gets old,As I learned to light,to set the time of day,to create the mood,to guide the audience's eye,how to make a character look appealingor stand out in a busy set.Did you see WALL-E?(Laughter)There he is.As you can see,We can make a world with monsters,with robots that fall in love,we can even make pigs fly.(Laughter)While this is an incredible thing,this untethered artistic freedom,it can create chaos.It can create unbelievable worlds,unbelievable movement,things that are jarring to the audience.We use science and the world we knowas a backbone,But how do you make it look underwater?In early research and development,Then we broke it back downOne of the most critical elementsfirst, the visibility of the water,and then what happens with the color.As light travels deeper into the water,we lose the red wavelengths,then the green wavelengths,leaving us with blue at the far depths.The first is the surge and swell,or the invisible underwater currentThe second is the caustics.These are the ribbons of light,Here we have the fog beams.These give us color depth cues,but also tells which direction is upit appears and disappears,You can see how we're using the science --to tether that artistic freedom.But we are not beholden to it.We considered each of these elementsto suit the sad mood of what's happening.So we pushed the visibility of the waterBecause in the end,we're trying to create a believable world,He finds beauty in the simplest things.(Laughter)to sell his acting and emotions.We started lighting and we realizedHe was starting to look glassy-eyed.(Laughter)but solve this reflection problem.So we started with the lenses.Here's the flat-front lens,we have a concave lensand a convex lens.And here you see all three together,showing us all these reflections.We tried turning them down,we tried blocking them,nothing was working.You can see here,usually Eve.So here we have Eve on the first lens,we put Eve on the second lens,it's not working.We turn it down,it's still not working.And then we have our eureka moment.the way nothing else has.Now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye.As humans we have the white of our eye,the colored irisand the black pupil.Now WALL-E has the black of an eye,the gray aperture bladesand the black pupil.Suddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul,Later in the movie towards the end,WALL-E loses his personality,essentially going dead.(Video) WALL-E: Eva?This was one of those scenes.The director had a vision for this sceneAs we went along,we were floundering.The reviews with the directorMaybe because unlike normal,or maybe just because we had lost our way.the science without the art.But even through all the frustrations,I still believed it could be beautiful.So when it came in to lighting,I dug in.the undulating fog beams,something promising began to appear.And I got excited.and she got excited.In director review,you hope you might get some nice words,And then, hopefully, you get a final,signaling to move on to the next stage.Just long enough for me to think,"Oh no, this is doomed."And then he started clapping.And then the whole room was clapping.The moment where it all comes togetherand we get a world that we can believe in.It's this interweaving of art and sciencea place with soul,a place we can believe in,and a world where a girl suddenly realizesnot only is she a scientist,but also an artist.Thank you.(Applause)

So in college,I was a government major,Now, when a normal student writes a paper,So, you know --(Laughter)you get started maybe a little slowly,but you get enough done in the first weekthat, with some heavier days later on,everything gets done, things stay civil.(Laughter)And I would want to do that like that.That would be the plan.I would have it all ready to go,and then I would kind of do this.(Laughter)And that would happen every single paper.But then came my 90-page senior thesis,It was way too big a project.So I planned things out,This is how the year would go.So I'd start off light,and I'd bump it up in the middle months,just like a little staircase.No big deal, right?But then, the funniest thing happened.Those first few months?They came and went,and I couldn't quite do stuff.So we had an awesome new revised plan.(Laughter)And then --(Laughter)and I didn't really write words,and so we were here.And then two months turned into one month,which turned into two weeks.And one day I woke upwith three days until the deadline,still not having written a word,and so I did the only thing I could:I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,pulling not one but two all-nighters --sprinted across campus,dove in slow motion,and got it in just at the deadline.I thought that was the end of everything.But a week later I get a call,and it's the school.And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?"And I say, "Yeah."And I say, "OK."And they say,"It's the best one we've ever seen."(Laughter)(Applause)That did not happen.(Laughter)It was a very, very bad thesis.(Laughter)"This guy is amazing!"(Laughter)No, no, it was very, very bad.Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.I write the blog Wait But Why.and why we are the way we are.Now, I had a hypothesisthan the brains of other people.And to test this, I found an MRI labthat actually let me scan both my brainso I could compare them.(Laughter)Now ...here's my brain.(Laughter)There is a difference.but the procrastinator's brainalso has an Instant Gratification Monkey.to do something productive,but the Monkey doesn't like that plan,so he actually takes the wheel,(Laughter)Then --(Laughter)Then we're going to go over to the fridge,with Justin Bieber's mom.(Laughter)"All of that's going to take a while,Sorry!"(Sigh)Now, what is going on here?you want behind the wheel.He lives entirely in the present moment.and he only cares about two things:easy and fun.Now, in the animal world, that works fine.If you're a dogyou're a huge success!(Laughter)And to the Monkey,humans are just another animal species.the Rational Decision-Maker,We can visualize the future.We can see the big picture.We can make long-term plans.And he wants to just have us doNow, sometimes it makes senseto be doing things that are easy and fun,or enjoying well-earned leisure time.That's why there's an overlap.Sometimes they agree.But other times, it makes much more sensefor the sake of the big picture.And that's when we have a conflict.And for the procrastinator,I call it the Dark Playground.(Laughter)Now, the Dark Playground is a placeIt's where leisure activities happenThe fun you have in the Dark Playgroundall of those good procrastinator feelings.in his darkest moments --someone called the Panic Monster.(Laughter)or there's danger of public embarrassment,and invited me to do a TED Talk.(Laughter)Now, of course, I said yes.(Laughter)(Applause)But in the middle of all this excitement,so we can get a better feel for India."(Laughter)So that's what we did that day.(Laughter)staring right back at me.And guess who woke up?(Laughter)(Laughter)boom, he's up the tree!And finally,and I can start working on the talk.Now, the Panic Monster explainsthis is the procrastinator's system.It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.When I did, I was amazed by the response.Literally thousands of emails came in,doing all different kinds of things.and lots and lots of PhD students.(Laughter)"I have this problem too."and the heaviness of these emails.about what this Monkey had done to them.And I thought about this, and I said,they all have deadlines.And when there's deadlines,because the Panic Monster gets involved.to get momentum, get things going.that don't involve any deadlines,working on your relationshipis the Panic Monster, that's a problem,the Panic Monster doesn't show up.He has nothing to wake up for,they just extend outward forever.And it can be the sourceat times, in their own lives.Now, you might not all be a mess,like some of us,(Laughter)but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trickis when the deadlines aren't there.Now, I want to show you one last thing.I call this a Life Calendar.That's not that many boxes,That's a job for all of us.Well, maybe not today, but ...(Laughter)You know.Sometime soon.Thank you.(Applause)

I'm a textile artistor, more specifically,without permission and unsanctioned.But when I started this over 10 years ago,I didn't have a word for it,I had no visions of grandeur.So I wrapped the door handle.I call this the Alpha Piece.So clearly the reaction was interesting.The reaction was wild.People would park their carsand get out of their cars and stare at it,and scratch their heads and stare at it,and all of that was really exciting to meSo at this point I'm smitten.I'm hooked.This was all seductive.I found my new passionSo this is some of my early work.the mundane, even the ugly,And this was fun for me.and have them come to life.So ...I think we all see the humor in this,but --(Laughter)I wanted to analyze it.why I was passionate about it,And I realized something.I think we've all become desensitizedand billboards and advertisements,and giant parking lots,So when you stumble uponand it seems so out of placeand then gradually -- weirdly --you find a connection to it,that is the moment.That is the moment I loveSo at this point, my curiosity grew.to what else can I do with this material.So that's when the bus happened.This was a real game changer for me.but there wasn't much out thereSo at this point, I'm experiencing,or I'm witnessing something interesting.It had reached global status.that I'd never been to,this is a lot of my recent work --so was yarn bombing.Yarn bombing was also growing.and showed meIt was through this granny hobby --this unassuming hobby --that I found commonality with peopleSo as I tell my story today,I'd also like to convey to youand what they're capable of doing --building houses and furniture,and painting giant murals --And I'm totally guilty of this as well.But if you think about it,that had never been done before.I also wasn't "supposed to be" an artistI'm a math major actually.So as we ponder the future,Thank you.(Applause)

Ten years ago,I had my first exhibition here.in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan.And then this incredible thing happened.It transformed.One sculpture became two.Two quickly became 26.And before I knew it,This grew to a small community,And then finally, to an underwater museum,with over 500 living sculptures.We've since scaled up the designs:and weighing over 40 tons,to now currently in Lanzarote,on a really large scale.So why exhibit my work in the ocean?Because honestly, it's really not easy.(Laughter)(Music)an artist could ever wish for.a unique timeless quality(Music)But over the years,the really humbling thing about the work,they're not ours anymore,because as soon as we sink them,the sculptures, they belong to the sea.a world that continuously amazes me.can ever match the imagination of nature.Sponges look like veins across the faces.Staghorn coral morphs the form.Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed.Tunicates explode from the faces.Gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves.Purple sponges breathe water like air.and about what I'm trying to achieve.and this couldn't be a better placeBecause as we all know,So here's the thing:the most used, searched and shared imageof all my work thus far is this.And I think this is for a reason,or at least I hope it is.and unexpected results.between the museum and the natural reefs,from a nearby oil refinery.to manage tourism and fishing quotas.by National Geographic.So why are we all here today in this room?What do we all have in common?I think we all share a fearthat we don't protect our oceans enough.And one way of thinking about thisand we should.When we see incredible places --or the Mona Lisa, even --we understand their importance.We call them sacred,and to keep them safe.But in order to do that,otherwise, it will be desecratedWhen we were naming the site in Cancun,museums are places of preservation,of conservation and of education.we'd all go crazy.at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,then we would laugh them out of Arizona.And I think it's easier for us to do that,because when we see the ocean,we don't see the havoc we're wreaking.Because for most people,the ocean is like this.And it's really hardAnd what do you see here?So I think there's a real dangerthat we never really see the sea,and if we don't really see it,if it doesn't have its own iconography,if we miss its majesty,Cancun is famous for spring break,tequila and foam parties.and banana boats.that is simply precious for being itself.And we don't want to stop in Grenada,in Cancun or the Bahamas.in the Thames River,We want to team up with other inventors,to see better futures for our oceans.And we want to see beyond sculpture,beyond art, even.Say you're a 14-year-old kid from the city,and you've never seen the ocean.or an aquarium,you get taken out to the ocean,to an underwater Noah's Ark,be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean.Clearly, it would blow your mind.So let's think big and let's think deep.and visual impact of the setting,of seeing the seas:as delicate, precious places,worthy of our protection.Our oceans are sacred.Thank you.(Applause)

It was the 1970s.was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.(Video) Voice-over: What a jump!Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.Chris Milk: So this was my joy back then.I rode this motorcycle everywhere.I wanted the rocket.I felt so connected to this world.I was there. Evel Knievel was my friend.I had so much empathy for him.But it didn't work out. (Laughter)I went to art school.I started making music videos.(Music: "Touch the Sky" by Kanye West)(Laughter)And I got that rocket.(Laughter)for people that are very different than usUnfortunately,and he sued us for this video --(Laughter) --shortly thereafter.I was finally able to get his autograph.(Applause)Let's talk about film now.Film, it's an incredible medium,But I started thinking about,to tell stories in different waysand tell different kinds of storiesthat we've been using for 100 years?So I started experimenting,And here's one of the early experiments:(Music)It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.It's a website.But then I started thinking,okay, well that's a part of you,(Music)So now I've got you inside of the frame,to this work than the previous one.And a frame is just a window.in the world, inhabiting the world.So that leads me back to virtual reality.Let's talk about virtual reality.Unfortunately,(Laughter)You feel your way inside of it.It's a machine, but inside of it,So we're shooting in every direction.This is a camera system that we builtand the United Nations,and a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.(Video) Sidra: My name is Sidra.I am 12 years old.I am in the fifth grade.I have a big family:three brothers, one is a baby.He cries a lot.you're not seeing it like this.You're looking around through this world.And because of that,you feel her humanity in a deeper way.You empathize with her in a deeper way.And we showed it to a group of peoplethey suddenly all found themselves there.(Applause)And they were affected by it.So we're going to make more of them.to shoot a whole series of these films.And we're taking these films,of the true power of virtual reality.It's not a video game peripheral.And that's how I thinkSo, it's a machine,And ultimately, we become more human.Thank you.(Applause)

(Laughter)I have a giraffe here.Sir, you caught the giraffe.I have a playing card in my hand.Freely name any card in the deck.Audience member: 10 of hearts.Helder Guimarães: 10 of hearts.You could have named any card in the deck,but you said the 10 of hearts.Ninety percent of everything is crap,(Laughter)(Applause)(Laughter)Sir, this is not your show.(Laughter)Keep the giraffe for a moment, okay?Jesus.(Laughter)Crazy people.Well, the truth is,why is the majority of everything bad?I'll give you a clear little example,not this century, the other one.The idea was to take a piece of paperin my case, the left hand.Something that would look like this.(Laughter)But that's okay, I understand why.We stop thinking too soon.like a paper clip.I use my hand closed into a fist,something that would look like this.Now -- no, no, no.Sturgeon may be correct.But he doesn't have to be correct forever.Things can always change.Sir, what was the card?The 10 of hearts?the 10 of hearts.(Applause)Secrets are important.And secrets are valuable.an old man and a claim,"I will not touch the deck till the end."It doesn't matter who the man was,"I will not touch the deck till the end."Now, during all this time,he was holding a small notebookand look at something."I will not touch the deck till the end."Now sir, you have the giraffe.Go ahead, throw it in any directionThe old man turned to me and he said,My answer was ...Audience member 2: The black card.HG: Indeed!It was a black card.He said, "It could be a club or a spade,"and my answer was ...Audience member 2: Spade.HG: Indeed! It was a spade.And my answer was ...Audience member 2: A high spade.HG: Indeed! It was a high spade.a jack, king, queen or the ace of spades.And my answer was ...Audience member 2: The king.HG: The king of spades, indeed.Now sir, let's be fair.You selected black, you selected spade,HG: But it was a free choice, correct?a number between one and 52.And the first number I thought of was ...Audience member 2: 17.HG: Indeed! It was the 17.The old man only said one more thing:"This is the end."And I knew exactly what that meant.He took the deck out of the box.Nothing in the box.The tension was building.(Laughter)"11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17."The old man stood up, he left.I never saw him again.But he left his notebookthat was there from the beginning.And when I picked it up,We are defined by the secrets we keepand by the secrets we share.(Applause)Crazy shit! Now --(Laughter)I really do.to search for those amazing things.So you have the giraffe,Sir, I'm going to ask you,Audience member 3: I think so.HG: Yes? You see, a coincidence!(Laughter)Let's make sure you have it.Do you have it?I have a dollar bill here to explain.I want you to take the dollar bill,So you get this kind of big square, okay?so it becomes like a rectangle,and when you have it,and let me know when you have it.Do you have it? Perfect.Now, I'm going to approach,and before we start,And this is the reason why:and I don't want you to think,oh, while I was distracted by Helder,someone came onstage and swapped the bill.and put it around the bill.and see what I don't want to see.Is that fair?Now you can give me the marker back.And just like that, very clearly,from the beginning of this experienceYes, perfect, so that you can see.That's your signature? Yes? Perfect.to search for an amazing coincidence.Do you mind, can you help me with this?Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle.You can take some cards and shuffle.You can shuffle cards like this.something like this.You can shuffle cards in the American way.Do you mind doing that for me, sir?Please cut and complete.Up in the air.And just like that.I'm going to try.I have some cards that maybe,maybe they don't mean anything.Because maybe, maybe they mean a lot.Is that your signature?Audience member 3: Yes it is.HG: I want you to see very clearlythat I'm going to open your billand reveal a small secret that we created.Madam, can you take the dollar bill?In the serial number, there is a letter.What is the first number after the letter?Audience member 4: Seven.HG: Seven.Seven.But, that's maybe just one coincidence.So after the seven, we have a nine.And after the nine?Audience member 4: Two.HG: The two. And after the two?Audience member 4: Three.HG: Three, and after?Audience member 4: Q.HG: Q like in queen?(Applause)The queen of clubs!All the cards in order, just for you.And that's my show.Thank you very much and have a nice night.(Applause)

Thank you.I have only got 18 minutesso I'd better get started.not much drama.A few years back,Norway's public TV channel NRKseven hours of simple footage,a train rolling down the tracks.A new kind of reality TV show was born,There is no story line, no script,no drama, no climax,and it's called Slow TV.For the past two months,and there's a lot of fog on that coast.On the surface, it sounds boring,because it is,but something about this TV experimenthas gripped Norwegians.(Laughter)Al Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there?We have to go back to 2009,Where do you get your ideas?In the lunchroom.Wow. Brilliant idea, exceptSo we sat in our lunchroom and discussedWhat other things take a really long time?So one of us came up with a train.over seven hours. (Laughter)and we want to make it in full length,and the answer was,"Yes, but how long will the program be?""Oh," we said, "full length.""Yes, but we mean the program."And back and forth.so one bright day in September,We had four cameras,TH: And that's about it,but of course, alsoWe pass Mjølfjell Station.Then a new tunnel.(Laughter)We brought it on air in November 2009.But no, this was far more attractive.and if you look at NRK2 over here,(Applause)And another funny thing:When the host on our main channel,after they have got news for you,she said, "And on our second channel,discussing the same view,He's watched all the program,and his head hit the curtain rod,(Applause)So that's strong and living TV.and during that first night,to 8,040, minute by minute,and do the iconic journey in Norway,So just a week after the Bergen Railway,We wanted to do something different.The Bergen Railway was a recorded program.So when we sat in our editing room,we saw this journalist.We had called him, we had spoken to him,and when we left the station,and we thought,Would more people show up?What would it look like?This is back in 1964,So in June 2011,and we set off.(Music)This guy, for instance,(Laughter)And I will show you a piece of cloth,this one.It's the other strong memory.It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen.they made the program what it became.They made all the stories.This is Karl. He's in the ninth grade.(Laughter)How did we do this?We made it all work, of course,and then we took along 11 cameras.This is one of them.This is my sketch from February,in the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK,you get some cool stuff back.And with some very creative solutions.Eight wires keep the camera stable.100 kilomteres away,like this one. (Laughter)He's doing fine. Everything went well.and they all had a phone in their hand.and people get so extremely happyand Twitter couldn't quite handle it.And we also, on the web,to 148 nations,because Hurtigruten was selectedas the longest documentary ever.(Applause)Thank you.But it's a long program,Some watched a little bit more.though it probably won't. (Laughter)You can see the famous Trollfjordand a day after, all-time high for NRK2.they will look like this,It looks like this:and we are only five million here.(Laughter) --and watching out the window.with this strange TV program,with music, nature, people.And Slow TV was now a buzzword,like with the railway and the Hurtigruten,or we could take a topic and make it long.actually 87 days on the web.and that's quite slow.called "National Firewood Night,"and "The Amazing Glacier Race."20 percent.why not knitting?So on our next project,and Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show,he liked that.(Music)to break the world record.They did not succeed,but remember the old Norwegian saying,(Laughter)TH: Exactly. So why does this stand out?actually being on the train, on the boat,and knitting together with others,is because we don't edit the timeline.This is a picture from last summerbut more important is what you don't plan.You don't plan what's going to happen.It's like a sports event.You rig them and you see what's happening.and I'll give you an example of that.This is from last summer,and as a TV producer,But this is Slow TV,and then you keep it a little bit longer,and when you keep it that long,Some of you have seen the flag.Has he left? Is he watching the cow?And where is that cow going?and we kept it for 10 minutes,That's Slow TV.that's the idea when people say,"Oh no, you can't put that on TV."Thank you.(Applause)

Puzzlesand magic.I work in what most people thinkare two distinct fields,but I believe they are the same.I am both a magician anda New York Times crossword puzzle constructor,which basically means I've takenthe world's two nerdiest hobbiesand combined them into one career.And I believe that magic and puzzles are the samebecause they both key into one ofthe most important human drives:the urge to solve.Human beings are wired to solve,to make order out of chaos.It's certainly true for me.I've been solving my whole life.and not really talking to girls,and then at about that timeI started learning magic tricksand definitely not talking to girls.There's nothing like starting a conversation with,"Hey, did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth20 points in Scrabble?"But back then, I noticed an intersectionbetween puzzles and illusion.When you do the crossword puzzleor when you watch a magic show,you become a solver,and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos,the chaos of, say, a black-and-white puzzle grid,a mixed-up bag of Scrabble tiles,or a shuffled pack of playing cards.And today, as a cruciverbalist —23 points —and an illusion designer, I create that chaos.I test your ability to solve.Now, it turns out research tells usthat solving is as primal as eating and sleeping.From birth, we are wired to solve.In one UCLA study, newborns still in the hospitalwere shown patterns, patterns like this:circle, cross, circle, cross.And then the pattern was changed: triangle, square.And by tracking an infant's gaze,we know that newborns as young as a day oldcan notice and respond to disruptions in order.It's remarkable.So from infancy through old age,the urge to solve unites us all,and I even found this photo on Instagramof pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzlewith her morning coffee.Like.(Laughter)Now, solving exists across all cultures.The American invention is the crossword puzzle,and this year we are celebratingthe 100th anniversary of the crossword puzzle,first published in The New York World.China gives us tangrams,which would test solvers' abilitiesto form shapes from the jumbled pieces.Chaos. Order.Order.And order.That one's my favorite, let's hear it again.Okay.And how about this puzzleinvented in 18th-century England:the jigsaw puzzle.Is this not making order out of chaos?So as you can see,we are always solving.We are always trying to decode our world.It's an eternal quest.It's just like the one Cervantes wrote aboutin "Don Quixote,"which by the way is the root of the word "quixotry,"the highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time,365 points.But anyway, "Don Quixote" is an important book.You guys have read "Don Quixote," yes?I'm seeing some heads nod.Come on guys, really?There we go. Smart audience.Who's read "Don Quixote?" Get them up.Okay, good, because I need somebody smart herebecause now I'm going to demonstratewith the help of one of youjust how deeply rooted your urge to solve is,just how wired to solve all of you really are,so I'm going to come into the audienceand find somebody to help me.Let's see.Everybody's looking away all of a sudden.Can I? Would you? What is your name? Gwen.I'm not a mind reader, I can see your name tag.Gwen, after you.(Applause)Are you so excited?Did you know that your name is wortheight points in Scrabble?Okay, stand right here, Gwen, right here.Now, Gwen, before we begin,I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle,which is here in this envelope,and I will not go near it. Okay?You can see we have an owl, we have a horse,a donkey, a rooster, an ox, and a sheep,and then here, Gwen, we havesome fancy art store markers,colors like, can you see that word right there?But we have a silver, a red, an emerald,and an amber marker,and Gwen, you are going to color this drawingjust like you were five years old,one marker at a time.It's going to be a lot of fun.But I'm going to go over here.I don't want to see what you're doing.Okay, so don't start yet.Wait for me to get over here and close my eyes.Now Gwen, are you ready?Pick up just one marker, pick up just one marker,and why don't you color in the horse for me?Color in the horse — big, big, big scribbles,broad strokes, don't worry about staying in the lines.All right. Great.And why don't you take that marker and recap itand place it on the table for me.Okay, and pick up another marker out of the cupand take off the capand color in the donkey for me, color in the donkey.Big scribbles.Okay, cool, and re-cap that markerand place it on the table.And pick up another marker for meand take off the cap. Isn't this fun?And color in the owl for me.Color in the owl.Okay, and recap that markerand pick up another marker out of the cupand color in the rooster for me, color in the rooster.Good, good, good, good, good.Big, big, big strokes. Good, good.Pick up another marker out of the cupand color in the ox for me. Color in the ox.Okay, good.and pick up another marker out of the cup.Oh, I'm out? Okay, I'm going to turn around.Did I forget? Oh, I forgot my purple marker.This is still going to work, though.I think this is still going to work, mostly.So Gwen, I'm going to hand you this envelope.Don't open it yet. Do not open it yet,but I am going to write down your choicesso that everybody can seethe choices that you made.Okay, great. So we have a cobalt horse,amber owl,a silver ox,yes, okay, a red donkey,and what was the emerald color? A rooster.An emerald rooster. Okay.Now for the moment of truth, Gwen,we're going to take a look in that envelope.Why don't you open it up and removethe one piece of paper from insideand hand it to me,and we will see if it matches your choices.Yes, I think it does.We have a cobalt horse, we have a red donkey,I forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep,Gwen, well done. That's beautiful. (Applause)I'll take that back from you.So ladies and gentlemen, how is this possible?How is this possible? Well, could it bethat Gwen's brain is so wired to solvethat she decoded hidden messages?Well this is the puzzle I present to you.Could there be orderin the chaos that I created?Let's take a closer look.Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces?What image did it ultimately become? A cobalt horse.The plot thickens.And then we played a game of tangramswith an emerald rooster.That one's my favorite.And then we had an experiment with a silver ox.And Katy Perry drinks her morning coffeeout of an amber owl.Thank you, Katy, for taking that photo for me.Oh, and there's one more, there's one more.I believe you colored a red donkey, Gwen.Ladies and gentlemen, could you raise your handsfor me if you've read "Don Quixote?"Who's read "Don Quixote?" (Laughter)But wait, but wait, wait, wait, wait, there's more.There's more.Gwen, I was so confidentthat you were going to make these choicesthat I made another prediction,and I put it in an even more indelible place,and it's right here.Ladies and gentlemen,we have today's New York Times.The date is March 18th, 2014.Many of you in the first couple of rowshave it underneath your seats as well.Really dig. We hid them under there.See if you can fish out the newspaperand open up to the arts sectionand you will find the crossword puzzle,and the crossword puzzle todaywas written by yours truly.You can see my name above the grid.I'm going to give this to you, Gwen, to take a look.And I will also put it up on the screen.Now let's take a lookat another piece of the puzzle.If you look at the first clue for 1-across,it starts with the letter C, for corrupt,and just below that we have an O, for outfielder,you get cobalt horse,amber owl, silver ox,red donkey, and emerald rooster.(Applause)That's pretty cool, right?It's The New York Times.But wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.Oh, Gwen,do you recall how I forgot my purple marker,and you were unable to color the sheep?Well, if you keep readingstarting with 25-down,it says,"Oh, by the way,the sheep can be left blank."(Laughter) (Applause)But wait, wait, wait, there's one more thing,there's one more thing,there's one final piece of the puzzle.Gwen, I am so grateful for your choicesbecause if we take a lookat the first letters of your combinations,we get "C-H-A-O-S" for chaosand "O-R-D-E-R" for order.That's chaos and order.We've all made order out of chaos.So ladies and gentlemen, the next timeyou find yourself with a puzzle,whether it's in your life or in your work,or maybe it's at the Sunday morningbreakfast table with The New York Times,remember, you are all wired to solve.Thank you.(Applause)



aj_jacobs_the_world_s_largest_family_reunion_we_re_all_invited

Six months ago, I got an emailfrom a man in Israelwho had read one of my books,and the email said,"You don't know me,but I'm your 12th cousin."And it said, "I have a family treewith 80,000 people on it, including you,Karl Marx,and several European aristocrats."Now I did not know what to make of this.Part of me was like, okay,when's he going to ask me to wire10,000 dollars to his Nigerian bank, right?I also thought, 80,000 relatives,do I want that?I have enough trouble with some of the onesI have already.And I won't name names, but you know who you are.But another part of me said, this is remarkable.Here I am alone in my office, but I'm not alone at all.I'm connected to 80,000 people around the world,and that's four Madison Square Gardensfull of cousins.And some of them are going to be great,and some of them are going to be irritating,but they're all related to me.So this email inspired me to dive into genealogy,but it turns out it's going through a fascinatingrevolution, and a controversial one.Partly, this is because of DNA and genetic testing,but partly, it's because of the Internet.There are sites that now takethe Wikipedia approach to family trees,collaboration and crowdsourcing,and what you do is,you load your family tree on,and then these sites searchto see if the A.J. Jacobs in your treeis the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree,and if it is, then you can combine,and then you combine and combine and combineuntil you get these massive,mega-family treeswith thousands of people on them,or even millions.I'm on something on Geni calledthe world family tree,which has no less than a jaw-dropping75 million people.So that's 75 million people connected by bloodor marriage, sometimes both.(Laughter)It's in all seven continents, including Antarctica.I'm on it. Many of you are on it,whether you know it or not,and you can see the links.Here's my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow.She has no idea I exist,but we are officially cousins.We have just 17 links between us.And there's my cousin Barack Obama.(Laughter)And he is my aunt's fifth great-aunt's husband'sfather's wife's seventh great-nephew,so practically my old brother.And my cousin, of course,the actor Kevin Bacon --(Laughter) —who is my first cousin's twice removed'swife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed'sniece's husband.So six degrees of Kevin Bacon,plus or minus several degrees.Now, I'm not boasting, because all of youhave famous people and historical figuresin your tree, because we are all connected,and 75 million may seem like a lot,but in a few years, it's quite likelywe will have a family treewith all, almost all, seven billion people on Earth.But does it really matter?What's the importance?And I do think it is important,and I'll give you five reasons why, really quickly.First, it's got scientific value.This is an unprecedented history of the human race,and it's giving us valuable dataabout how diseases are inherited,how people migrate,and there's a team of scientists at MIT right nowstudying the world family tree.Number two, it brings history alive.I found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein,so I told my seven-year-old son that,and he was totally engaged.Now Albert Einstein is not some dead white guywith weird hair.He's Uncle Albert. (Laughter)And my son wanted to know,"What did he say? What is E = MC squared?"Also, it's not all good news.I found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer,but I will say that's on my wife's side.(Laughter) (Applause)So I want to make that clear. Sorry, honey.Number three, interconnectedness.We all come from the same ancestor,but scientists talk about Y chromosomal Adamand mitochondrial Eve,and these were about 100,000 to 300,000 years ago.We all have a bit of their DNA in us.They are our great-great-great-great-great-great --continue that for about 7,000 times --grandparents,and so that means we literally all arebiological cousins as well,and estimates vary, but probablythe farthest cousin you have on Earthis about a 50th cousin.Now, it's not just ancestors we share, descendants.If you have kids, and they have kids,look how quickly the descendants accumulate.So in 10, 12 generations,you're going to have thousands of offspring,and millions of offspring.Number four, a kinder world.Now, I know that there are family feuds.I have three sons, so I see how they fight.But I think that there's also a human biasto treat your family a little better than strangers.I think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots,because they're going to have to realizethat they are cousins with thousands of peoplein whatever ethnic group they happento have issues with,and I think you look back at history,and you can't do that anymore.We're not just part of the same species.We're part of the same family.We share 99.9 percent of our DNA.Now the final one is number five,a democratizing effect.Some genealogy has an elitist strain,like people say, "Oh, I'm descendedfrom Mary Queen of Scotsand you're not, so you cannot join my country club."But that's really going to be hard to do now,because everyone is related.I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots --by marriage, but still.So it's really a fascinating timein the history of family,because it's changing so fast.There is gay marriage and sperm donorsa little nervous,but I actually think it's a good thing.I think the more inclusive the idea of family is,the better,because then you have more potential caretakers,and as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removedHillary Clinton says --(Laughter) —it takes a village.So I have all these hundreds and thousands,millions of new cousins.I thought, what can I do with this information?And that's when I decided,why not throw a party?So that's what I'm doing.And you're all invited.Next year, next summer,I will be hosting what I hope isthe biggest and best family reunion in history.(Applause)Thank you. I want you there.I want you there.It's going to be at the New York Hall of Science,which is a great venue,but it's also on the site of the former World's Fair,which is, I think, very appropriate,because I see this as a family reunionmeets a world's fair.There's going to be exhibits and food, music.Paul McCartney is 11 steps away,so I'm hoping he brings his guitar.He hasn't RSVP'd yet, but fingers crossed.And there is going to be a day of speakers,of fascinating cousins.It's early, but I've already,I've got some lined up.Cass Sunstein, my cousin who is perhapsthe most brilliant legal scholar, will be talking.And on the other side of the political spectrum,George H.W. Bush, number 41, the father,he has agreed to participate,and Nick Kroll, the comedian,and Dr. Oz, and many more to come.And, of course, the most important is that you,I want you guys there,and I invite you to go to GlobalFamilyReunion.organd figure out how you're on the family tree,because these are big issues, family and tribe,and I don't know all the answers,but I have a lot of smart relatives,including you guys,so together, I think we can figure it out.Only together can we solve these big problems.So from cousin to cousin,I thank you. I can't wait to see you.Goodbye.(Applause)

The most romantic thing to ever happen to me onlinestarted out the way most things do:without me, and not online.On December 10, 1896, the man on the medal,Alfred Nobel, died.One hundred years later, exactly, actually,December 10, 1996,this charming lady, Wislawa Szymborska,won the Nobel Prize for literature.She's a Polish poet.She's a big deal, obviously,but back in '96, I thought I had never heard of her,and when I checked out her work,I found this sweet little poem,"Four in the Morning.""The hour from night to day.The hour from side to side.The hour for those past thirty..."And it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem,I fell for it hard,so hard, I suspected we must have metsomewhere before.Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem?Did I flirt with this poemin a coffee shop somewhere?I could not place it, and it bugged me,and then in the coming week or two,I would just be watching an old movie,and this would happen.We didn't get home till around four in the morning.Rives: My roommates would have the TV on,and this would happen.(Music: Seinfeld theme)watching that Omen trilogy.Rives: I would be listening to music,and this would happen.Rives: So you can see what was going on, right?Obviously, the demigods of coincidencewere just messing with me.Some people get a number stuck in their head,you may recognize a certain name or a tune,some people get nothing, but four in the morningwas in me now, but mildly,like a groin injury.I always assumed it would just go awayon its own eventually,and I never talked about it with anybody,but it did not, and I totally did.In 2007, I was invited to speak at TEDfor the second time,and since I was still an authority on nothing,I thought, what if I made a multimedia presentationon a topic so nicheit is actually inconsequentialor actually cockamamie.but it also had examplesfrom my fellow TED speakers that year.I found four in the morning in a novelby Isabel Allende.I found a really great onein the autobiography of Bill Clinton.I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening,although Matt Groening told me laterthat he could not make my talkbecause it was a morning sessionand I gather that he is not an early riser.However, had Matt been there,he would have seen this mock conspiracy theorythat was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble.It was totally contrivedjust for that room, just for that moment.That's how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.It was fun. That was pretty much it.from people who had seen the talk live,beginning with, and this is still my favorite,"Here's another one for your collection:The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich.The email itself was from another verysexy European type,TED Curator Chris Anderson.(Laughter)Chris found this quoteon a coffee cup or something,and I'm thinking, this man is the Typhoid Maryof ideas worth spreading, and I have infected him.I am contagious,which was confirmed less than a week laterwhen a Hallmark employee scanned and sentan actual greeting cardwith that same quotation.It says, "Just knowing I can call youat four in the morning if I need tomakes me not really need to,"which I love, because together these are like,"Hallmark: When you care enoughto send the very best twice,phrased slightly differently."I was not surprised at the TEDsterand New Yorker magazine overlap.A bunch of people sent me this when it came out.I was surprised at the TEDster/"Rugrats" overlap.More than one person sent me this.Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding?Stu Pickles: Because I've lost control of my life.(Laughter)Rives: And then there was the lone TEDsterwho was disgruntled I had overlookedwhat he considers to be a classic.Ronnie: Not at four o'clock in the morning.Rives: So that's "Close Encounters,"and the main character is all worked upbecause aliens, momentously,have chosen to show themselves to earthlingsat four in the morning,which does make that a very solid example.Those were all really solid examples.They did not get me any closer to understandingwhy I thought I recognized this one particular poem.But they followed the pattern. They played along.Right? Four in the morning as this scapegoat hourwhen all these dramatic occurrencesallegedly occur.Maybe this was some kind of clichethat had never been taxonomized before.Maybe I was on the trailof a new meme or something.Just when things were getting pretty interesting,things got really interesting.TED.com launched, later that year,with a bunch of videos from past talks,including mine,and I started receiving "four in the morning" citationsMuch of it was content I never would have foundon my own if I was looking for it,and I was not.I don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes.I probably would have missed the booklet,"Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning."(Laughter)I do not subscribe to Crochet Today! magazine,although it looks delightful. (Laughter)Take note of those clock ends.This is a college student's suggestionfor what a "four in the morning" gang signshould look like.People sent me magazine ads.They took photographs in grocery stores.I got a ton of graphic novels and comics.A lot of good quality work, too:"The Sandman," "Watchmen."In fact, the oldest citation anybody sent inwas from a cartoon from the Stone Age.Take a look.(Video) Wilma Flintstone: Like how early?Fred Flintstone: Like at 4 a.m., that's how early.Rives: And the flip side of the timeline,this is from the 31st century.A thousand years from now,people are still doing this.(Video): Announcer: The time is 4 a.m.(Laughter)Rives: It shows the spectrum.I received so many songs, TV shows, movies,like from dismal to famous,I could give you a four-hour playlist.If I just stick to modern male movie stars,I keep it to the lengthof about a commercial.Here's your sampler.(Movie montage of "It's 4 a.m.")(Laughter)Rives: So somewhere along the line,I realized I have a hobbyI didn't know I wanted,and it is crowdsourced.But I was also thinking what you might be thinking,which is really, couldn't you do thiswith any hour of the day?First of all, you are not getting clips like thatabout four in the afternoon.Secondly, I did a little research.You know, I was kind of interested.If this is confirmation bias,there is so much confirmation, I am biased.Literature probably shows it best.There's a five in the morning.There are seven four in the mornings,and they're all very dire.Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomniaat four in the morning right before battlein "War and Peace."Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre" has got kind ofa pivotal four in the morning,as does Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights.""Lolita" has as a creepy four in the morning."Huckleberry Finn" has one in dialect.Someone sent in H.G. Wells' "The Invisible Man."Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man.""The Great Gatsby" spends the lastfour in the morning of his lifewaiting for a lover who never shows,and the most famous wake-up in literature, perhaps,"The Metamorphosis."First paragraph, the main character wakes uptransformed into a giant cockroach,but we already know, cockroach notwithstanding,something is up with this guy.Why? His alarm is set for four o'clock in the morning.What kind of person would do that?This kind of person would do that.(Music)(4 a.m. alarm clock montage)But of course, there is no news yet.Everyone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy beds.Rives: Exactly.So that's Lucy from the Peanuts,"Mommie Dearest", Rocky, first day of training,Nelson Mandela, first day in office,and Bart Simpson, which combined with a cockroachwould give you one hell of a dinner partyand gives me yet another category,people waking up, in my big old database.Just imagine that your friends and your familyhave heard that you collect, say, stuffed polar bears,and they send them to you.Even if you don't really, at a certain point,you totally collect stuffed polar bears,and your collection is probably pretty kick-ass.And when I got to that point, I embraced it.I got my curator on. I started fact checking,downloading, illegally screen-grabbing.I started archiving.My hobby had become a habit,and my habit gave me possibly the world'smost eclectic Netflix queue.At one point, it went, "Guys and Dolls: The Musical,""Last Tango in Paris,""Diary of a Wimpy Kid,""Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy."Why "Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy"?(Video) Ron Jeremy: I was bornin Flushing, Queenson March, 12, 1953,at four o'clock in the morning.Rives: Of course he was. (Laughter) (Applause)Yeah. Not only does it seem to make sense,it also answers the question,"What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoirhave in common?"Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiographyand when they did, I had another bump upin my entry for this, because porn star Ron Jeremyand feminist Simone de Beauvoirare not just different people.and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledgeor inadvertent expertise, but I did wonder,is there maybe a cooler way to do this?So last October, in gentleman scholar tradition,I put the entire collection onlineas "Museum of Four in the Morning."You can click on that red "refresh" button.It will take you at random to one ofhundreds of snippets that are in the collection.Here is a knockout poemby Billy Collins called "Forgetfulness."(Video) Billy Collins: No wonder you risein the middle of the nightto look up the date of a famous battlein a book on war.No wonder the moon in the windowseems to have drifted out of a love poemthat you used to know by heart.Rives: So the first hour of this projectwas satisfying.A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe.Half a globe away, a teenagermade an Instagram video of it and sent it to me,a stranger.Less than a week later, though,I received a little bit of grace.I received a poignant tweet.It was brief.It just said, "Reminds me of an ancient mix tape."As soon as I saw the initials, and the profile pic,I knew immediately, my whole body knewimmediately who this was,and I knew immediatelywhat mix tape she was talking about.(Music)L.D. was my college romance.This is in the early '90s. I was an undegrad.Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off,lets her hair down, suddenly she's smoking hot.She was already smoking hot,she was super dorky,and we had a December-May romance,meaning we started dating in December,and by May, she had graduatedand became my one that got away.But her mix tape did not get away.I have kept this mix tape in a boxwith notes and postcards, not just from L.D.,from my life, but for decades.It's the kind of box where,if I have a girlfriend, I tend to hide it from her,and if I had a wife, I'm sure I would share it with her,but the story — (Laughter) — with this mix tapeis there are seven songs per side,but no song titles.Instead, L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congressclassification system, including page numbers,to leave me clues.When I got this mix tape,I put it in my cassette player,I took it to the campus library, her library,I found 14 books on the shelves.I remember bringing them allto my favorite corner table,and I read poems paired to songslike food to wine,paired, I can tell you,like saddle shoesto a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress.I did this again last October.I'm sitting there, I got new earbuds,old Walkman, I realize this is just the kindof extravagance I used to take for grantedeven when I was extravagant.And then I thought, "Good for him.""PG" is Slavic literature."7000" series Polish literature.Z9A24 is a collection of 70 poems.Page 31 is Wislawa Szymborska's poempaired with Paul Simon's "Peace Like a River."(Music: Paul Simon, "Peace Like a River")(Video) Paul Simon: ♪ Oh, four in the morning ♪♪ I woke up from out of my dream ♪Rives: Thank you. Appreciate it. (Applause)

Let me introduce you tosomething I've been working on.It's what the Victorian illusionistswould have described as a mechanical marvel,an automaton,a thinking machine.Say hello to EDI.Now he's asleep. Let's wake him up.EDI, EDI.These mechanical performers were popularthroughout Europe.Audiences marveled at the way they moved.It was science fiction made true,robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age,machines far in advance of anythingthat Victorian technology could create,a machine we would later knowas the robot.EDI: Robot. A word coined in 1921in a science fiction taleby the Czech playwright Karel Čapek.It comes from "robota."It means "forced labor."Marco Tempest: But these robots were not real.They were not intelligent.They were illusions,a clever combination of mechanical engineeringand the deceptiveness of the conjurer's art.EDI is different.EDI is real.EDI: I am 176 centimeters tall.MT: He weighs 300 pounds.EDI: I have two seven-axis arms —MT: Core of sensing —EDI: A 360-degree sonar detection system,and come complete with a warranty.MT: We love robots.EDI: Hi. I'm EDI. Will you be my friend?MT: We are intrigued by the possibilityof creating a mechanical version of ourselves.We build them so they look like us,behave like us, and think like us.The perfect robot will be indistinguishablefrom the human,and that scares us.In the first story about robots,they turn against their creators.It's one of the leitmotifs of science fiction.EDI: Ha ha ha. Now you are the slavesand we robots, the masters.Your world is ours. You —MT: As I was saying,besides the faces and bodies we give our robots,we cannot read their intentions,and that makes us nervous.When someone hands an object to you,you can read intention in their eyes, their face,their body language.That's not true of the robot.Now, this goes both ways.EDI: Wow!MT: Robots cannot anticipate human actions.EDI: You know, humans are so unpredictable,not to mention irrational.I literally have no ideawhat you guys are going to do next, you know,but it scares me.MT: Which is why humans and robots find it difficultto work in close proximity.Accidents are inevitable.EDI: Ow! That hurt.MT: Sorry. Now, one way of persuading humansthat robots are safeis to create the illusion of trust.Much as the Victoriansfaked their mechanical marvels,we can add a layer of deceptionto help us feel more comfortablewith our robotic friends.With that in mind, I set about teaching EDIa magic trick.Abracadabra.MT: Abracadabra?EDI: Yeah. It's all part of the illusion, Marco.Come on, keep up.MT: Magic creates the illusion ofan impossible reality.Technologycan do the same.Alan Turing, a pioneer of artificial intelligence,spoke about creating the illusionthat a machine could think.EDI: A computer would deserveto be called intelligentif it deceived a human into believingit was human.MT: In other words, if we do not yet havethe technological solutions,would illusions serve the same purpose?To create the robotic illusion,we've devised a set of ethical rules,a code that all robots would live by.EDI: A robot may not harm humanity,or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm.Thank you, Isaac Asimov.MT: We anthropomorphize our machines.We give them a friendly faceand a reassuring voice.EDI: I am EDI.I became operational at TED in March 2014.MT: We let them entertain us.Most important, we make them indicatethat they are aware of our presence.EDI: Marco, you're standing on my foot!MT: Sorry. They'll be conscious of our fragile frameand move aside if we got too close,and they'll account for our unpredictabilityand anticipate our actions.And now, under the spell of a technological illusion,we could ignore our fearsand truly interact.(Music)Thank you.EDI: Thank you!(Applause)(Music)MT: And that's it. Thank you very much,(Applause)



joe_kowan_how_i_beat_stage_fright

Joe Kowan: I have stage fright.I've always had stage fright,and not just a little bit,it's a big bit.And it didn't even matter until I was 27.That's when I started writing songs, and even thenI only played them for myself.but physiologically, I couldn't do it.I had this irrational fear.But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced,the more I wanted to perform.So on the week of my 30th birthday,I decided I was going to go to this local open mic,and put this fear behind me.Well, when I got there, it was packed.There were like 20 people there.(Laughter)And they all looked angry.But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play,and I felt pretty good.Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn,your breathing gets faster.so your fingers don't work anymore.(Laughter)I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the differencebetween a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingerson a Tuesday night open mic?(Laughter)I have never been more terrified -- until now.(Laughter and cheers)So then it was my turn,I open my mouth to sing the first line,and this completely horrible vibrato --this is my whole body just convulsing with fear.I mean, it's a nightmare.they're focused on my discomfort.It was so bad.of that audience connection that I was hoping for.until I wasn't nervous anymore.And I did. I went back every single week,and sure enough, week after week,I couldn't shake it.And that's when I had an epiphany.That only seems authentic when I have stage fright,and the more nervous I was,the better the song would be. Easy.So I started writing a song about having stage fright.First, fessing up to the problem,the physical manifestations, how I would feel,how the listener might feel.And then accounting for things like my shaky voice,because I was nervous.while it was happening,that gave the audience permission to think about it.they could experience that with me,right in the beginning of a performance.with just a little bit more ease.(Applause)Can I have a sip of water?(Music)Thank you.♫ I'm not joking, you know, ♫♫ this stage fright is real. ♫♫ And if I'm up here trembling and singing, ♫♫ well, you'll know how I feel. ♫♫ And the mistake I'd be making, ♫♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. ♫♫ As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, ♫♫ well, you don't have to be. ♫♫ Well, maybe just a little bit. ♫(Laughter)♫ Not to discuss this at length, ♫♫ but my body image was never my strength. ♫♫ So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, ♫♫ I mean, you're not even really naked. ♫♫ And I'm the one with the problem. ♫♫ But I'm the one living with me ♫♫ and I know how I get. ♫♫ Your advice is gentle but late. ♫♫ If not just a bit patronizing. ♫♫ and if I wasn't ready to face this, ♫♫ I sure as hell wouldn't be here. ♫♫ But if I belt one note out clearly, ♫♫ you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. ♫♫ And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' ♫♫ my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. ♫♫ But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', ♫♫ my vocal cords movin', ♫♫ at speeds slightly faster than sound. ♫(Applause)

When I first saw Pixar's "Luxo Jr.,"into something as trivial as a desk lamp.(Laughter)So I made a really bad career decision.(Laughter)(Laughter)And there I livedAnyway, during the day, I went to schoolAnd I learned two surprising lessons.He actually did the weasel in "Ice Age."between humans and robots.they were all kind of robotic.(Laughter)So I went and designed frame by frameand I'm actually redesigning the robot,so, unbeknownst to itself,(Laughter)So you can see my confusion here.I'm not an actor.seem violent and confrontational.He was already dead!Just laying there, eyes glazed over!"(Laughter)I was studying the engineering,and at the same time,in the near future being there with us.It was after a Passover Seder.it all just happened.and more like a doerthat just clicks and works together.I decided to study acting for a semester.I actually participated in a play --(Laughter)the previous name was in 1889.(Laughter)to be rediscovered for robotics.And this book shows actorshow to move every muscle in the bodyAnd method acting saidimprovise, play off your scene partner.And this came at the same timeWe use our bodies to think;but our bodies feed back into our brainto generate the way that we behave.And it was like a lightning bolt.I went back to my office,And I even took another monthto do what was then the first theater playwith a human and a robot acting together.And I thought:a computer, computational model --of taking risks, of taking chances,even of making mistakes?Here you can see a very early exampleIt's sort of like a game.Let's look at it.when they try to mirror each otherto find the right synchrony between them.And then, I did another experiment,The robot is the same lamp that you saw,and I put two brains in it.For one half of the people,calculated robotic brain.Let's call it the calculated brain.Let's call it the adventurous brain.and they had to work together,somehow simulating, like, a factory jobof repetitively doing the same thing.They thought it was more intelligent,They even called it "he" and "she,"whereas people with the calculated brainWhatever that means.(Laughter)Sounds painful.said it was just like a lazy apprentice.about acting in the 19th century,And the marimba, for everybody like me,it was this huge, wooden xylophone.And when I was looking at this,The human would play,the robot analyzed what was played,and would improvise their own part.and in the teamwork studies,She said, when you improvise,but is still doing it.and improvises.to what the robot is doingand picking up from its behavior,(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)for the robot.it just expresses what the music is like.between my lab and my home.I think.(Laughter)this time with a socially expressive head.And notice one thing --how the robot is really showing usthe beat it's picking up from the human,And also how it changes the way it movesas soon as it starts its own solo.(Music)(Music)when it's busy doing its own thing,(Music)(Music ending)(Final chord)(Applause)Thanks.I hope you seeAnd at some point -- we are in Atlanta,Notice two things:And the reason is that we can't ignorephysical things moving in our environment.We are wired for that.So if you have a problem --(Laughter)(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)able to improvise and listen,(Laughter)they said "enjoying" the music.and I designed a new piece of furniture.And I thought,but would actually enjoy it, too?(Laughter)(Music)(Music ends)So, a lot of bobbing heads.(Applause)A lot of bobbing heads in the audience,And it's not just fun and games.I think one of the reasons I care so muchand use their body to move is --at some point in your life.If not in yours, your children's lives.than currently they seem to be.because in the end, we are human.are just perfect for us.Thank you.(Applause)

(Music)these shots might start to look familiar.This is Central Park,one of the most beautifully designedpublic spaces in America.But to anyone who hasn't visited,these images can't really fully convey.To really understand Central Park,you have to physically be there.Well, the same is true of the music,which my brother and I composed and mappedspecifically for Central Park.(Music)I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the workthat my brother Hays and I are doing --That's us there. That's both of us actually —this idea of location-aware music.Now, my brother and I, we're musiciansand music producers.We've been working together since,well, since we were kids, really.in projects where artand technology intersect,from creating sight-specific audioand video installationto engineering interactive concerts.But today I want to focus on this conceptof composition for physical space.But before I go too much further into that,let me tell you a little bit about how we got startedwith this idea.My brother and I were living in New York Citywhen the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claudedid their temporary installation, The Gates,in Central Park.Hundreds of these brightly-colored sculpturesdecorated the park for a number of weeks,and unlike work that's exhibitedin a more neutral space,like on the walls of a gallery or a museum,this was work that was really in dialoguewith this place,and in a lot of ways, The Gateswas really a celebrationof Frederick Olmsted's incredible design.This was an experience that stayed with usfor a long time, and years later,my brother and I moved back to Washington, D.C.,and we started to ask the question,would it be possible,in the same way that The Gatesresponded to the physical layout of the park,to compose music for a landscape?Which brought us to this.(Music)On Memorial Day, we released "The National Mall,"a location-aware albumreleased exclusively as a mobile appthat uses the device's built-in GPS functionalityto sonically map the entire parkin our hometown of Washington, D.C.Hundreds of musical segmentsare geo-tagged throughout the entire parkso that as a listener traverses the landscape,a musical score is actually unfolding around them.So this is not a playlist or a list of songsintended for the park,but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythmsthat fit together like pieces of a puzzleand blend seamlesslybased on a listener's chosen trajectory.So think of this asa choose-your-own-adventure of an album.Let's take a closer look.Let's look at one example here.So using the app,as you make your way towards the groundssurrounding the Washington Monument,you hear the sounds of instruments warming up,which then gives way to the sound of a mellotronspelling out a very simple melody.This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins.Keep walking, and a full choir joins in,until you finally reach the top of the hilland you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworksand all sorts of musical craziness,as if all of these sounds are radiating outfrom this giant obelisk that punctuatesthe center of the park.But were you to walk in the opposite direction,this entire sequence happens in reverse.the music would fade to silence,and the play button would disappear.who can't travel to the United States,but would like to hear this record.Well, unlike a normal album,we haven't been able to accommodate this request.When they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version,we just can't make that happen,and the reason is becausethis isn't a promotional appor a game to promote or accompanythe release of a traditional record.In this case, the app is the work itself,and the architecture of the landscapeis intrinsic to the listening experience.Six months later, we did a location-aware albumfor Central Park,with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadowto the Ramble to the Reservoir.Currently, my brother and I are working onprojects all over the country,but last spring we started a project,here actually at Stanford'sExperimental Media Art Department,one that will span the entirety of Highway 1here on the Pacific Coast.But what we're doing, integrating GPS with music,is really just one idea.But it speaks to a larger visionfor a music industry that's sometimes struggledto find its footing in this digital age,that they begin to see these new technologiesnot simply as ways of adding bells and whistlesto an existing model,but to dream up entirely new waysfor people to interact withand experience music.Thank you.(Applause)

Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.(Cheering)Not good enough.Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?(Loud cheering)My name is Maysoon Zayid,and I am not drunk,but the doctor who delivered me was.He cut my mom six different timesin six different directions,suffocating poor little me in the process.As a result, I have cerebral palsy,which means I shake all the time.Look.It's exhausting.(Laughter)CP is not genetic.No one put a curse on my mother's uterus,which they are.(Laughter)It only happens from accidents,like what happened to me on my birth day.Now, I must warn you,I'm not inspirational.(Laughter)because at some point in your life,you have dreamt of being disabled.Come on a journey with me.It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall,and what do you see?Sixteen empty handicapped spaces.(Laughter)(Laughter)Also, I've got to tell you,(Laughter)If there was an Oppression Olympics,I would win the gold medal.I'm Palestinian, Muslim,I'm female, I'm disabled,and I live in New Jersey.(Laughter)(Applause)(Laughter)Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.I have always loved the factI also love the factA lot of people with CP don't walk,but my parents didn't believe in "can't."My father's mantra was,"You can do it, yes you can can."(Laughter)I was mopping.my parents would sue the school systemand guarantee that I went too,and if we didn't all get A's,we all got my mother's slipper.(Laughter)by placing my heels on his feetand just walking.Another tactic that he usedand have me chase it.(Laughter)My inner stripper was very strong.(Laughter)Yeah.No, by the first day of kindergarten,I was walking like a champwho had been punched one too many times.(Laughter)and they were all my family.(Laughter)Now there are 20 Arabs in town,and they are still all my family.(Laughter)(Laughter)(Applause)This was before 9/11They did, however, seem very concernedto live off of for three whole months,(Laughter)I have tap-danced on Broadway.Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.(Applause)so they sent me to dancing school.I learned how to dance in heels,which means I can walk in heels.And I'm from Jersey,so if my friends wore heels, so did I.on the Jersey Shore, I did not.I spent my summers in a war zone,because my parents were afraidwe'd grow up to be Madonna.(Laughter)so I drank deer's milk,I had hot cups on my back,I was dunked in the Dead Sea,and I remember the water burning my eyes(Laughter)But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.I have to tell you, it's very boring,but before I did yoga,And now I can stand on my head.My parents reinforced this notionthat I could do anything,that no dream was impossible,and my dream was to be(Laughter)and got a sweet scholarship to ASU,Arizona State University,because I fit every single quota.(Laughter)Everybody loved me.I got A's in all of my classes,A's in all of their classes.(Laughter)my professors would weep.But I never got cast.Finally, my senior year,It's a play about a girl with CP.I was a girl with CP.So I start shouting from the rooftops,"I'm finally going to get a part!I have cerebral palsy!Free at last! Free at last!Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!"I didn't get the part.(Laughter)Sherry Brown got the part.to ask her why,neither can the character."(Laughter)(Applause)they gave it to a non-palsy actress.College was imitating life.Hollywood has a sordid historyUpon graduating, I moved back home,My dream was coming true.And I knew that I would be promoted(Laughter)and it became clear to methat casting directorsThey only hired perfect people.But there were exceptions to the rule.I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,Roseanne Barr, Ellen,they were comedians.So I became a comic.(Laughter)(Applause)My first gig was driving famous comicsfrom New York City to shows in New Jersey,with a chick with CP driving him.(Laughter)I've performed in clubs all over America,uncensored and uncovered.(Laughter)I never like to claim first,but I do know that they never heardand they find us hysterical.(Laughter)Dean Obeidallah and I startednow in its 10th year.while also reminding casting directors(Laughter)Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easierMy big break came in 2010."Countdown with Keith Olbermann."and they shuffle me into a studioand seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.(Laughter)So I looked at the stage managerAnd she looked at me and she went,"Five, four, three, two ..."And we were live, right?So I had to grip onto the anchor's deskand I knew I would never get invited back.he made me a full-time contributor,and he taped down my chair.(Laughter)(Applause)(Laughter)People say children are cruel,"Yo, why's she tweakin'?""Yo, is she retarded?"What does she suffer from?We should really pray for her."screenwriter, comedian, palsy.Disability is as visual as race.If a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé,then Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.The disabled are the largest —Yeah, clap for that, man. Come on.(Applause)The doctors said that I wouldn't walk,but I am here in front of you.However, if I grew up with social media,I don't think I would be.I hope that together,we can create more positive imagesit would foster less hate on the Internet.Or maybe not.I got to walk the red carpetflanked by soap diva Susan Lucciand the iconic Loreen Arbus.I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandlerat the 2008 DNC.And I founded Maysoon's Kids,a sliver of the chance my parents gave me.was when I got -- before this moment --(Laughter)(Applause)was when I got to performfor the man who floats like a butterflyand stings like a bee,has Parkinson's and shakes just like me,Muhammad Ali.(Applause)(Applause ends)and I dedicate this talk to his memory.(Arabic) Allah yerhamak yaba.(English) My name is Maysoon Zayid,and if I can can, you can can.(Cheering)(Applause)

So when I do my job, people hate me.In fact, the better I do my job,the more people hate me.And no, I'm not a meter maid,and I'm not an undertaker.I am a progressive lesbian talking headon Fox News. (Applause)So y'all heard that, right? Just to make sure, right?I am a gay talking head on Fox News.I am going to tell you how I do itand the most important thing I've learned.So I go on television.I debate people who literally want to obliterateeverything I believe in, in some cases,who don't want me and people like me to even exist.on steroids,with a live television audience of millions.It's totally almost just like that.And that's just on air.The hate mail I get is unbelievable.Last week alone, I got 238 pieces of nasty emailand more hate tweets than I can even count.I was called an idiot, a traitor, a scourge,a cunt, and an ugly man,and that was just in one email.(Laughter)So what have I realized,being on the receiving end of all this ugliness?Well, my biggest takeaway is that for decades,we've been focused on political correctness,but what matters more is emotional correctness.Let me give you a small example.I don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't.I care about two things.One, I care that you spell it right.(Laughter) (Applause)Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.You'd totally be surprised.And second, I don't care about the word,I care about how you use it.Are you being friendly? Are you just being naive?Or do you really want to hurt me personally?Emotional correctness is the tone, the feeling,how we say what we say,the respect and compassion we show one another.And what I've realized is that political persuasiondoesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.So when I first went to go work at Fox News,true confession,I expected there to be marks in the carpetfrom all the knuckle-dragging.But liberals on my side,In other words, we can be politically rightbut emotionally wrong.And incidentally, that means thatpeople don't like us. Right?Now here's the kicker.Conservatives are really nice.I mean, not all of them,and not the ones who send me hate mail,but you would be surprised.Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guysI've ever met.He spends his free timetrying to fix up his staff on blind dates,and I know that if I ever had a problem,he would do anything he could to help.Now, I think Sean Hannity is99 percent politically wrong,and that's why people listen to him.Because you can't get anyone to agree with youif they don't even listen to you first.We spend so much time talking past each otherthen we have a shot at building common ground.It actually sounds really hokeyto say it standing up here,but when you try to put it in practice,it's really powerful.So someone who says they hate immigrants,I try to imagine how scared they must beI bet they're really devastated to seetheir kid's school going into the gutter,and they're just looking for someone to blame.Our challenge is to find the compassion for othersthat we want them to have for us.That is emotional correctness.I'm not saying it's easy.An average of, like, 5.6 times per dayI have to stop myself from respondingto all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities.This whole finding compassionand common ground with your enemies thingis kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me,and I ain't the Dalai Lama.I'm not perfect, but what I am is optimistic,because I don't just get hate mail.I get a lot of really nice letters, lots of them.And one of my all-time favorites begins,"I am not a big fan of your political leaningsor your sometimes tortured logic,but I'm a big fan of you as a person."Now this guy doesn't agree with me, yet.(Laughter)But he's listening, not because of what I said,but because of how I said it,and somehow, even though we've never met,we've managed to form a connection.That's emotional correctness,and that's how we start the conversationsthat really lead to change.Thank you.(Applause)



jane_mcgonigal_massively_multi_player_thumb_wrestling

Today I am going to teach youhow to play my favorite game:massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.It's the only game in the world that I know ofthat allows you, the player,the opportunity to experience10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less.This is true, so if you play this game with me todayfor just one single minute,you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise,pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder,contentment, and creativity,all in the span of one minute.In order to teach you this game,I'm going to need some volunteersto come up onstage really quickly,and we're going to do a little hands-on demo.While they're coming up, I should let you know,this game was invented 10 years agoby an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom.So thank you, Monochrom.Okay, so most people are familiarwith traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling.Sunni, let's just remind them.we're the gamer generation.There are a billion gamers on the planet now,so we need more of a challenge.So the first thing we need is more thumbs.So Eric, come on over.So we could get three thumbs together,and Peter could join us.We could even have four thumbs together,and the way you winThis is really important. You can't, like,That is not how you win.Ah, who did that? Eric you did that.Okay, so that's the first rule,and we can see that three or fouris kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node,We can really go for it.So you can see up here.Now the only other rule you need to remember is,gamer generation, we like a challenge.I happen to notice you all havesome thumbs you're not using.So I think we should kind of get some more involved.And if we had just four people,we would do it just like this,and we would try and wrestleboth thumbs at the same time.Perfect.Now, if we had more people in the room,instead of just wrestling in a closed node,And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.We're going to try and get all, something like,I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this roomconnected in a single node.And we have to connect both levels,so if you're up there, you're going to bereaching down and reaching up.Now — (Laughter) —before we get started --This is great. You're excited to play. —because if you get good at this game,I want you to know there are some advanced levels.So this is the kind of simple level, right?But there are advanced configurations.This is called the Death Star Configuration.Any Star Wars fans?And this one's called the Möbius Strip.Any science geeks, you get that one.This is the hardest level. This is the extreme.So we'll stick with the normal one for now,and I'm going to give you 30 seconds,every thumb into the node,connect the upper and the lower levels,you guys go on down there.Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node.Stand up! It's easier if you stand up.Everybody, up up up up up!Stand up, my friends.All right.Don't start wrestling yet.If you have a free thumb, wave it around,make sure it gets connected.Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check.Grab that thumb!Reach behind you. There you go.Any other thumbs?Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go.Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it.Okay? One, two, three, go!(Laughter)Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent!(Applause)Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much.All right.While you are basking in the glowof having won your firstmassively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game,let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions.So curiosity.I said "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."You were like, "What the hell is she talking about?"So I provoked a little curiosity.Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problemof getting all the thumbs into the node.I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up.So you used creativity. That was great.How about surprise? The actual feelingYou heard that sound go up in the room.We had excitement. As you started to wrestle,so you kind of get the excitement going.We have relief. You got to stand up.You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief,getting to shake it out.We had some contentment.so you were totally content to be playing.The most important three emotions,When was the last time you were at TEDAnd it's truly awesome and wondrous.And speaking of physical connection,you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin,so we are all now biochemically primedto love each other. That is great.And the last emotion of pride.How many people are like me. Just admit it.You lost both your thumbs.It just didn't work out for you.That's okay, because you learned a new skill today.So congratulations.How many of you won just won thumb?All right. I have very good news for you.According to the official rulesof massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,this makes you a grandmaster of the game.we have to kind of accelerate the programmore than a game like chess.So congratulations, grandmasters.Did anybody win both their thumbs?Yes. Awesome. Okay.Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status.You guys, according to the rules,are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations.The best way to become a legendary grandmaster,you've got your two nodes going on.Pick off the one that looks easiest.They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak.Focus on that one and do something crazywith this arm.As soon as you win, suddenly stop.Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill.Wooo! (Applause)Thank you. (Applause)



arthur_benjamin_the_magic_of_fibonacci_numbers

So why do we learn mathematics?Essentially, for three reasons:calculation,application,and last, and unfortunately leastin terms of the time we give it,inspiration.Mathematics is the science of patterns,and we study it to learn how to think logically,critically and creatively,is not effectively motivated,and when our students ask,"Why are we learning this?"then they often hear that they'll need itin an upcoming math class or on a future test.But wouldn't it be greatif every once in a while we did mathematicssimply because it was fun or beautifulor because it excited the mind?Now, I know many people have nothad the opportunity to see how this can happen,so let me give you a quick examplewith my favorite collection of numbers,the Fibonacci numbers. (Applause)Yeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here.That's great.Now these numbers can be appreciatedin many different ways.From the standpoint of calculation,they're as easy to understandas one plus one, which is two.Then one plus two is three,two plus three is five, three plus five is eight,and so on.Indeed, the person we call Fibonacciwas actually named Leonardo of Pisa,and these numbers appear in his book "Liber Abaci,"which taught the Western worldthe methods of arithmetic that we use today.In terms of applications,Fibonacci numbers appear in naturesurprisingly often.The number of petals on a floweris typically a Fibonacci number,or the number of spirals on a sunfloweror a pineappletends to be a Fibonacci number as well.but what I find most inspirational about themare the beautiful number patterns they display.Let me show you one of my favorites.Suppose you like to square numbers,and frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter)Let's look at the squaresof the first few Fibonacci numbers.So one squared is one,two squared is four, three squared is nine,five squared is 25, and so on.Now, it's no surprisethat when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers,you get the next Fibonacci number. Right?That's how they're created.But you wouldn't expect anything specialto happen when you add the squares together.But check this out.One plus one gives us two,and one plus four gives us five.And four plus nine is 13,nine plus 25 is 34,and yes, the pattern continues.In fact, here's another one.Suppose you wanted to look atLet's see what we get there.So one plus one plus four is six.Add nine to that, we get 15.Add 25, we get 40.Add 64, we get 104.Now look at those numbers.Those are not Fibonacci numbers,but if you look at them closely,you'll see the Fibonacci numbersburied inside of them.Do you see it? I'll show it to you.Six is two times three, 15 is three times five,40 is five times eight,two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate?(Laughter)Fibonacci! Of course.Now, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns,it's even more satisfying to understandwhy they are true.Let's look at that last equation.add up to eight times 13?I'll show you by drawing a simple picture.We'll start with a one-by-one squareand next to that put another one-by-one square.Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle.Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square,and next to that, a three-by-three square,beneath that, a five-by-five square,and then an eight-by-eight square,creating one giant rectangle, right?Now let me ask you a simple question:what is the area of the rectangle?Well, on the one hand,it's the sum of the areasof the squares inside it, right?Just as we created it.It's one squared plus one squaredplus two squared plus three squaredplus five squared plus eight squared. Right?That's the area.On the other hand, because it's a rectangle,the area is equal to its height times its base,and the height is clearly eight,and the base is five plus eight,which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right?So the area is also eight times 13.Since we've correctly calculated the areatwo different ways,they have to be the same number,add up to eight times 13.Now, if we continue this process,we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21,21 by 34, and so on.Now check this out.If you divide 13 by eight,you get 1.625.then these ratios get closer and closerto about 1.618,known to many people as the Golden Ratio,a number which has fascinated mathematicians,scientists and artists for centuries.Now, I show all this to you because,like so much of mathematics,there's a beautiful side to itthat I fear does not get enough attentionin our schools.We spend lots of time learning about calculation,but let's not forget about application,learning how to think.If I could summarize this in one sentence,it would be this:Mathematics is not just solving for x,it's also figuring out why.Thank you very much.(Applause)

I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,and this little white dog called Mauiwas staying with me.Half the city was dark because of a power cut,and I was living on the dark side.Now, Maui was terrified of the dark,so I had to carry him up the stairs,actually down the stairs first, for his walk,and then bring him back up.I was also hauling gallons of bottles of waterup to the seventh floor every day.And through all of this,I had to hold a torch between my teeth.The stores nearby were out of flashlightsand batteries and bread.For a shower, I walked 40 blocksto a branch of my gym.But these were not the major preoccupations of my day.It was just as critical for me to be the first person inat a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargersto juice my multiple devices.I started to prospect under the benches of bakeriesand the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.I wasn't the only one.Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenueunder their umbrellas charging their cell phonesfrom outlets on the street.Nature had just reminded usthat it was stronger than all our technology,and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.I think there's nothing like a crisisto tell you what's really important and what's not,and Sandy made me realize that our devicesand their connectivity matter to usright up there with food and shelter.The self as we once knew it no longer exists,and I think that an abstract, digital universehas become a part of our identity,and I want to talk to you about what I think that means.I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the selfbecause the self and fiction have a lot in common.They're both stories, interpretations.You and I can experience things without a story.We might run up the stairs too quicklyand we might get breathless.But the larger sense that we have of our lives,the slightly more abstract one, is indirect.Our story of our life is based on direct experience,but it's embellished.A novel needs scene after scene to build,and the story of our life needs an arc as well.It needs months and years.Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters.But the story is not about these chapters.It's the whole book.It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness,the victories and the disappointments,but it's because how because of these,and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these,we find our place in the worldand we change it and we change ourselves.Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time:a long arc of time that is our lifespan,and the timeframe of direct experiencethat is the moment.Now the self that experiences directlycan only exist in the moment,but the one that narrates needs several moments,a whole sequence of them,and that's why our full sense of selfneeds both immersive experienceand the flow of time.Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything,in the erosion of a grain of sand,in the budding of a little bud into a rose.Without it, we would have no music.Our own emotions and state of mindoften encode time,regret or nostalgia about the past,hope or dread about the future.I think that technology has altered that flow of time.The overall time that we have for our narrative,our lifespan, has been increasing,but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk.It has shrunk because our instruments enable usin part to measure smaller and smaller units of time,and this in turn has given us a more granular understandingof the material world,and this granular understandinghas generated reams of datathat our brains can no longer comprehendand for which we need more and more complicated computers.All of this to say that the gapbetween what we can perceive and what we can measureis only going to widen.Science can do things with and in a picosecond,but you and I are never going to have the inner experienceof a millionth of a millionth of a second.You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow,to the sun, the moon and the seasons,and this is why we need that long arc of timewith the past, the present and the futureto see things for what they are,to separate signal from noiseand the self from sensations.We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect,not just in the material world,but in our own intentions and our motivations.What happens when that arrow goes awry?What happens when time warps?So many of us today have the sensationthat time's arrow is pointing everywhereand nowhere at once.This is because time doesn't flow in the digital worldin the same way that it does in the natural one.We all know that the Internet has shrunk spaceas well as time.Far away over there is now here.News from India is a stream on my smartphone appwhether I'm in New York or New Delhi.And that's not all.Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year,your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends,because the Internet also archives,and it warps the past.With no distinction left between the past,the present and the future, and the here or there,we are left with this moment everywhere,this moment that I'll call the digital now.Just how can we prioritizein the landscape of the digital now?This digital now is not the present,because it's always a few seconds ahead,with Twitter streams that are already trendingand news from other time zones.This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your footor the second that you bite into a pastryor the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book.This now bears very little physicalor psychological reference to our own state.Its focus, instead, is to distract usat every turn on the road.Every digital landmark is an invitationto leave what you are doing now to go somewhere elseand do something else.Are you reading an interview by an author?Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.Like it. Find other books exactly like his.Find other people reading those books.Travel can be liberating,but when it is incessant, we becomepermanent exiles without repose.Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantlyfor its own sake.Not just is the digital now far from the present,but it's in direct competition with it,and this is because not just am I absent from it,but so are you.Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else.And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night,shop for Parisian macarons,and leave video messages that get picked up later.At all times, I can operateat a different rhythm and pace from you,while I sustain the illusionthat I'm tapped into you in real time.Sandy was a reminderof how such an illusion can shatter.There were those with power and water,and those without.There are those who went back to their lives,and those who are still displacedafter so many months.For some reason, technology seems to perpetuatethe illusion for those who have it that everyone does,and then, like an ironic slap in the face,it makes it true.For example, it's said that there are more peoplein India with access to cell phones than toilets.Now if this rift, which is already so greatin many parts of the world,between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology,isn't somehow bridged,there will be ruptures between the digitaland the real.For us as individuals who live in the digital nowand spend most of our waking moments in it,the challenge is to live in two streams of timethat are parallel and almost simultaneous.How does one live inside distraction?We might think that those younger than us,those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.Possibly, but I remember my childhood.I remember my grandfather revisingthe capitals of the world with me.Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube,and Vienna had a Spanish riding school.If I were a child today, I could easily learn this informationwith apps and hyperlinks,but it really wouldn't be the same,because much later, I went to Vienna,and I went to the Spanish riding school,and I could feel my grandfather right beside me.Night after night, he took me up on the terrace,on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiterand Saturn and the Great Bear to me.And even here, when I look at the Great Bear,I get back that feeling of being a child,hanging onto his head and trying to balance myselfon his shoulder,and I can get back that feeling of being a child again.What I had with my grandfather was wrappedso often in information and knowledge and fact,but it was about so much morethan information or knowledge or fact.Time-warping technology challengesour deepest core,because we are able to archive the pastand some of it becomes hard to forget,even as the current momentis increasingly unmemorable.We want to clutch, and we are left insteadclutching at a series of static moments.They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.By archiving everything, we think that we can store it,but time is not data.It cannot be stored.You and I know exactly what it means liketo be truly present in a moment.It might have happened while we wereplaying an instrument,or looking into the eyes of someone we've knownfor a very long time.At such moments, our selves are complete.The self that lives in the long narrative arcand the self that experiences the momentbecome one.The present encapsulates the pastand a promise for the future.The present joins a flow of timefrom before and after.I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old ropeand she tucked up her sariand she jumped over it.I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen,cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.My grandmother taught me that things happenin the time they take, that time can't be fought,and because it will pass and it will move,we owe the present moment our full attention.Attention is time.One of my yoga instructors once saidthat love is attention,and definitely from my grandmother,love and attention were one and the same thing.The digital world cannibalizes time,and in doing so, I want to suggestthat what it threatensis the completeness of ourselves.It threatens the flow of love.But we don't need to let it.We can choose otherwise.We've seen again and againjust how creative technology can be,and in our lives and in our actions,we can choose those solutions and those innovationsand those moments that restore the flow of timeinstead of fragmenting it.We can slow down and we can tune into the ebb and flow of time.We can choose to take time back.Thank you.(Applause)



malcolm_gladwell_the_unheard_story_of_david_and_goliath
2912993

So I wanted to tell a storythat really obsessed me when I was writing my new book,and it's a story of something that happened3,000 years ago,when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.And it takes place in an area called the Shephelahin what is now Israel.And the reason the story obsessed me is thatI thought I understood it, and then I went back over itand I realized that I didn't understand it at all.Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border,there's a mountain range.Still same is true of Israel today.And in the mountain range are all of the ancient citiesof that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.And then there's a coastal plainalong the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plainis an area called the Shephelah,which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west,and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelahto get from the coastal plain to the mountains.And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll knowit's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.It's gorgeous, with forests of oakand wheat fields and vineyards.But more importantly, though, in the history of that region,it's served, it's had a real strategic function,and that is, it is the means by which hostile armieson the coastal plain find their way,get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.And 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemiesof the Kingdom of Israel,are living in the coastal plain.They're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people.And they may start to make their waythrough one of the valleys of the Shephelahup into the mountains,because what they want to do is occupy the highland arearight by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul,obviously catches wind of this,and Saul brings his army down from the mountainsand he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah,one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge,and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge,and the two armies just sit there for weeksand stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other sideyou've got to come down the mountain into the valleyand then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.So finally, to break the deadlock,the Philistines send their mightiest warriordown into the valley floor, and he calls outand he says to the Israelites,"Send your mightiest warrior down,and we'll have this out, just the two of us."This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.It was a way of settling disputeswithout incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.And the Philistine who is sent down,their mighty warrior, is a giant.He's 6 foot 9.He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor,and he's got a sword and he's got a javelinand he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying.And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.It's a death wish, right? There's no way they think they can take him.And finally the only person who will come forwardis this young shepherd boy,and he goes up to Saul and he says, "I'll fight him."And Saul says, "You can't fight him. That's ridiculous.You're this kid. This is this mighty warrior."But the shepherd is adamant. He says, "No, no, no,you don't understand, I have been defending my flockagainst lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it."And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward.So he says, "All right."And then he turns to the kid, and he says,"But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are."So he tries to give the shepherd his armor,and the shepherd says, "No."He says, "I can't wear this stuff."The Biblical verse is, "I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,"meaning, "I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy."So he reaches down instead on the groundand picks up five stonesand puts them in his shepherd's bagand starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.And the giant sees this figure approaching,and calls out, "Come to me so I can feed your fleshto the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field."He issues this kind of taunt towards this personcoming to fight him.And the shepherd draws closer and closer,and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.That's all he's carrying.Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff,and he says -- he's insulted --"Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?"And the shepherd boy takes one of his stonesout of his pocket, puts it in his slingand rolls it around and lets it flyand it hits the giant right between the eyes --right here, in his most vulnerable spot --and he falls down either dead or unconscious,and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his swordand cuts off his head,and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run.And of course, the name of the giant is Goliathand the name of the shepherd boy is David,and the reason that story has obsessed meover the course of writing my bookis that everything I thought I knew about that storyturned out to be wrong.So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?In fact, that term, David and Goliath,has entered our language as a metaphor forimprobable victoriesby some weak party over someone far stronger.Now why do we call David an underdog?Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid,a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.We also call him an underdogbecause Goliath is an experienced warrior,and David is just a shepherd.But most importantly, we call him an underdogbecause all he has is -- it's that Goliath is outfitted withall of this modern weaponry,this glittering coat of armorand a sword and a javelin and a spear,and all David has is this sling.Well, let's start there with the phrase"All David has is this sling,"because that's the first mistake that we make.In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers,armed foot soldiers with swords and shieldsand some kind of armor.And there's artillery, and artillery are archers,but, more importantly, slingers.And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouchwith two long cords attached to it,and they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball,inside the pouch, and they whirl it around like thisand they let one of the cords go,and the effect is to send the projectile forwardtowards its target.That's what David has, and it's important to understandthat that sling is not a slingshot.It's not this, right? It's not a child's toy.It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.When David rolls it around like this,he's turning the sling around probablyat six or seven revolutions per second,and that means that when the rock is released,it's going forward really fast,probably 35 meters per second.That's substantially faster than a baseballthrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elahwere not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate,which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.If you do the calculations on the ballistics,on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling,it's roughly equal to the stopping powerof a [.45 caliber] handgun.This is an incredibly devastating weapon.Accuracy, we know from historical recordsthat slingers -- experienced slingers could hitand maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.From medieval tapestries, we know that slingerswere capable of hitting birds in flight.They were incredibly accurate.When David lines up -- and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath,he's quite close to Goliath --when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath,he has every intention and every expectationof being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spotbetween his eyes.If you go back over the history of ancient warfare,you will find time and time againthat slingers were the decisive factor against infantryin one kind of battle or another.So what's Goliath? He's heavy infantry,and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duelis that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.When he says, "Come to me that I mightfeed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"the key phrase is "Come to me."Come up to me because we're going to fight,hand to hand, like this.Saul has the same expectation.David says, "I want to fight Goliath,"and Saul tries to give him his armor,because Saul is thinking, "Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,'you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,'infantry on infantry."But David has absolutely no expectation.He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he?He's a shepherd. He's spent his entire careerusing a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.That's where his strength lies.So here he is, this shepherd, experiencedin the use of a devastating weapon,up against this lumbering giantweighed down by a hundred pounds of armorand these incredibly heavy weaponsthat are useful only in short-range combat.Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance.So why do we keep calling David an underdog,and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?There's a second piece of this that's important.It's not just that we misunderstand Davidand his choice of weaponry.It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.Goliath is not what he seems to be.There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text,things that are in retrospect quite puzzlingand don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.So to begin with, the Bible says that Goliathis led onto the valley floor by an attendant.Now that is weird, right?Here is this mighty warriorchallenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.Why is he being led by the handby some young boy, presumably,to the point of combat?Secondly, the Bible story makes special noteof how slowly Goliath moves,another odd thing to say when you're describingthe mightiest warrior known to man at that point.And then there's this whole weird thingabout how long it takes Goliath to reactto the sight of David.So David's coming down the mountain,and he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.There is nothing about him that says,"I am about to fight you like this."He's not even carrying a sword.Why does Goliath not react to that?It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day.And then there's that strange comment he makes to David:"Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"Sticks? David only has one stick.Well, it turns out that there's been a great dealof speculation within the medical community over the yearsabout whether there is somethingfundamentally wrong with Goliath,an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.There have been many articles written.The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal,and it started a chain of speculationthat starts with an explanation for Goliath's height.So Goliath is head and shoulders aboveall of his peers in that era,and usually when someone is that far out of the norm,there's an explanation for it.So the most common form of giantismis a condition called acromegaly,and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumoron your pituitary glandthat causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.And throughout history, many of the most famous giantshave all had acromegaly.So the tallest person of all timewas a guy named Robert Wadlowwho was still growing when he died at the age of 24and he was 8 foot 11.He had acromegaly.Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant?Famous. He had acromegaly.There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.Anyone who's unusually tall,that's the first explanation we come up with.And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effectsassociated with it,principally having to do with vision.The pituitary tumor, as it grows,often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain,with the result that people with acromegalyhave either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.So when people have started to speculateabout what might have been wrong with Goliath,they've said, "Wait a minute,he looks and sounds an awful lot like someonewho has acromegaly."And that would also explain so much of what was strangeabout his behavior that day.Why does he move so slowlyand have to be escorted down into the valley floorby an attendant?Because he can't make his way on his own.Why is he so strangely oblivious to Davidthat he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight himuntil the very last moment?Because he can't see him.When he says, "Come to me that I might feed your fleshto the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"the phrase "come to me" is a hint also of his vulnerability.Come to me because I can't see you.And then there's, "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"He sees two sticks when David has only one.So the Israelites up on the mountain ridgelooking down on him thought he wasthis extraordinarily powerful foe.What they didn't understand was thatthe very thing that was the source of his apparent strengthwas also the source of his greatest weakness.And there is, I think, in that,a very important lesson for all of us.Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.Thank you.(Applause)

I think those are interesting ideas.picking pockets.When we think of misdirection,are often the hardest to see,Great. Double-check.Make sure you still have them.I was doing some shopping before.(Laughter)You've looked at them a few times today,but I'll ask you a question.Without looking at it directly yet,How'd you do?Show of hands. Did we get it?Now that you're done, close them down.Every phone has something in common.No matter how you organize the icons,you still have a clock on the front.You just looked at your clock, right?Interesting idea.Close your eyes.With your eyes closed, what am I wearing?Make your best guess.Now open your eyes.Show of hands, were you right?Interesting, isn't it?For me, I like to call him Frank.So Frank is sitting at a desk.high-tech equipment, he's got cameras,all these senses, all these perceptions.it's what controls your reality.It's the gateway to the mind.For example, the cocktail effect:and yet you can recognize your nameNow, instead of doing it like misdirectionand throwing it off to the side,your security guard,just to go internal for a second.What just happened? Do you have a wallet?This sounds like a good theory,and a portion of them may be true,Just hold still where you are.Wonderful job onstage.Do you have a ring as well?Hi, how are you? Good to see you.Nice to meet you, sir.Hi, sir, how are you?Do you have a wallet on you? Joe: I don't.(Applause)AR: Pardon me.I don't think I need this clicker anymore.Thank you very much. I appreciate that.Anything in your front pockets?J: Money.AR: Money! All right, let's try that.Can you stand right over this way for me?Turn around and, let's see,this is just something I have,a poker chip.Hold out your hand for me.Watch it closely.This is a task for you to focus on.You have your money in your front pocket?Once a guy had a hole in his pocket,and that was rather traumatizing for me.Big miscommunication.(Laughter)Do you feel the poker chip in your hand?J: I do.Open your hand. Thank you very much.I'll cheat if you give me a chance.Make it harder for me. Just use your hand.Grab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm.Did you see it go? Joe: No.AR: No, it's not here. Open your hand.Go ahead and take it off.Now, let's try that again.Hold your hand out flat. Open it up.(Laughter)It's back on your shoulder.You were focused on your hand, distracted.Yet you had something inside your pocket.Do you remember what it was?J: Money.AR: Check your pocket. Is it still there?(Laughter)Oh, there it was. Put it away.We're just shopping.This trick's more about the timing.Put your other hand on top, would you?It's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?(Laughter) (Applause)(Applause)If you're watching this little token,It's not back on your shoulder.Did you see it go?Is it in this pocket, sir?(Squeaking)I need help with this one.Step over this way for me.but I noticed you had something here.Can I feel the outside for a moment?I have no idea. That's a shrimp.J: Yeah. I'm saving it for later.better than you know.(Laughter)Hopefully it matches his taste.We have a couple of other things,a little bit of cash.And we have a few other things,these all belong to you,(Applause)Joe, thank you very much.(Applause)(Applause ends)So, same question I asked you before,What am I wearing?Audience: Oh!(Laughter)(Hesitant applause)(Applause ends)Attention is a powerful thing.Like I said, it shapes your reality.If you could control somebody's attention,what would you do with it?Thank you.(Applause)

(Music)["Oedipus Rex"]["The Lion King"]["Titus"]["Frida"]["The Magic Flute"]["Across The Universe"](Applause)That's a few samples of the theater, operaBut what I'd like to begin with right nowis to take you back to a momentthat I went through in Indonesia,which is a seminal moment in my lifeand, like all myths,these stories need to be retoldand told, lest we forget them.that I am right now, through the crucibleand the fire of transformation,which is what all of you do, actually.(Laughter)And I am right there on the edge,which I'll tell you about, another story.I want to go back to Indonesiaon a fellowship.And I found myself, after two years thereon the edge of a crater, Gunung Batur.And I was in a village where there wasan initiation ceremony for the young men,a rite of passage.And as I sat in this temple squareunder this gigantic beringin banyan tree,down in this empty square,and I heard the most beautiful sounds,like a Charles Ives concertas I listened to the gamelan musicfrom all the different villagers that camefor this once-every-five-years ceremony.And all of a sudden, out of the dark,from the other end of the square,And these 20 old men who I'd seen beforewith the headdress and the spears,No one was there, and they came out,and they did this incredible dance."Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha."and the lights bounced off these costumes.and performing, creating, and I went,"Who are they performing forwith these elaborate costumes,these extraordinary headdresses?"whatever that means.There was no money involved.And there were these incredible artistsThe next moment,hung it up on a tree, set up a curtain.And they put on an opera all night long.Human beings needed the light.They needed the light to see.was that you must be truebut you also have to be awareand they also need the light.And it's this incredible balancethat I think that we walkthat imaginary worldthat I have walked my whole life.What I would like to do now is to tell youa little bitYou saw many examples of my work up there,but it's one that people know.I start with the notion of the ideograph.I go to the concept of "The Lion King"and I say, "What is the essence of it?What is the abstraction?If I were to reduce this entire storyinto one image, what would it be?"The circle. The circle. It's so obvious.how do you express drought?It's a circle of silk on the floorThe circle of life comes in the wheelsof the gazelles that leap.And you see the mechanics.is that when the audience comes inand they suspend their disbelief,when you see men walking or women walkingwith a platter of grass on their heads,you know it's the savanna.You don't question that.I love the apparent truth of theater.The audience is willing to say,"Oh, I know that's not a real sun.You took pieces of sticks.You added silk to the bottom.That's what moves you.It's the art of it.and the book and the language,the telling of the story, how it's told,the mechanics, the methods that you use,is equal to the story itself.So I could go from --But the fact is, without the dancerit's nothing.So now I'm going to show you"The Tempest."in the theater since 1984, '86,and I love the play.I did it always with a male Prospero.And all of a sudden, I thought,from "The Tempest."(Music)Miranda: Do you love me?Ferdinand: Beyond all limit.HM: They are both in either's powers.(Music)Looking for business, governor?Prospera: Caliban!Caliban: This island is mine.Sebastian: Draw thy sword.And I, the king, shall love thee.Ariel: I have made you mad.(Music)JT: Okay.(Applause)many years ago,and I love the play, and I also thinkit's Shakespeare's last play,how one stages it in theaterand moves it into cinema.what is it for "The Tempest"?What, if I were to boil it down,would be the one image that I couldhang my hat on for this?And it was the sand castle,the idea of nurture versus nature,that we build these civilizations --and there will -- leave not a rack behind.So in the theater, I started the play,it was a black sand rake, white cyc,building a drip castle, a sand castle.two stagehands all in blackwith watering cans ran along the topbut before it did,But as they started to pour the water,it focused right on the water itself.It becomes something magically large.It becomes the rainstorm.Now the differencewhen I went and did it in the cinema,I started the actual movieand what cinema can do is,by using camera, perspective,and also long shots and close-ups,and as it pulled away,of the girl's hands.And so I could play with the medium,and why I move from one medium to anotheris to be able to do this.Now I'm going to take you to "Spider-Man."(Music)I can soar away from this. ♪that you can't do in two dimensionsin film and television.Spider Man is not bound by gravity.PP: ♪ Be yourself and rise above it all. ♪Ensemble: ♪ Sock!

What was that?Circus, rock 'n' roll, drama.Well, one last story, very quickly.and I saw that the volcano was eruptingon the other side, Gunung Batur,and I am here.But it's very easy to climb up, is it not?You hold on to the roots,you put your foot in the little rocksand we said, "Let's go up there.Let's see if we can come close to the edgeof that live volcano."and we're on the edge, on this precipice,Roland disappears into the sulfur smokeat the volcano at the other end,and I'm up there aloneon this incredible precipice.Did you hear the lyrics?I'm on the precipice looking downinto a dead volcano to my left.And no hiking boots.off in the smoke, and I realize,and I got down on all fours like a cat,and I held with my knees to either sideof this line in front of me,for 30 yards or 30 feet, I don't know.The wind was massively blowing,I know you've all been there.I'm in the crucible right now.It's my trial by fire.It's my company's trials by fire.Boy falls from the sky, rise above.of all of my company's hands.only get there all together.I know you understand that.And you just stay going forward,and then you see this extraordinary thingin front of your eyes.Thank you.(Applause)

I love paper, and I love technology,and what I do is I make paper interactive.but it really confuses most people,is to take the technology and be creativeand create experiences.that I wanted to print two DJ decksand to try and mix some music.And I'm not a DJ, and I'm not a musician,so I'm a little bit scared of that.is just to mention a few little thingsand I'll just describe those first,and then talk about some of my work.and I used to thread them under my carpetand thread them behind the wallsbut kind of all hidden away.to make a radio transmitter,and I hid it inside there,and then I placed it next to my dadso I could eavesdrop.It's more that I just liked the ideaof an everyday objecthaving something insideand doing something different.Several year later,and my parents, maybe as a reward,bought me what turned out to bea one-way ticket to Australia,It was in far western New South Wales.And this farm was 120,000 acres.There were 22,000 sheep,and it was about 40 degrees,or 100 or so Fahrenheit.and there was the four-year-old daughter.And they kind of took me into the farmAnd we'd do that by building fences,using motorbikes and horses,And what I learned was,although at the time, like everyone else,I thought sheep were pretty stupidSo the challenge was to try and get themto do what we wanted them to doand go where we wanted them to go.Another bunch of years later,I ended up at Cambridge Universityat the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K.doing a Ph.D. in physics.looking back as to what I did —as moving sheep around.It really is.that you can't act on any object.So we made it very small,And I wanted to go one step further,and I wanted to move one electron onand one electron off.that's the thing that makes you do it.And a lot of that learning, I think,came from being on that farm,because when I was working on the farm,we'd have to use what was around us,we'd have to use the environment,and there was no such thingas something can't be done,because you're in an environment where,if you can't do what you need to do,you can die, and, you know,I had seen that sort of thing happen.So now my obsession is printing,and I'm really fascinated by the ideaof using conventional printing processes,many of the things around usto make paper and card interactive.and told them what I wanted to do,they told me it couldn't be done,again, that kind of favorite thing.So I got about 10 credit cards and loanswhich I had no idea how to use at all.It was about five meters long,That's always the case.we make conductive inks,through pieces of paperso we can make that paper interactive.And it's pretty simple, really.one to run some capacitive touch software,so we know where we've touched it,and the other to run, quite often,This is one of them, because I love cake.And this one, it's a large poster,and asks you a series of questions,and it works out your perfect cake.It uploads a picture,to our Facebook page and to Twitter.So we're trying to create that connectionbetween the physical and the digital,but have it not looking on a screen,and just looking like a regular poster.looking at interactive newsprint.So for example, we've created a newspaper,a regular newspaper.You can hear a press conferencethat press conference was about.And you can press a Facebook "like" buttonor you can vote on something as well.Something else that we created,and so we've done a project on this.It was for funding from the governmentAnd we wanted to try and encourage peopleto use energy better.and reading things to say --looking at your energy usage,and had color-changing inks on it,and all would be good.And if it wasn't, then there'd be graffitiand the leaves would fall off the trees.in your immediate environment,rather than expecting people to do thingsthat it has a long way off.Okay.So this is the bit I'm really scared of.So a couple of things I've created are,there's a poster over herethat you can play drums on.I'll just describe how this works.(Drums)And it has really good response time.Okay. Thanks.(Applause)And there's a couple of other things.So this one is like a sound board,(Sirens, explosions, breaking glass)Okay, and this is a D.J. turntable.So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad,Oh, yes. I just love doing that.(Scratching)So I've made some new technology,and I love things being creative,and I love working with creative people.So my 15-year-old niece, she's amazing,and she's called Charlotte,and I asked her to record something,and I worked with a friend called Elliotto put some beats together.So this is my niece, Charlotte.(Music)Yay!(Applause)So that's pretty much what I do.I just love bringing technology together,having a lot of fun, being creative.But it's not about the technology.So thank you very much.(Applause)

Everything is interconnected.As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.We are a small fishing tribesituated on the southeastern tip of Long Islandnear the town of Southampton in New York.When I was a little girl,my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.There were no clouds in the sky.And after a while I began to perspire.And he pointed up to the sky, and he said,"Look, do you see that?That's part of you up there.That's your water that helps to make the cloudthat becomes the rain that feeds the plantsthat feeds the animals."In my continued exploration of subjects in naturethat have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life,I started storm chasing in 2008after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that."And so three days later, driving very fast,I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell,capable of producing grapefruit-size hailand spectacular tornadoes,although only two percent actually do.These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wideand reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.They can grow so big, blocking all daylight,making it very dark and ominous standing under them.Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your backand the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.And then there are the colors in the cloudsof hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues.I've learned to respect the lightning.My hair used to be straight.(Laughter)I'm just kidding.(Laughter)What really excites me about these stormsis their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate,with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.They become lovely monsters.When I'm photographing them,I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.As I stand under them,I see not just a cloud,but understand that what I have the privilege to witnessis the same forces, the same process in a small-scale versionthat helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sunand even this very planet.All my relations. Thank you.(Applause)



daniel_suarez_the_kill_decision_shouldn_t_belong_to_a_robot

I write fiction sci-fi thrillers,so if I say "killer robots,"you'd probably think something like this.But I'm actually not here to talk about fiction.I'm here to talk about very real killer robots,autonomous combat drones.Now, I'm not referring to Predator and Reaper drones,which have a human making targeting decisions.I'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weaponsthat make lethal decisions about human beingsall on their own.There's actually a technical term for this: lethal autonomy.Now, lethally autonomous killer robotswould take many forms -- flying, driving,or just lying in wait.And actually, they're very quickly becoming a reality.These are two automatic sniper stationscurrently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea.Both of these machines are capable of automaticallyidentifying a human target and firing on it,the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer.Now, in both cases, there's still a human in the loopto make that lethal firing decision,but it's not a technological requirement. It's a choice.And it's that choice that I want to focus on,because as we migrate lethal decision-makingfrom humans to software,we risk not only taking the humanity out of war,but also changing our social landscape entirely,far from the battlefield.That's because the way humans resolve conflictshapes our social landscape.And this has always been the case, throughout history.For example, these were state-of-the-art weapons systemsin 1400 A.D.Now they were both very expensive to build and maintain,but with these you could dominate the populace,and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that.Power was focused at the very top.And what changed? Technological innovation.Gunpowder, cannon.And pretty soon, armor and castles were obsolete,and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefieldversus how many people you brought to the battlefield.And as armies grew in size, the nation-state aroseas a political and logistical requirement of defense.And as leaders had to rely on more of their populace,they began to share power.Representative government began to form.So again, the tools we use to resolve conflictshape our social landscape.Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool,except that, by requiring very few people to go to war,they risk re-centralizing power into very few hands,possibly reversing a five-century trend toward democracy.Now, I think, knowing this,we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions,to do what humans do best, which is adapt.But time is a factor.Seventy nations are developing remotely-pilotedcombat drones of their own,and as you'll see, remotely-piloted combat dronesare the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons.That's because once you've deployed remotely-piloted drones,there are three powerful factors pushing decision-makingaway from humans and on to the weapon platform itself.The first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce.For example, in 2004, the U.S. drone fleet produceda grand total of 71 hours of video surveillance for analysis.By 2011, this had gone up to 300,000 hours,outstripping human ability to review it all,but even that number is about to go up drastically.The Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programswill put up to 65 independently operated camera eyeson each drone platform,and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it.And that means visual intelligence software will needto scan it for items of interest.And that means very soondrones will tell humans what to look at,not the other way around.But there's a second powerful incentive pushingdecision-making away from humans and onto machines,and that's electromagnetic jamming,severing the connection between the droneand its operator.Now we saw an example of this in 2011when an American RQ-170 Sentinel dronegot a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack,but any remotely-piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack,and that means droneswill have to shoulder more decision-making.They'll know their mission objective,and they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance.They'll ignore external radio signalsand send very few of their own.Which brings us to, really, the thirdand most powerful incentive pushing decision-makingaway from humans and onto weapons:plausible deniability.Now we live in a global economy.High-tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents.Cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designsto parts unknown,and in that environment, it is very likelythat a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories,proliferate in the gray market.And in that situation, sifting through the wreckageof a suicide drone attack, it will be very difficult to saywho sent that weapon.This raises the very real possibilityof anonymous war.This could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head,make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepoweragainst an attacker, and that could shift the balancein the 21st century away from defense and toward offense.It could make military action a viable optionnot just for small nations,but criminal organizations, private enterprise,even powerful individuals.It could create a landscape of rival warlordsundermining rule of law and civil society.Now if responsibility and transparencyare two of the cornerstones of representative government,autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both.Now you might be thinking thatcitizens of high-tech nationswould have the advantage in any robotic war,that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable,particularly against developing nations.But I think the truth is the exact opposite.I think citizens of high-tech societiesare more vulnerable to robotic weapons,and the reason can be summed up in one word: data.Data powers high-tech societies.Cell phone geolocation, telecom metadata,social media, email, text, financial transaction data,transportation data, it's a wealth of real-time dataon the movements and social interactions of people.In short, we are more visible to machinesthan any people in history,and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons.What you're looking at hereis a link analysis map of a social group.Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals.And these types of maps can be automatically generatedbased on the data trail modern people leave behind.Now it's typically used to market goods and servicesto targeted demographics, but it's a dual-use technology,because targeting is used in another context.Notice that certain individuals are highlighted.These are the hubs of social networks.These are organizers, opinion-makers, leaders,and these people also can be automatically identifiedfrom their communication patterns.Now, if you're a marketer, you might then target themwith product samples, try to spread your brandthrough their social group.But if you're a repressive governmentsearching for political enemies, you might instead remove them,eliminate them, disrupt their social group,and those who remain behind lose social cohesionand organization.Now in a world of cheap, proliferating robotic weapons,borders would offer very little protectionto critics of distant governmentsor trans-national criminal organizations.Popular movements agitating for changecould be detected early and their leaders eliminatedbefore their ideas achieve critical mass.And ideas achieving critical massis what political activism in popular government is all about.Anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal actionan easy choice for all sorts of competing interests.And this would put a chill on free speechand popular political action, the very heart of democracy.And this is why we need an international treatyon robotic weapons, and in particular a global banon the development and deployment of killer robots.Now we already have international treatieson nuclear and biological weapons, and, while imperfect,these have largely worked.But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous,because they will almost certainly be used,and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions.Now in November 2012 the U.S. Department of Defenseissued a directive requiringa human being be present in all lethal decisions.This temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military,but that directive needs to be made permanent.And it could set the stage for global action.Because we need an international legal frameworkfor robotic weapons.And we need it now, before there's a devastating attackor a terrorist incident that causes nations of the worldto rush to adopt these weaponsbefore thinking through the consequences.Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much powerin too few hands, and they would imperil democracy itself.Now, don't get me wrong, I think there are tonsof great uses for unarmed civilian drones:environmental monitoring, search and rescue, logistics.If we have an international treaty on robotic weapons,how do we gain the benefits of autonomous dronesand vehicles while still protecting ourselvesagainst illegal robotic weapons?I think the secret will be transparency.No robot should have an expectation of privacyin a public place.(Applause)Each robot and drone should havea cryptographically signed I.D. burned in at the factorythat can be used to track its movement through public spaces.We have license plates on cars, tail numbers on aircraft.This is no different.And every citizen should be able to download an appthat shows the population of drones and autonomous vehiclesmoving through public spaces around them,both right now and historically.And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic dronesto detect rogue drones,and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down,they should notify humans to their presence.And in certain very high-security areas,perhaps civic drones would snare themand drag them off to a bomb disposal facility.But notice, this is more an immune systemthan a weapons system.It would allow us to avail ourselves of the useof autonomous vehicles and droneswhile still preserving our open, civil society.We must ban the deployment and developmentof killer robots.Let's not succumb to the temptation to automate war.Autocratic governments and criminal organizationsundoubtedly will, but let's not join them.Autonomous robotic weaponswould concentrate too much powerin too few unseen hands,and that would be corrosive to representative government.Let's make sure, for democracies at least,killer robots remain fiction.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. (Applause)



martin_villeneuve_how_i_made_an_impossible_film
932300

I made a film that was impossible to make,but I didn't know it was impossible,and that's how I was able to do it."Mars et Avril" is a science fiction film.It's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future.No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec beforebecause it's expensive, it's set in the future,and it's got tons of visual effects,and it's shot on green screen.Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to makeever since I was a kid, really,back when I was reading some comic booksand dreaming about what the future might be.When American producers see my film,they think that I had a big budget to do it,like 23 million.But in fact I had 10 percent of that budget.I did "Mars et Avril" for only 2.3 million.So you might wonder, what's the deal here?How did I do this?Well, it's two things. First, it's time.When you don't have money, you must take time,and it took me seven years to do "Mars et Avril."The second aspect is love.I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved.And it seems like every department had nothing,so they had to rely on our creativityand turn every problem into an opportunity.And that brings me to the point of my talk, actually,how constraints, big creative constraints, can boost creativity.But let me go back in time a bit.In my early 20s, I did some graphic novels,but they weren't your usual graphic novels.They were books telling a science fiction storythrough images and text,and most of the actors who are now starringin the movie adaptation, they were already involvedin these books portraying charactersinto a sort of experimental, theatrical, simplistic way.And one of these actors is the great stage directorand actor Robert Lepage.And I just love this guy.I've been in love with this guy since I was a kid.His career I admire a lot.And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project,and he was kind enough to lend his imageto the character of Eugène Spaak,who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relationin between time, space, love, music and women.And he was a perfect fit for the part,and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance.He was the one who believed in meand encouraged me to do an adaptation of my booksinto a film, and to write, direct,and produce the film myself.And Robert is actually the very first exampleof how constraints can boost creativity.Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet.I mean, his agenda is booked until 2042,and he's really hard to get,and I wanted him to be in the movie,to reprise his role in the movie.But the thing is, had I waitedfor him until 2042, my film wouldn't bea futuristic film anymore, so I just couldn't do that. Right?But that's kind of a big problem.How do you get somebody who is too busyto star in a movie?Well, I said as a joke in a production meeting --and this is a true story, by the way —I said, "Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram?Because, you know, he is everywhereand nowhere on the planet at the same time,and he's an illuminated being in my mind,and he's in between reality and virtual reality,so it would make perfect senseto turn this guy into a hologram."Everybody around the table laughed,but the joke was kind of a good solution,so that's what we ended up doing.Here's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras.He was dressed in green and he was likein a green aquarium.Each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head,so that in post-production we could usepretty much any angle we needed,and we shot only his head.Six months later there was a guy on set,a mime portraying the body,the vehicle for the head.And he was wearing a green hoodso that we could erase the green hood in postproductionand replace it with Robert Lepage's head.So he became like a renaissance man,and here's what it looks like in the movie.(Music)(Video) Robert Lepage: [As usual, Arthur's drawingdidn't account for the technical challenges.I welded the breech, but the valve is still gaping.I tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box,but I might have hit a heartstring.It still sounds too low.]Jacques Languirand: [That's normal.The instrument always ends up resembling its model.](Music)Martin Villeneuve: Now these musical instrumentsthat you see in this excerpt,they're my second example of howconstraints can boost creativity,because I desperately needed these objects in my movie.They are objects of desire.They are imaginary musical instruments.And they carry a nice story with them.Actually, I knew what these things would look likein my mind for many, many years.But my problem was, I didn't have the moneyto pay for them. I couldn't afford them.So that's kind of a big problem too.How do you get something that you can't afford?And, you know, I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea.I said, "What if I have somebody else pay for them?"(Laughter)But who on Earth would be interestedby seven not-yet-built musical instrumentsinspired by women's bodies?And I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal,because who better to understand the kind ofcrazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen?So I found my way to Guy Laliberté, Cirque du Soleil's CEO,and I presented my crazy idea to himwith sketches like this and visual references,and something pretty amazing happened.Guy was interested by this ideanot because I was asking for his money,but because I came to him with a good ideain which everybody was happy.It was kind of a perfect trianglein which the art buyer was happybecause he got the instruments at a cheaper price,because they weren't even made.He took a leap of faith.And the artist, Dominique Engel, brilliant guy,he was happy too because he had a dream projectto work on for a year.And obviously I was happy because I got the instrumentsin my film for free, which was kind of what I tried to do.So here they are.And my last example of how constraintscan boost creativitycomes from the green,because this is a weird color, a crazy color,and you need to replace the green screens eventuallyand you must figure that out sooner rather than later.And I had, again, pretty much, ideas in my mindas to what the world would be,but then again I turned to my childhood imaginationand went to the work of Belgian comic book masterFrançois Schuiten in Belgium.And this guy is another guy I admire a lot,and I wanted him to be involved in the movieas a production designer.But people told me, you know, Martin, it's impossible,the guy is too busy and he will say no.Well, I said, you know what, instead of mimicking his style,I might as well call the real guy and ask him,and I sent him my books,and he answered that he was interestedin working on the film with mebecause he could be a big fish in a small aquarium.In other words, there was space for him to dream with me.So here I was with one of my childhood heroes,drawing every single frame that's in the filmto turn that into Montreal in the future.And it was an amazing collaborationto work with this great artist whom I admire.But then, you know, eventually you have to turnall these drawings into reality.So, again, my solution was to aimfor the best possible artist that I could think of.And there's this guy in Montreal, another Quebecoiscalled Carlos Monzon, and he's a very good VFX artist.This guy had been lead compositor on such filmsas "Avatar" and "Star Trek" and "Transformers,"and other unknown projects like this,and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job,and I had to convince him,and, instead of working on the next Spielberg movie,he accepted to work on mine.Why? Because I offered him a space to dream.So if you don't have money to offer to people,you must strike their imagination with somethingas nice as you can think of.So this is what happened on this movie,and that's how it got made,and we went to this very nice postproduction companyin Montreal called Vision Globale,and they lent their 60 artists to work full timefor six months to do this crazy film.So I want to tell you that, if you have some crazy ideasin your mind, and that people tell youthat it's impossible to make,well, that's an even better reason to want to do it,because people have a tendencyto see the problems rather than the final result,whereas if you start to deal with problemsas being your allies rather than your opponents,life will start to dance with youin the most amazing way.I have experienced it.And you might end up doing some crazy projects,and who knows, you might even end upgoing to Mars.Thank you.(Applause)



lisa_bu_how_books_can_open_your_mind

So I was trained to become a gymnastfor two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.When I was in the first grade, the governmentwanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,all expenses paid.But my tiger mother said, "No."My parents wanted me to becomean engineer like them.After surviving the Cultural Revolution,they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:a safe and well-paid job.It is not important if I like the job or not.But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.That is me playing my imaginary piano.An opera singer must start training youngto learn acrobatics,so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.I even wrote to the school principaland the host of a radio show.But no adults liked the idea.No adults believed I was serious.Only my friends supported me, but they were kids,just as powerless as I was.So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.My dream would never come true.I was afraid that for the rest of my lifesome second-class happinesswould be the best I could hope for.But that's so unfair.So I was determined to find another calling.Nobody around to teach me? Fine.I turned to books.I satisfied my hunger for parental advicefrom this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"]I found my role model of an independent womanwhen Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"]And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"]And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin]I came to the U.S. in 1995,so which books did I read here first?Books banned in China, of course."The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.The Bible is interesting, but strange.(Laughter)That's a topic for a different day.But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany:"You shall honor your father and mother.""Honor," I said. "That's so different,and better, than obey."So it becomes my tool to climb outof this Confucian guilt trapand to restart my relationship with my parents.Encountering a new culture also started my habitof comparative reading.It offers many insights.For example, I found this map out of place at firstbecause this is what Chinese students grew up with.It had never occurred to me,China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.A map actually carries somebody's view.Comparative reading actually is nothing new.It's a standard practice in the academic world.There are even research fieldssuch as comparative religion and comparative literature.Compare and contrast gives scholarsa more complete understanding of a topic.So I thought, well, if comparative readingworks for research, why not do it in daily life too?So I started reading books in pairs.So they can be about people --["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] --who are involved in the same event,or friends with shared experiences.["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder]I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter)[Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] --or similar stories from different cultures,as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell]For example, both the Christ and the Buddhawent through three temptations.For the Christ, the temptationsare economic, political and spiritual.For the Buddha, they are all psychological:lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.So if you know a foreign language, it's also funto read your favorite books in two languages.["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts]Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.For example, it's through translation that I realized"happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh!"Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.(Laughter)Books have given me a magic portal to connect with peopleof the past and the present.I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.Having a dream shattered really is nothingcompared to what many others have suffered.I have come to believe that coming trueis not the only purpose of a dream.Its most important purpose is to get us in touchwith where dreams come from,where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.Even a shattered dream can do that for you.So because of books, I'm here today,happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,most of the time.So may books be always with you.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. (Applause)Thank you. (Applause)

(Music)(Applause)Thank you.Hi, everybody.Ban-gap-seum-ni-da.I'd like to share with you a little bit of meplaying my life.I might look successful and happybeing in front of you today,but I once suffered from severe depressionand was in total despair.The violin, which meant everything to me,became a grave burden on me.Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me,their words sounded like meaningless noise.When I was just about to give everything upafter years of suffering,I started to rediscover the true power of music.(Music)In the midst of hardship,it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul.The comfort the music gave mewas just indescribable,and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too,and it totally changed my perspective on lifeand set me free from the pressureof becoming a successful violinist.Do you feel like you are all alone?I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart,as it did for me.(Music)(Applause)Thank you.Now, I use my music to reach people's heartsand have found there are no boundaries.My audience is anyone who is here to listen,even those who are not familiar with classical music.I not only play at the prestigious classical concert hallslike Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center,but also hospitals, churches, prisons,and restricted facilities for leprosy patients,just to mention a few.Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show youthat classical music can be so much fun, exciting,and that it can rock you.Let me introduce you to my brand new project,"Baroque in Rock,"which became a golden disc most recently.It's such an honor for me.I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician,I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined.But it's now your turn.Changing your perspectiveswill not only transform you but also the whole world.Just play your life with all you have,and share it with the world.I really look forward to witnessinga transforming world by you, TEDsters.Play your life, and stay tuned.(Music)(Applause)

When I was 14 years old,I had low self-esteem.I felt I was not talented at anything.One day, I bought a yo-yo.When I tried my first trick, it looked like this.I couldn't even do the simplest trick,but it was very natural for me,because I was not dextrous, and hated all sports.But after one week of practicing,my throws became more like this.A bit better.I thought, the yo-yo is something for me to be good at,for the first time in my life.I found my passion.I was spending all my time practicing.It took me hours and hours a dayto build my skills up to the next level.And then, four years later, when I was 18 years old,I was standing onstage at the World Yo-Yo Contest.And I won.I was so excited. "Yes, I did it! I became a hero.I may get many sponsors, a lot of money,tons of interviews, and be on TV!" I thought. (Laughter)But after coming back to Japan,totally nothing changed in my life.I realized society didn't value my passion.So I went back to my collegeand became a typical Japanese workeras a systems engineer.I felt my passion, heart and soul, had left my body.I felt I was not alive anymore.So I started to consider what I should do,and I thought, I wanted to make my performance better,and to show onstage how spectacular the yo-yo could beto change the public's image of the yo-yo.So I quit my companyand started a career as a professional performer.I started to learn classic ballet, jazz dance,acrobatics and other thingsto make my performance better.As a result of these efforts, and the help of many others,it happened.I won the World Yo-Yo Contest againin the artistic performance division.I passed an audition for Cirque du Soleil.Today, I am standing on the TED stagewith the yo-yo in front of you.(Applause)What I learned from the yo-yo is,if I make enough effort with huge passion,there is no impossible.Could you let me share my passion with youthrough my performance?(Applause)(Water Sounds)(Music)(Applause)(Music)(Music) (Applause)(Applause)(Music) (Applause)(Applause)(Music)(Applause)

In two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversaryof the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed "Jeopardy" set.I mean, nine years is a long time.And given "Jeopardy's" average demographics,I think what that meansis most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead.(Laughter)But not all, a few are still alive.Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.And when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all.I think that ship has sailed, it's too late for me.For better or for worse, that's what I'm going to be known as,as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff.And I can't complain about this.I feel like that was always sort of my destiny,although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet.If nothing else, you realize very quickly as a teenager,it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name.(Laughter)And as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years.But if you go further back, if you look at it, it's all there.I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dadwith whatever great fact I had just read about --Haley's comet or giant squidsor the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was.I now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same.And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work.(Laughter)And I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows.I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school,that I was also going to miss "Hollywood Squares" and "Family Feud."I was going to miss my game shows.And later, in the mid-'80s,when "Jeopardy" came back on the air,I remember running home from school every day to watch the show.It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.And we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working,where there was only one English language TV channel.There was Armed Forces TV,and if you didn't speak Korean, that's what you were watching.So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch "Jeopardy."I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid.I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80sand holding my own, back when that was a fad.There's a weird sense of mastery you getwhen you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know.You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know.And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power --the right fact deployed at exactly the right place.I never had a guidance counselorwho thought this was a legitimate career path,that thought you could major in triviaor be a professional ex-game show contestant.And so I sold out way too young.I didn't try to figure out what one does with that.I studied computers because I heard that was the thing,and I became a computer programmer --not an especially good one,not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on "Jeopardy" in 2004.But that's what I was doing.And it made it doubly ironic -- my computer background --a few years later, I think 2009 or so,when I got another phone call from "Jeopardy" saying,"It's early days yet, but IBM tells usthey want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.'Are you up for this?"This was the first I'd heard of it.And of course I said yes, for several reasons.One, because playing "Jeopardy" is a great time.It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on.(Laughter)And I would do it for nothing.I don't think they know that, luckily,but I would go back and play for Arby's coupons.I just love "Jeopardy," and I always have.And second of all, because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future.People playing computers on game showswas the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future,and now I could be on the stage with it.I was not going to say no.The third reason I said yesis because I was pretty confident that I was going to win.I had taken some artificial intelligence classes.I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on "Jeopardy."People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of programthat can read a "Jeopardy" clue in a natural language like Englishand understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings,unpack the meaning of the clue.The kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human, little kid could do,very hard for a computer.And I thought, well this is going to be child's play.Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species.(Laughter)But as the years went on,as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this,I started to get occasional updates from them,and I started to get a little more worried.I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph.It was a scatter chart showing performance on "Jeopardy,"tens of thousands of dots representing "Jeopardy" champions up at the topwith their performance plotted on number of --I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess,clues responded to --versus the accuracy of those answers.So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to.And at first, it was very low.There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.But then you see the line start to go up.And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chartsome darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color.And thought, what are these?"The black dots in the upper right represent 74-time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings."And I saw this line coming for me.And I realized, this is it.This is what it looks like when the future comes for you.(Laughter)It's not the Terminator's gun sight;it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do,the only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at.And when the game eventually happened about a year later,it was very different than the "Jeopardy" games I'd been used to.We were not playing in L.A. on the regular "Jeopardy" set.Watson does not travel.Watson's actually huge.It's thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory,trillions of bytes of memory.We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room.The only other "Jeopardy" contestant to this day I've ever been inside.And so Watson does not travel.You must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage.So me and the other human playerwound up at this secret IBM research labin the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester Countyto play the computer.And we realized right awaythat the computer had a big home court advantage.There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage.Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls,and there's the thing in the middle of their court.And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmerscheering on their little darling,having poured millions of dollars into thishoping against hope that the humans screw up,and holding up "Go Watson" signsand just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right.I think guys had "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their bellies in grease paint.If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their gut,it's an unpleasant sight.But they were right. They were exactly right.I don't want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR,but Watson won handily.And I remember standing there behind the podiumas I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking.It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer.And you could hear that little tick, tick, tick, tick.And I remember thinking, this is it.I felt obsolete.I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80sseeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line.I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsoleteunder this new regime of thinking computers.And it hasn't been the last.If you watch the news, you'll see occasionally --and I see this all the time --that pharmacists now, there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automaticallywithout actually needing a human pharmacist.And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegalsbecause there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions.You don't need human assistants for that anymore.I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box scorefrom a baseball or football gameand it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the gameand was commenting on it.And obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a jobas the humans they're replacing,but they're faster, and crucially, they're much, much cheaper.So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.I've read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies,we'll enter a new golden age of leisurewhen we'll all have time for the things we really lovebecause all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren.I've heard other people say quite the opposite,that this is yet another tier of the middle classthat's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technologyand that this is actually something ominous,something that we should worry about.I'm not an economist myself.All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible.Here's the one thing that I was ever good at,and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest peopleand thousands of processors working in paralleland they could do the same thing.They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV,and "I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore."And it made me think, what does this mean,if we're going to be able to start outsourcing,not just lower unimportant brain functions.I'm sure many of you remember a distant timewhen we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers.And suddenly there was a machine that did that,and now we don't need to remember that anymore.I have read that there's now actually evidencethat the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships,physically shrinks and atrophiesin people who use tools like GPS,because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore.We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard.And as a result, a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuffgets smaller and dumber.And it made me think, what happens when computers are now betterat knowing and remembering stuff than we are?Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know,this was a terrifying idea to me.The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important.The things we know are still important.I came to believe there were two advantagesthat those of us who have these things in our head haveover somebody who says, "Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second."There's an advantage of volume, and there's an advantage of time.The advantage of volume, first,just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays.There's so much information out there.Being a Renaissance man or woman,that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance.Now it's really not possibleto be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.There's just too much.They say that the scope of human informationis now doubling every 18 months or so,the sum total of human information.That means between now and late 2014,we will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes,as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together.It's doubling every 18 months now.This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we makerequire the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts.A decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in?Who do I vote for?Do I take this job or that one?These are the decisions that require correct judgmentsabout many different kinds of facts.If we have those facts at our mental fingertips,we're going to be able to make informed decisions.If, on the other hand, we need to look them all up,we may be in trouble.According to a National Geographic survey I just saw,somewhere along the lines of 80 percentof the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policycannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map.If you can't do that first step,are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to knowto master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy?Quite probably not.At some point you're just going to be like,"You know what? There's too much to know. Screw it."And you'll make a less informed decision.The other issue is the advantage of time that you haveif you have all these things at your fingertips.I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith.She was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, Englandon vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand.She runs up to them on the beach one morningand says, "Mom, Dad, we've got to get off the beach."And they say, "What do you mean? We just got here."And she said, "In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month,he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to seaand you see the waves churning way out there,that's the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach."What would you do if your 10-year-old daughter came up to you with this?Her parents thought about it,and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her.They told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel,and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily,because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami,the day after Christmas, 2004,that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean.But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach,because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before.Now when facts come in handy like that --I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact,one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time --normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.But in this case it happened in real life.And it happens in real life all the time.It's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation.It's a meeting or job interview or first dateor some relationship that gets lubricatedbecause two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge.You say where you're from, and I say, "Oh, yeah."Or your alma mater or your job,and I know just a little something about it,enough to get the ball rolling.People love that shared connection that gets createdwhen somebody knows something about you.It's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met.That's often the advantage of time.And it's not effective if you say, "Well, hold on.You're from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up.Oh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo."That doesn't work. That's just annoying.(Laughter)The great 18th-century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson,Samuel Parr once said, "It's always better to know a thing than not to know it."And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, it's probably that.I have always believed that the things we know -- that knowledge is an absolute good,that the things we have learned and carry with us in our headsare what make us who we are,as individuals and as a species.I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete.I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replacedby these little bubbles of specialty,so that none of us know about the common associationsthat used to bind our civilization together.I don't want to be the last trivia know-it-allsitting on a mountain somewhere,reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of "Simpsons" episodesand the lyrics of Abba songs.I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all shareand that we know without having to outsource it to our devices,to our search engines and our smartphones.In the movies, when computers like Watson start to think,things don't always end well.Those movies are never about beautiful utopias.It's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in "2001."Things always go terribly wrong.And I feel like we're sort of at the point nowwhere we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in.This is a question of leadership,because it becomes a question of who leads the future.On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden agewhere information is more universally availablethan it's ever been in human history,where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.And on the other hand,we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopiawhere the machines have taken overand we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore,that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud,and why would we ever bother learning anything new.Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in.And we can all make that choice.We make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn,who don't just say, "Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over,I don't have to learn anymore,"or "Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime.I don't have to learn new things anymore."No, every day we should be striving to learn something new.We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us.That's where the people you see on "Jeopardy" come from.These know-it-alls, they're not Rainman-style savantssitting at home memorizing the phone book.I've met a lot of them.For the most part, they are just normal folkswho are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything,thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject.We can live in one of these two worlds.We can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know,continue to be the thing that makes us special,or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson.Ladies and gentlemen, the choice is yours.Thank you very much.

In 1991 I hadmaybe the most profound and transformativeexperience of my life.I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.I took a couple victory laps in there.And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California,and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus,and we were relaxing next to this beautifulidyllic lake in the mountains.And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise,and as we sat there, over the mountains coming infrom the north were these Steven Spielbergian cloudsrolling toward us,and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley,so help me God, every single animal in that placestopped making noise at the same time.(Whoosh) This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.And then the clouds came over us, and then,boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.It was just extraordinary, and when I came back homeI found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz,and decided to set it to music,a piece for choir called "Cloudburst,"which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.Now fast forward to just three years ago.(Music) And we released to YouTube this,the Virtual Choir Project,185 singers from 12 different countries.You can see my little video there conducting these people,alone in their dorm roomsor in their living rooms at home.Two years ago, on this very stage, we premieredVirtual Choir 2,2,052 singers from 58 different countries,this time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep."And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3,"Water Night," another piece that I had written,this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.(Music)And when I was speaking to Chris about the futureof Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this,he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.Could we do this all in real time?Could we have people singing together in real time?And with the help of Skype,that is what we are going to attempt today.Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach,Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College,some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and —(Applause) --and in the second half of the piece,the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singersfrom 30 different countries.Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go,but there's still less than a second of latency,but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.We deal in milliseconds.So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst"so that it embraces the latencyand the performers sing into the latencyinstead of trying to be exactly together.So with deep humility, and for your approval,we present "Cloudburst."(Applause)(Piano)[The rain ...][Eyes of shadow-water][eyes of well-water][eyes of dream-water.][Blue suns, green whirlwinds,][birdbeaks of light pecking open][pomegranate stars.][But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?][Only blood, only dust,][only naked footsteps on the thorns?][The rain awakens...][We must sleep with open eyes,][we must dream with our hands,][we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,][of the sun dreaming its worlds.][We must dream aloud,][we must sing till the song puts forth roots,][trunk, branches, birds, stars.][We must find the lost word,][and remember what the blood,][the tides, the earth, and the body say,][and return to the point of departure...](Music)(Applause)["Cloudburst" Octavio Paz][translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre]Eric Whitacre: Beth.

(Breathes in)(Breathes out)For about the five years after graduatingthis was my day job.(Laughter)because everybody always wants to know,who are these freaks in real life.(Laughter)Hello.put a hat or a can at my feet,I handed them a flower --and some intense eye contact.And if they didn't take the flower,as they walked away.(Laughter)especially lonely peoplebeing allowed in a city street,And my eyes would say --"Thank you.I see you."And their eyes would say --"Nobody ever sees me.Thank you."I would get harassed sometimes.People would yell at me from their cars."Get a job!"(Laughing) And I'd be, like,"This is my job."But it hurt, because it made me fearand unfair, shameful.for the music business on this box.And for the economists out there,It was consistent.with my band, the Dresden Dolls.This was me on piano, a genius drummer.I wrote the songs, and eventuallyand as we started touring,I really didn't want to lose this senseand they would pass the hat,And then Twitter came along,and made things even more magic,So I would need a piano to practice on,This is in London.People would bring home-cooked food to usThis is in Seattle.Fans who worked in museums and storesThis is a library in Auckland.who says hello.And a nurse from a hospital drove oneright at that moment to the cafe I was in,and I bought her a smoothieAnd I love this kind of random closeness,but there's no wireless,and in punk squats,(Laughter)And that night, her whole familyso that we could take their beds.And I lay there thinking,these people have so little.Is this fair?And in the morning,and wanted to give me a Bible,And I thought, this is fair.This is this.I'm on the Lower East Side,I've always been with my band or my crew.Is this what stupid people do?(Laughter)Is this how stupid people die?She's an artist.He's a financial blogger for Reuters,and they're pouring me a glass of red wineand offering me a bath,I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfingare basically the same thing.You're falling into the audienceand you're trusting each other.I once asked an opening band of mineAnd as usual, the band was psyched,but there was this one guy in the bandAnd I recognized his fearof "Is this fair?"and "Get a job."We sign with a major label.It's not for everybody.Well, maybe it's for you.(Laughter)in the first few weeks,and the label considers this a failure.I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"They said, "No, the sales are going down.It's a failure."And they walk off.and a guy comes up to meand hands me a $10 bill,and he says,(Laughter)I just want you to have this money."And this starts happening all the time.I become the hat after my own gigs,and unlike the guy in the opening band,Thank you.And this is the moment I decideonline whenever possible,Amanda Palmer over here,but I'm going to ask for help,because I saw it work on the street.I turned to crowdfunding.and I asked my crowd to catch me.And the goal was 100,000 dollars.My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,(Applause)And you can see how many people it is.It's about 25,000 people.And the media asked,I asked them.And through the very act of asking people,I'd connected with them,They don't want to ask for things.But it's not easy.It's not easy to ask.Asking makes you vulnerable.And I got a lot of criticism online,after my Kickstarter went big,specifically for asking musiciansAnd this hurt in a really familiar way.And people saying,and they couldn't see the exchangeSo this is slightly not safe for work.(Laughter)I recommend this,(Laughter)because what I was really saying here was,I trust you this much.Should I?Show me.For most of human history,but the Internetare taking us back.and about those people being enough.of no hard sticker price.the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell,I don't see these things as risk.I see them as trust.Now, the online toolsthey're getting there.if we can't face each otherand give and receive fearlessly,but, more important --to ask without shame.My music career has been spentand our fears and our hangovers,our mistakes,and we see each other.And I think when we really see each other,we want to help each other.What if we started asking,"How do we let people pay for music?"Thank you.(Applause)

One day in 1819,3,000 miles off the coast of Chile,in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean,20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater.They'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had rippeda catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.As their ship began to sink beneath the swells,the men huddled together in three small whaleboats.These men were 10,000 miles from home,more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.In their small boats, they carried onlyrudimentary navigational equipmentand limited supplies of food and water.These were the men of the whaleship Essex,whose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick."Even in today's world, their situation would be really dire,but think about how much worse it would have been then.No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.No search party was coming to look for these men.So most of us have never experienced a situationas frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves,but we all know what it's like to be afraid.We know how fear feels,but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking aboutwhat our fears mean.As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fearas a weakness, just another childish thing to discardlike baby teeth or roller skates.And I think it's no accident that we think this way.Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beingsare hard-wired to be optimists.So maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,as a danger in and of itself."Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."In English, fear is something we conquer.It's something we fight. It's something we overcome.But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination,something that can be as profound and insightfulas storytelling itself?It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imaginationin young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.When I was a child, I lived in California,which is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live,but for me as a child, California could also be a little scary.I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelierthat hung above our dining table swing back and forthduring every minor earthquake,and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrifiedthat the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.And what we say about kids who have fears like thatis that they have a vivid imagination.But at a certain point, most of us learnto leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed,and not every earthquake brings buildings down.But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative mindsfail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.The same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species,""Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past,"also generated intense worries that haunted the adult livesof Charles Darwin, Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust.So the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fearfrom visionaries and young children?Well let's return to the year 1819 for a moment,to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginationswere generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.The time had come for the men to make a plan,but they had very few options.In his fascinating account of the disaster,Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just aboutas far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.The men knew that the nearest islands they could reachwere the Marquesas Islands, 1,200 miles away.But they'd heard some frightening rumors.They'd been told that these islands,and several others nearby, were populated by cannibals.So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murderedand eaten for dinner.Another possible destination was Hawaii,but given the season, the captain was afraidthey'd be struck by severe storms.Now the last option was the longest, and the most difficult:to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reachinga certain band of winds that could eventuallypush them toward the coast of South America.But they knew that the sheer length of this journeywould stretch their supplies of food and water.To be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms,to starve to death before reaching land.These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men,and as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen towould govern whether they lived or died.Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.What if instead of calling them fears,we called them stories?Because that's really what fear is, if you think about it.It's a kind of unintentional storytellingthat we are all born knowing how to do.And fears and storytelling have the same components.They have the same architecture.Like all stories, fears have characters.In our fears, the characters are us.Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails.Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can beevery bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.Picture a cannibal, human teethsinking into human skin,human flesh roasting over a fire.Fears also have suspense.If I've done my job as a storyteller today,you should be wondering what happenedto the men of the whaleship Essex.Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attentionon a question that is as important in life as it is in literature:What will happen next?In other words, our fears make us think about the future.And humans, by the way, are the only creatures capableof thinking about the future in this way,of projecting ourselves forward in time,and this mental time travel is just one more thingthat fears have in common with storytelling.As a writer, I can tell you that a big part of writing fictionis learning to predict how one event in a storywill affect all the other events,and fear works in that same way.In fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another.When I was writing my first novel, "The Age Of Miracles,"I spent months trying to figure out what would happenif the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.What would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?What would happen to our minds?And then it was only later that I realized how very similarthese questions were to the ones I used to ask myselfas a child frightened in the night.If an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry,what will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.So if we think of our fears as more than just fearsbut as stories, we should think of ourselvesas the authors of those stories.But just as importantly, we need to think of ourselvesas the readers of our fears, and how we chooseto read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.Now, some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs,and the author found that these people shared a habitthat he called "productive paranoia," which meant thatthese people, instead of dismissing their fears,these people read them closely, they studied them,and then they translated that fear into preparation and action.So that way, if their worst fears came true,their businesses were ready.And sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear.Once in a while, our fears can predict the future.But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fearsthat our imaginations concoct.So how can we tell the difference betweenthe fears worth listening to and all the others?I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essexoffers an illuminating, if tragic, example.After much deliberation, the men finally made a decision.Terrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islandsand instead embarked on the longerand much more difficult route to South America.After more than two months at sea, the men ran out of foodas they knew they might,and they were still quite far from land.When the last of the survivors were finally picked upby two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive,and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.Herman Melville, who used this story as research for "Moby Dick,"wrote years later, and from dry land, quote,"All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essexmight in all human probability have been avoidedhad they, immediately after leaving the wreck,steered straight for Tahiti.But," as Melville put it, "they dreaded cannibals."So the question is, why did these men dread cannibalsso much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation?Why were they swayed by one storyso much more than the other?Looked at from this angle,theirs becomes a story about reading.The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best readerhas a combination of two very different temperaments,the artistic and the scientific.A good reader has an artist's passion,a willingness to get caught up in the story,but just as importantly, the readers also needsthe coolness of judgment of a scientist,which acts to temper and complicatethe reader's intuitive reactions to the story.As we've seen, the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios.The problem was that they listened to the wrong story.Of all the narratives their fears wrote,they responded only to the most lurid, the most vivid,the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture:cannibals.But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fearsmore like a scientist, with more coolness of judgment,they would have listened instead to the less violentbut the more likely tale, the story of starvation,and headed for Tahiti, just as Melville's sad commentary suggests.And maybe if we all tried to read our fears,we too would be less often swayedby the most salacious among them.Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying aboutserial killers and plane crashes,and more time concerned with the subtlerand slower disasters we face:the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries,the gradual changes in our climate.Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest,so too might our subtlest fears be the truest.Read in the right way, our fears are an amazing giftof the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance,a way of glimpsing what might be the futurewhen there's still time to influence how that future will play out.Properly read, our fears can offer us something as preciousas our favorite works of literature:a little wisdom, a bit of insightand a version of that most elusive thing --the truth.Thank you.

julie_burstein_4_lessons_in_creativity

On my desk in my office, I keep a small clay potthat I made in college. It's raku, which is a kind of potterythat began in Japan centuries ago as a way ofmaking bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony.This one is more than 400 years old.Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay,and it was the imperfections that people cherished.Everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire.I just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itselftakes another day or two to cool down, but rakuis really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kilnup to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees,and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside,you can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off,and you reach in with these long metal tongs,you grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot potwould be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea,and you can imagine what that steam would smell like.But here in the United States, we ramp up the dramaa little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust,which catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail,and you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out.I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke.I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze,but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke,and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen,like this crackle pattern, because it's really stressfulon these pots. They go from 1,500 degreesto room temperature in the space of just a minute.Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity.I find in so many things that tension betweenwhat I can control and what I have to let gohappens all the time, whether I'm creating a new radio showor just at home negotiating with my teenage sons.When I sat down to write a book about creativity,I realized that the steps were reversed.I had to let go at the very beginning, and I had toimmerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artistsand writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listenedto these stories, I realized that creativitygrows out of everyday experiencesmore often than you might think, includingletting go.It was supposed to break, but that's okay. (Laughter) (Laughs)That's part of the letting go, is sometimes it happensand sometimes it doesn't, because creativity also growsfrom the broken places.The best way to learn about anythingis through stories, and so I want to tell you a storyabout work and play and about four aspects of lifethat we need to embracein order for our own creativity to flourish.The first embrace is something that we think,"Oh, this is very easy," but it's actually getting harder,and that's paying attention to the world around us.So many artists speak about needing to be open,to embrace experience, and that's hard to do whenyou have a lighted rectangle in your pocket thattakes all of your focus.The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing upin a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar,and here's a picture of one of the temples in her town.Mira Nair: In this little town, there were like 2,000 temples.We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew upin the rubble. The major thing that inspired me,that led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually,was traveling folk theater that would come through the townand I would go off and see these great battlesof good and evil by two people in a school fieldwith no props but with a lot of, you know,passion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing.You know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana,the two holy books, the epics that everything comes out ofin India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater,I knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform.Julie Burstein: Isn't that a wonderful story?You can see the sort of break in the everyday.There they are in the school fields, but it's good and evil,and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girlwith thousands of other people watching this performance,but she was ready. She was ready to open upto what it sparked in her, and it led her,as she said, down this path to becomean award-winning filmmaker.So being open for that experience that might change youis the first thing we need to embrace.Artists also speak about how some of their most powerful workcomes out of the parts of life that are most difficult.The novelist Richard Ford speaks abouta childhood challenge that continues to be somethinghe wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic.Richard Ford: I was slow to learn to read, went all the waythrough school not really reading more than the minimum,and still to this day can't read silentlymuch faster than I can read aloud,but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for mebecause when I finally did reconcile myself to how slowI was going to have to do it, then I think I came very slowlyinto an appreciation of all of those qualities of languageand of sentences that are not just the cognitiveaspects of language: the syncopations, the sounds of words,what words look like, where paragraphs break,where lines break. I mean, I wasn't so badly dyslexic thatI was disabled from reading. I just had to do itreally slowly, and as I did, lingering on those sentencesas I had to linger, I fell heir to language's other qualities,which I think has helped me write sentences.JB: It's so powerful. Richard Ford, who's won the Pulitzer Prize,says that dyslexia helped him write sentences.He had to embrace this challenge, and I use that wordintentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia.He had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the musicin language.Artists also speak about how pushing up againstthe limits of what they can do, sometimes pushinginto what they can't do, helps them focuson finding their own voice.The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how,as a young artist, he thought he was a painter,and he lived in Florence after graduate school.While he was there, he traveled to Madrid,where he went to the Prado to see this pictureby the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez.It's from 1656, and it's called "Las Meninas,"and it's the picture of a little princessand her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look overthat little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror,and reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queenof Spain, who would be standing where you might standto look at the picture.As he often did, Velázquez put himself in this painting too.He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one handand his palette in the other.Richard Serra: I was standing there looking at it,and I realized that Velázquez was looking at me,and I thought, "Oh. I'm the subject of the painting."And I thought, "I'm not going to be able to do that painting."I was to the point where I was using a stopwatchand painting squares out of randomness,and I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumpedall my paintings in the Arno, and I thought, I'm going to just start playing around.JB: Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly, you mighthave missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guywho'd been dead for 300 years, and realized,"I can't do that," and so Richard Serra went backto his studio in Florence, picked up all of his workup to that point, and threw it in a river.Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment,but he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City,and he put together a list of verbs— to roll, to crease, to fold —more than a hundred of them, and as he said,he just started playing around. He did these thingsto all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of leadand roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thingto rubber, and when he got to the direction "to lift,"he created this, which is in the Museum of Modern Art.Richard Serra had to let go of paintingin order to embark on this playful explorationthat led him to the work that he's known for today:huge curves of steel that require our time and motionto experience. In sculpture,Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting.He makes us the subject of his art.So experience and challengeand limitations are all things we need to embracefor creativity to flourish.There's a fourth embrace, and it's the hardest.It's the embrace of loss,the oldest and most constant of human experiences.In order to create, we have to stand in that spacebetween what we see in the world and what we hope for,looking squarely at rejection, at heartbreak,at war, at death.That's a tough space to stand in.The educator Parker Palmer calls it "the tragic gap,"tragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable,and my friend Dick Nodel likes to say,"You can hold that tension like a violin stringand make something beautiful."That tension resonates in the work of the photographerJoel Meyerowitz, who at the beginning of his career wasknown for his street photography, for capturing a momenton the street, and also for his beautiful photographsof landscapes -- of Tuscany, of Cape Cod,of light.Joel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many yearswas in Chelsea, with a straight view downtownto the World Trade Center, and he photographedthose buildings in every sort of light.You know where this story goes.On 9/11, Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town,but he raced back to the city, and raced down to the siteof the destruction.Joel Meyerowitz: And like all the other passersby,I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambersand Greenwich, and all I could see was the smokeand a little bit of rubble, and I raised my camerato take a peek, just to see if there was something to see,and some cop, a lady cop, hit me on my shoulder,and said, "Hey, no pictures!"And it was such a blow that it woke me up,in the way that it was meant to be, I guess.And when I asked her why no pictures, she said,"It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed."And I asked her, "What would happen if I was a memberof the press?" And she told me,"Oh, look back there," and back a block was the press corpstied up in a little penned-in area,and I said, "Well, when do they go in?"and she said, "Probably never."And as I walked away from that, I had this crystallization,probably from the blow, because it was an insult in a way.I thought, "Oh, if there's no pictures,then there'll be no record. We need a record."And I thought, "I'm gonna make that record.I'll find a way to get in, because I don't want tosee this history disappear."JB: He did. He pulled in every favor he could,and got a pass into the World Trade Center site,where he photographed for nine months almost every day.Looking at these photographs today brings backthe smell of smoke that lingered on my clotheswhen I went home to my family at night.My office was just a few blocks away.But some of these photographs are beautiful,and we wondered, was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitzto make such beauty out of such devastation?JM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerfuland tragic and horrific and everything, butit was also as, in nature, an enormous eventthat was transformed after the fact into this residue,and like many other ruins— you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace —and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather.I mean, there were afternoons I was down there,and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the airand you're standing in the rubble, and I found myselfrecognizing both the inherent beauty of natureand the fact that nature, as time,is erasing this wound.Time is unstoppable, and it transforms the event.It gets further and further away from the day,and light and seasons temper it in some way,and it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist.The reality is, there's the Woolworth Buildingin a veil of smoke from the site, but it's now like a scrimacross a theater, and it's turning pink,you know, and down below there are hoses spraying,and the lights have come on for the evening, and the wateris turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on,and I'm thinking, "My God, who could dream this up?"But the fact is, I'm there, it looks like that,you have to take a picture.JB: You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency,of the need to get to work, is so powerful in Joel's story.When I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently, I told him how muchI admired his passionate obstinacy, his determinationto push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work,and he laughed, and he said, "I'm stubborn,but I think what's more importantis my passionate optimism."The first time I told these stories, a man in the audienceraised his hand and said, "All these artists talk abouttheir work, not their art, which has got me thinking aboutmy work and where the creativity is there,and I'm not an artist." He's right. We all wrestlewith experience and challenge, limits and loss.Creativity is essential to all of us,whether we're scientists or teachers,parents or entrepreneurs.I want to leave you with anotherimage of a Japanese tea bowl. This oneis at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C.It's more than a hundred years old and you can still seethe fingermarks where the potter pinched it.But as you can also see, this one did breakat some point in its hundred years.But the person who put it back together,instead of hiding the cracks,decided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.This bowl is more beautiful now, having been broken,than it was when it was first made,and we can look at those cracks, becausethey tell the story that we all live,of the cycle of creation and destruction,of control and letting go, of picking up the piecesand making something new.Thank you. (Applause)



ruby_wax_what_s_so_funny_about_mental_illness
2175073

One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness,so if it was one, two, three, four, it's you, sir.You. Yeah. (Laughter)With the weird teeth. And you next to him. (Laughter)You know who you are.Actually, that whole row isn't right. (Laughter)That's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me. (Laughter)I am one of the one in four. Thank you.I think I inherit it from my mother, who,used to crawl around the house on all fours.She had two sponges in her hand, and then she had twotied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent. (Laughter)And she would crawl around behind me going,"Who brings footprints into a building?!"So that was kind of a clue that things weren't right.So before I start, I would like to thankthe makers of Lamotrigine, Sertraline, and Reboxetine,because without those few simple chemicals, I would not be vertical today.So how did it start?My mental illness -- well, I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness.What am I going to talk about? Okay.I always dreamt that, when I had my final breakdown,it would be because I had a deep Kafkaesqueexistentialist revelation,or that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it. (Laughter)But that's not what happened. I had my breakdownduring my daughter's sports day.There were all the parents sitting in a parking loteating food out of the back of their car -- only the English --eating their sausages. They loved their sausages. (Laughter)Lord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac,and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running,and all the mummies went, "Run! Run Chlamydia! Run!" (Laughter)"Run like the wind, Veruca! Run!"And all the girlies, girlies running, running, running,everybody except for my daughter, who was just standingat the starting line, just waving,because she didn't know she was supposed to run.So I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke upI found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates,I realized that I had found my people, my tribe. (Laughter)Because they became my only friends, they became my friends,because very few people that I knew -- Well, I wasn'tsent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean, if I had had a broken legor I was with child I would have been inundated,but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up.Perk up.Because I didn't think of that. (Laughter)(Laughter) (Applause)Because, you know, the one thing, one thing that you get with this disease,this one comes with a package, is you get a real sense of shame,because your friends go, "Oh come on, show me the lump,show me the x-rays," and of course you've got nothing to show,so you're, like, really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking,"I'm not being carpet-bombed. I don't live in a township."So you start to hear these abusive voices, but you don't hear one abusive voice,you hear about a thousand -- 100,000 abusive voices,like if the Devil had Tourette's, that's what it would sound like.But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil,there are no voices in your head.You know that when you have those abusive voices,all those little neurons get together and in that little gapyou get a real toxic "I want to kill myself" kind of chemical,and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape,you might have yourself depression.Oh, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg.If you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally,its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructivethat the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow,so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic.If a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes intosuch high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words,so he just feels the horror over and over again.So here's my question. My question is, how comewhen people have mental damage, it's always an active imagination?How come every other organ in your body can get sickand you get sympathy, except the brain?I'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain,because I know you like that here at TED,so if you just give me a minute here, okay.Okay, let me just say, there's some good news.There is some good news. First of all, let me say,we've come a long, long way.We started off as a teeny, teeny little one-celled amoeba,tiny, just sticking onto a rock, and now, voila, the brain.Here we go. (Laughter)This little baby has a lot of horsepower.It comes completely conscious. It's got state-of-the-art lobes.We've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world.We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world.Here we've got a little bit of long-term memory,so, you know that night you want to forget, when you got really drunk? Bye-bye! Gone. (Laughter)So actually, it's filled with 100 billion neuronsjust zizzing away, electrically transmitting information,zizzing, zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here.I don't know if you can get that here. (Laughter)So, zizzing away, and so — (Laughter) —And for every one — I know, I drew this myself. Thank you.For every one single neuron, you can actually havefrom 10,000 to 100,000 different connectionsor dendrites or whatever you want to call it, and every timeyou learn something, or you have an experience,that bush grows, you know, that bush of information.Can you imagine, every human being is carryingthat equipment, even Paris Hilton? (Laughter)Go figure.But I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news.This isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four.We are not equipped for the 21st century.Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth,and for people who say, oh, they're having a nice day,they're perfectly fine, they're more insane than the rest of us.Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitchesin evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you.When we were ancient man — (Laughter) —millions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatenedby a predator, okay? — (Laughter) —we would — Thank you. I drew these myself. (Laughter)Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)Thank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenalineand our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed,we'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel,and we'd go back to normal. Okay.So the problem is, nowadays, with modern man— (Laughter) —when we feel in danger, we still fill up with our own chemicalbut because we can't kill traffic wardens — (Laughter) —or eat estate agents, the fuel just stays in our bodyover and over, so we're in a constant state of alarm,a constant state. And here's another thing that happened.About 150,000 years ago, when language came online,we started to put words to this constant emergency,so it wasn't just, "Oh my God, there's a saber-toothed tiger,"which could be, it was suddenly, "Oh my God, I didn't send the email. Oh my God, my thighs are too fat.Oh my God, everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party!"So you've got this nagging loop tape that goesover and over again that drives you insane, so,you see what the problem is? What once made you safenow drives you insane.I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but somebody has to be.Your pets are happier than you are. (Laughter)(Applause)So kitty cat, meow, happy happy happy, human beings, screwed. (Laughter)Completely and utterly -- so, screwed.But my point is, if we don't talk about this stuff,and we don't learn how to deal with our lives, it's not goingto be one in four. It's going to be four in fourwho are really, really going to get ill in the upstairs department.And while we're at it, can we please stop the stigma?Thank you. (Applause)(Applause) Thank you.

I worked on a film called "Apollo 13,"and when I worked on this film, I discovered somethingabout how our brains work, and how our brains workis that, when we're sort of infused witheither enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever,it changes and alters our perception of things.It changes what we see. It changes what we remember.And as an experiment, because I dauntingly createa task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launchfor this particular movie, because I put it out there,I felt a little nervous about it, so I need to do an experimentand bring a group of people like this in a projection roomand play this stock footage, and when I played thisstock footage, I simply wanted to find outwhat people remembered, what was memorable about it?What should I actually try to replicate?What should I try to emulate to some degree?So this is the footage that I was showing everybody.And what I discovered is, because of the natureof the footage and the fact that we're doing this film,there was an emotion that was built into itand our collective memories of what this launch meant to usand all these various things.When I showed it, and I asked, immediately afterthe screening was over, what they thought of it,what was your memorable shots, they changed them.They were -- had camera moves on them.They had all kinds of things. Shots were combined,and I was just really curious, I mean, what the hellwere you looking at just a few minutes agoand how come, how'd you come up with this sort of description?And what I discovered is, what I should do is not actuallyreplicate what they saw, is replicate what they remembered.So this is our footage of the launch, based on, basically,taking notes, asking people what they thought, and thenthe combination of all the different shots and allthe different things put together created their sort ofcollective consciousness of what they rememberedit looked like, but not what it really looked like.So this is what we created for "Apollo 13."(Launch noises)So literally what you're seeing now is the confluenceof a bunch of different people, a bunch of different memories,including my own, of taking a little bit of libertywith the subject matter.I basically shot everything with short lenses,which means that you're very close to the action,but framed it very similarly to the long lens shotswhich gives you a sense of distance, so I was basicallywas setting up something that would remind youof something you haven't really quite seen before. (Music)And then I'm going to show you exactly what it isthat you were reacting to when you were reacting to it.(Music)Tom Hanks: Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.It's good to see you again. (Cheers) (Music)Rob Legato: I pretend they're clapping for me.(Laughter)So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can,and I'm basically recreating the launch withfire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threwin front of the lens to look like ice, and so basicallyif you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you,what you were reacting to, what you're emoting to,is something that's a total falsehood, and I found thatreally kind of fascinating.And in this particular case, this is the climax of the movie,and, you know, the weight of achieving it was simplytake a model, throw it out of a helicopter, and shoot it.And that's simply what I did.That's me shooting, and I'm a fairly mediocre operator,so I got that nice sense of verisimilitude, of a kind of,you know, following the rocket all the way down,and giving that little sort of edge, I was desperatelytrying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing.We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut,who was actually on some of the missions, of Apollo 15,and he was there to basically double check my science.And, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that.(Laughter)I don't know why, but they thought they did.So we were, he's a hero, he's an astronaut, andwe're all sort of excited, and, you know, I gave myselfthe liberty of saying, you know, some of the shots I diddidn't really suck that bad.And so maybe, you know, we were feeling kind of a littlegood about it, so I brought him in here, and he neededto really check and see what we were doing,and basically give us our A plus report card,and so I showed him some shots we were working on,and waiting for the reaction that you hope for,which is what I got. (Music) (Launch noises)So I showed him these two shots,and then he basically told me what he thought.("That's wrong") (Laughter)Okay. (Laughter)It's what you dream about.(Laughter)So what I got from him is, he turned to me and said,"You would never, ever design a rocket like that.You would never have a rocket go upwhile the gantry arms are going out. Can you imaginethe tragedy that could possibly happen with that?You would never, ever design a rocket like that."And he was looking at me. It's like, Yeah, I don't knowif you noticed, but I'm the guy out in the parking lotrecreating one of America's finest moments withfire extinguishers.(Laughter)And I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut,a hero, and I'm from New Jersey, so --(Laughter)I'm just going to show you some footage.I'm just going to show you some footage, and tell me what you think.And then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for.So I showed him this, and this is actual footagethat he was on. This is Apollo 15. This was his mission.So I showed him this, and the reaction I got was interesting.("That's wrong too.") (Laughter)So, and what happened was, I mean, what I sort of intunedin that is that he remembered it differently.He remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantrysystem, perfectly safe rocket launch, because he's sittingin a rocket that has, like, a hundred thousand poundsof thrust, built by the lowest bidder.He was hoping it was going to work out okay.(Laughter) (Applause)So he twisted his memory around.Now, Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin, who was noton the movie, so he had no idea that we were fakingany of this footage, and he just respondedas he would respond, and I'll run this.Ron Howard: Buzz Aldrin came up to meand said, "Hey, that launch footage, I saw some shotsI'd never seen before. Did you guys, what vault did you findthat stuff in?" And I said, "Well, no vault, Buzz,we generated all that from scratch."And he said, "Huh, that's pretty good. Can we use it?"(Explosion) ("Sure") (Laughter)RL: I think he's a great American.(Laughter)So, "Titanic" was, if you don't know the story,doesn't end well.(Laughter)Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic.So he basically set up, or basically shatteredthe suspension of disbelief, because what he photographedwas the real thing, a Mir sub going down, or actuallytwo Mir subs going down to the real wreck,and he created this very haunting footage.It's really beautiful, and it conjures up all thesevarious different emotions, but he couldn't photographeverything, and to tell the story,I had to fill in the gaps, which is now rather daunting,because now I have to recreate back to backwhat really happened and I had, I'm the only onewho could really blow it at that point.So this is the footage he photographed,and it was pretty moving and pretty awe-inspiring.So I'm going to just let it run, so you kind of absorbthis sort of thing, and I'll describe my sort of reactionswhen I was looking at it for the very first time.I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basicallysee it come back to life.I automatically wanted to see this ship,this magnificent ship, basically in all its glory,and conversely, I wanted to see it not in all its glory,basically go back to what it looks like.So I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show youwhat I tried to do, which is kind of the heart of the movie,for me, and so that's why I wanted to do the movie,that's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created.And I'll show you, you know, another thing that I foundinteresting is what we really were emoting towhen you take a look at it.So here's the behind the scenes, a couple of little shots here.So, when you saw my footage,you were seeing this: basically, a bunch of guysflipping a ship upside down, and the little Mir subsare actually about the size of small footballs,and shot in smoke.Jim went three miles went down, and I went aboutthree miles away from the studioand photographed this in a garage.And so, but what you're emoting to, or what you're lookingat, had the same feeling, the same haunting quality,that Jim's footage had, so I found it so fascinatingthat our brains sort of, once you believe something's real,you transfer everything that you feel about it,this quality you have, and it's totally artificial.It's totally make-believe, yet it's not to you,and I found that that was a very interesting thingto explore and use, and it caused me to create the nexteffect that I'll show you, which isthis sort of magic transition, and all I was really attemptingto do is basically have the audience cue the effect,so it became a seamless experience for them,that I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation,I was showing you what you wanted to see.And the very next shot, right after this --So you can see what I was doing.So basically, if there's two subs in the same shot,I shot it, because where's the camera coming from?And when Jim shot it, it was only one sub,because he was photographing from the other,and I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this.I'll give it to Jim, because he could use the pat on the back.(Laughter)Okay. So now the Titanic transition.So this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basicallymagically transplant from one state of the Titanicto the other. So I'll just play the shot once. (Music)(Music)And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you.Gloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.RL: So, what I did is basically I had anotherscreening room experience where I was basically trackingwhere I was looking, or where we were looking,and of course you're looking at the two people on the bowof the ship, and then at some point,I'm changing the periphery of the shot,I'm changing, it's becoming the rusted wreck,and then I would run it every day, and then I would findexactly the moment that I stopped looking at themand start noticing the rest of it, and the momentmy eye shifted, we just marked it to the frame.The moment my eye shifted, I immediately startedto change them, so now somehow you missedwhere it started and where it stopped.And so I'll just show it one more time.(Music) And it's literally done by using what our brainsnaturally do for us, which is, as soon as you shiftyour attention, something changes, and then I leftthe little scarf going, because it really wanted to bea ghostly shot, really wanted to feel like they were stillon the wreck, essentially. That's where they were buried forever.Or something like that. I just made that up.(Laughter)It was, incidentally, the last time I ever saw daylight.It was a long film to work on. (Laughter)Now, "Hugo" was another interesting movie, becausethe movie itself is about film illusions.It's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistenceof vision that creates a motion picture,and one of the things I had to do is, we —Sasha Baron Cohen is a very clever, very smart guy,comedian, wanted to basically do an homage to the kind ofthe Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things, and he wantedhis leg brace to get caught on a moving train.Very dangerous, very impossible to do, and particularlyon our stage, because there literally is no way to actuallymove this train, because it fits so snugly into our set.So let me show you the scene, and then I basicallyused the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein,which is, if you have a camera that's moving with a movingobject, what is not moving appears to be moving,and what is moving appears to be stopped,so what you're actually seeing now is the train is notmoving at all, and what is actually moving is the floor.So this is the shot. That's a little video ofwhat you're looking at there, which is our little test,so that's actually what you're seeing, and I thought it wassort of an interesting thing, because it was, partof the homage of the movie itself is coming up with thissort of genius trick which I can't take credit for.I'd love to but I can't, because it was inventedlike in 1910 or something like that, is I told Marty,and it's kind of one of those mind things that it'sreally hard to really get until you actually see it work,and I said, you know, what I was going to do, and he said,"So, let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels?That doesn't move."(Laughter) (Applause)"And the thing without the wheels, that moves."Precisely. (Laughter)Brings me to the next, and final --Marty's not going to see this, is he? (Laughter)This isn't viewed outside of -- (Laughter)The next illustration is something that, there's likeall one shot theory. It's a very elegant way of telling a story,especially if you're following somebody on a journey,and that journey basically tells something abouttheir personality in a very concise way,and what we wanted to do based on the shot in "Goodfellas,"which is one of the great shots ever,a Martin Scorsese film, of basically following Henry Hillthrough what it feels like to be a gangster walkgoing through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way.He was the master of his universe, and we wanted Hugoto feel the same way, so we created this shot.(Music)That's Hugo. (Music)And we felt that if we could basically move the camerawith him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boywho is basically the master of his universe,and his universe is, you know, behind the scenesin the bowels of this particular train stationthat only he can actually navigate throughand do it this way, and we had to make it feel thatthis is his normal, everyday sort of life,so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important,and of course, in shooting in 3D, which is basicallyit's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick,so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task,and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you gotwhen you saw the "Goodfellas" shot.So what you're now going to see is how we actually did it.It's actually five separate sets shot at five different timeswith two different boys.The one on the left is where the shot ends,and the shot on the right is where it takes over,and now we switch boys, so it went from Asa Butterfield,who's the star of the show, to his stand-in. (Music)I wouldn't say his stunt double. There's a crazy rigthat we built for this. (Music)And so this is, and now this is set number threewe're into, and then we're going to go into, basicallythe very last moment of the shot is actuallythe steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranesand various things like that, and it literally was doneover five different sets, two different boys, different times,and it all had to feel like it was all one shot, and what wassort of great for me was it was probablythe best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on,and, you know, I was kind of proud of it when I was done,which is, you should never really be proud of stuff, I guess.So I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine,and said, "You know, this is, you know, kind ofthe best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on.What do you think was the reason?"And he said, "Because no one knowsyou had anything to do with it."(Laughter)So, all I can say is, thank you,and that's my presentation for you. (Applause)(Applause)

I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from.And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of yousuffer from it as well.When I'm walking around an art gallery,rooms and rooms full of paintings,after about 15 or 20 minutes,I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.I'm not connecting to them.Instead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffeeI desperately need to wake me up.I'm suffering from gallery fatigue.How many of you out there suffer from --yes. Ha ha, ha ha!Now, sometimes you might last longerthan 20 minutes, or even shorter,but I think we all suffer from it. And do you havethe accompanying guilt?For me, I look at the paintings on the walland I think, somebody has decided to put them there,thinks they're good enough to be on that wall,but I don't always see it.In fact, most of the time I don't see it.And I leave feeling actually unhappy.I feel guilty and unhappy with myself,rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting,I think there's something wrong with me.And that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that.(Laughter)The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break.If you think about going into a restaurant,when you look at the menu, are you expected to orderevery single thing on the menu?No! You select.If you go into a department store to buy a shirt,are you going to try on every single shirtand want every single shirt?Of course not, you can be selective. It's expected.How come, then, it's not so expectedto be selective when we go to an art gallery?Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting?Well I'm trying to take a different approach.And there's two things I do:When I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast,and I look at everything, and I pinpoint the onesthat make me slow down for some reason or other.I don't even know why they make me slow down, but somethingpulls me like a magnetand then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting.So it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.I choose a painting. It might just be one painting in 50.And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting,and I tell myself a story about it.Why a story? Well, I think that we are wired,our DNA tells us to tell stories.We tell stories all the time about everything,and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place,and sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit,trying to bring some order to it.Why not apply that to our looking at paintings?So I now have this sort of restaurant menuvisiting of art galleries.There are three paintings I'm going to show you nowthat are paintings that made me stop in my tracksand want to tell stories about them.The first one needs little introduction --"Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer,17th-century Dutch painter.This is the most glorious painting.I first saw it when I was 19,and I immediately went out and got a poster of it,and in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone,I never tire of looking at her.What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin withwas just the gorgeous colors he usesand the light falling on her face.But I think what's kept me still coming backyear after year is another thing, and that isthe look on her face, the conflicted look on her face.I can't tell if she's happy or sad,and I change my mind all the time.So that keeps me coming back.One day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall,I lay in bed and looked at her,and I suddenly thought, I wonder whatthe painter did to her to make her look like that.And it was the first time I'd ever thought thatthe expression on her face is actually reflectinghow she feels about him.Always before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl.Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.And I thought, well, what is that relationship?So I went to find out. I did some research and discovered,we have no idea who she is.In fact, we don't know who any of the modelsin any of Vermeer's paintings are,and we know very little about Vermeer himself.Which made me go, "Yippee!"I can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to.So here's how I came up with the story.First of all, I thought,I've got to get her into the house.How does Vermeer know her?Well, there've been suggestions thatshe is his 12-year-old daughter.The daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.And I thought, no, it's a very intimate look,but it's not a look a daughter gives her father.For one thing, in Dutch painting of the time,if a woman's mouth was open, it was indicating sexual availability.It would have been inappropriate for Vermeerto paint his daughter like that.So it's not his daughter, but it's somebodyclose to him, physically close to him.Well, who else would be in the house?A servant, a lovely servant.So, she's in the house.How do we get her into the studio?We don't know very much about Vermeer,but the little bits that we do know, one thing we knowis that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her motherin a house where he had his own roomwhere he -- his studio. He also had 11 children.It would have been a chaotic, noisy household.And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before,you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet.How does a painter paint such calm, quiet paintings with 11 kids around?Well, he compartmentalizes his life.He gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.Not the wife, not the kids. Okay, the maid can come in and clean."She's in the studio. He's got her in the studio, they're together.And he decides to paint her.He has her wear very plain clothes.Now, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintingswore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials.This is very plain; the only thing that isn't plainis her pearl earring.Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afforda pair of pearl earrings.So those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they?We happen to know, there's a list of Catharina, the wife's clothes.Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur,a yellow and black bodice,and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings,different women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings.So clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.It's not such a leap of faith to takethat that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife.So we've got all the elements for our story.She's in the studio with him for a long time.These paintings took a long time to make.They would have spent the time alone, all that time.She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.She's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted.And does the wife know? Maybe not.And if she doesn't, well --that's the story.(Laughter)The next painting I'm going to talk aboutis called "Boy Building a House of Cards" by Chardin.He's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes,but he did occasionally paint people.And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting,different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.I like this version the best, because some of the boysare older and some are younger, and to me, this one,like Goldilocks's porridge, is just right.He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience,and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.The light comes in from the left, his face is bathedin this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting,and you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it,I was standing there going,"Look at me. Please look at me."And he didn't look at me. He was still looking at his cards,and that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is,he's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us.And that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece,of a painting when there's a lack of resolution.He's never going to look at me.So I was thinking of a story where,if I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him?Not the painter, I don't want to think about the painter.I'm thinking of an older version of himself.He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant,saying, "Look at me. I want to warn you aboutwhat you're about to go through. Please look at me."And he never does.And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" --we don't know if she's happy or sad.I've written an entire novel about her,and I still don't know if she's happy or sad.Again and again, back to the painting,looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily,but not really, and we come back again and again.The last painting I'm going to talk aboutis called "Anonymous" by anonymous. (Laughter)This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury,and then they discovered that it wasn't him,and they have no idea who it is.Now, in the National Portrait Gallery,if you don't know the biography of the painting,it's kind of useless to you.They can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.So unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage,along with quite a number of other orphans,some of them some beautiful paintings.This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons:One is the disconnection between his mouththat's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.He's not happy, and why isn't he happy?The second thing that really attracted mewere his bright red cheeks.He is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made!This must be a guy who blushes all the time.What is he thinking about that's making him blush?The third thing that made me stop in my tracksis his absolutely gorgeous doublet.Silk, gray, those beautiful buttons.And you know what it makes me think of,is it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed.I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks,and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him,and I thought, is that what he's thinking about?And I thought, if I'm going to make a story,what's the last thing I'm going to put in there?Well, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with?And I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay.He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance, with his heir.Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?You put all those together, and you've got your storyto fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.Now, here's the story.It's short."Rosy"I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me.It has a plain high collar, detachable sleevesand intricate buttons of twisted silk thread,set close together so that the fit is snug.The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.Perhaps that was the intention.I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor.I knew even before I stood up to speakthat my cheeks were inflamed.I have always flushed easily, from physical exertion,from wine, from high emotion.As a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys,but not by George.Only George could call me Rosy.I would not allow anyone else.He managed to make the word tender.When I made the announcement, George did notturn rosy, but went pale as my doublet.He should not have been surprised.It has been a common assumptionthat I would one day marry his cousin.But it is difficult to hear the words aloud.I know, I could barely utter them.Afterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.Despite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale.We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces."What do you think of my doublet?" I asked.He glanced at me. "That collar looks to be strangling you.""We will still see each other," I insisted."We can still hunt and play cards and attend court.Nothing need change."George did not speak."I am 23 years old. It is time for me to marryand produce an heir. It is expected of me."George drained another glass of claret and turned to me."Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James.I'm sure you'll be content together."He never used my nickname again.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)



neil_harbisson_i_listen_to_color
2275114

Well, I was born with a rare visual conditioncalled achromatopsia, which is total color blindness,so I've never seen color,and I don't know what color looks like,because I come from a grayscale world.To me, the sky is always gray,flowers are always gray,and television is still in black and white.But, since the age of 21,instead of seeing color, I can hear color.In 2003, I started a projectwith computer scientist Adam Montandon,and the result, with further collaborationswith Peter Kese from Sloveniaand Matias Lizana from Barcelona,is this electronic eye.It's a color sensor that detectsthe color frequency in front of me — (Frequency sounds) —and sends this frequency to a chip installedat the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of methrough the bone, through bone conduction.(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like —This is the sound of purple. (Frequency sounds)For example, this is the sound of grass. (Frequency sounds)This is red, like TED. (Frequency sounds)This is the sound of a dirty sock. (Laughter)Which is like yellow, this one.So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years,since 2004, so I find it completely normal nowto hear color all the time.At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you givefor each color, so I had to memorize the notes,but after some time, all this informationbecame a perception.I didn't have to think about the notes.And after some time, this perception became a feeling.I started to have favorite colors,and I started to dream in colors.So, when I started to dream in color is when I feltthat the software and my brain had united,because in my dreams, it was my brain creatingelectronic sounds. It wasn't the software,so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic devicewas no longer a device.It had become a part of my body,an extension of my senses,and after some time, it even became a partof my official image.This is my passport from 2004.You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passportswith electronic equipment, but I insistedto the passport office that what they were seeingwas actually a new part of my body,an extension of my brain, and they finally accepted meto appear with the passport photo.So, life has changed dramatically since I hear color,because color is almost everywhere,so the biggest change for example isgoing to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso,for example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall,because I can listen to the paintings.And supermarkets, I find this is very shocking,it's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.It's like going to a nightclub.It's full of different melodies. (Laughter) Yeah.Especially the aisle with cleaning products.It's just fabulous. (Laughter)Also, the way I dress has changed.Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.Now I dress in a way that it sounds good. (Laughter)(Applause)So today I'm dressed in C major,so it's quite a happy chord. (Laughter)If I had to go to a funeral, though,I would dress in B minor, which would beturquoise, purple and orange. (Laughter)Also, food, the way I look at food has changed,because now I can display the food on a plate,so I can eat my favorite song. (Laughter)So depending on how I display it,I can hear and I can compose music with food.So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like,Lady Gaga salads as starters. (Laughter) I mean,this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.And also, some Rachmaninov piano concertosas main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts,that would be a very exciting restaurantwhere you can actually eat songs.Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed,because when I look at someone, I hear their face,so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite,the other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like,sound portraits of people.Instead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape,I point at them with the eye and I write downthe different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits.Here's some faces.(Musical chords)Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. (Laughter)Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.They have similar sound of eyes.So you relate people that you wouldn't relate,and you can actually also create concertsby looking at the audience faces.So I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.The good thing about this is,if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.It's not my fault, because — (Laughter)And so another thing that happens is thatI started having this secondary effectthat normal sounds started to become color.I heard a telephone tone, and it felt greenbecause it sounded just like the color green.The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise,and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience,so I started to paint music and paint people's voices,because people's voices have frequenciesthat I relate to color.And here's some music translated into color.For example, Mozart, "Queen of the Night," looks like this.(Music) Very yellow and very colorful,because there's many different frequencies.(Music)And this is a completely different song.(Music) It's Justin Bieber's "Baby." (Laughter)(Music)It is very pink and very yellow.So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color,for example, these are two very well-known speeches.One of them is Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream,"and the other one is Hitler.And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition hallswithout labels, and then I ask people,"Which one do you prefer?"And most people change their preferencewhen I tell them that the one on the left is Hitlerand the one on the right is Martin Luther King.So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors,just like human vision.I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.But then, I just thought thatthis human vision wasn't good enough.There's many, many more colors around usthat we cannot perceive,but that electronic eyes can perceive.So I decided to continue extending my color senses,and I added infrared and I added ultravioletto the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colorsthat the human eye cannot perceive.For example, perceiving infrared is good because you canactually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is thatyou can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe,because ultraviolet is a dangerous color,a color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wishto perceive things that we cannot perceive.That's why, two years ago,I created the Cyborg Foundation,which is a foundation that tries to help peoplebecome a cyborg, tries to encourage peopleto extend their sensesby using technology as part of the body.We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses,so if we extend our senses,we will consequently extend our knowledge.I think life will be much more excitingwhen we stop creating applications for mobile phonesand we start creating applications for our own body.I think this will be a big, big changethat we will see during this century.So I do encourage you all to think about which sensesyou'd like to extend.I would encourage you to become a cyborg.You won't be alone. Thank you. (Applause)(Applause)

Waste of life.time that I encouraged them to spend.When we're on our deathbeds,It's true.Hospice workers,the top five regrets of the dying.Number one:I wish I hadn't worked so hard.Number two:Number three:I wish I had let myself be happier.Number four:And number five:I wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams,instead of what others expected of me.that games actually help us fulfill.Hundreds of millions of peoplethat we would otherwise grow distant from,if we weren't playing games together."I wish I'd let myself be happier."Just 30 minutes of online game play a dayand long-term increases in happiness.of a gamer with his avatar.changes how we think and act in real life,making us more courageous, more ambitious,more committed to our goals."I wish I'd led a life true to my dreams,and not what others expected of me."Are games doing this yet?We're going to come back to this one.about deathbed regrets?I've never been on my deathbed.Really wanting to die.Now let me tell you that story.The concussion didn't heal properly,nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.I had to rest it.no reason to live.(Laughter)Of course it's meant to be funny,with traumatic brain injuries.It said, "The pain will never end."and I will never forget this moment --I said, "I am either going to kill myselfor I'm going to turn this into a game."Now, why a game?that when we play a game --more determination, more optimism,so I created a role-playing recovery gamecalled Jane the Concussion Slayer.Now this became my new secret identity,and I want you to play with me."This was an easier way to ask for help.She became my first ally in the game,my husband Kiyash joined next,We also collected and activated power-ups.to feel just a little bit good,just a little bit productive.Now the game was that simple:But even with a game so simple,It just vanished.

And then I --That was the first thing I learned,and then I started progressing to other things.And I started watching Kaki King a lot,and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence,so then I started watching his videos,and it's very surreal right now to be --(Laughter)(Applause)CA: Was that piece just now,that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?UR: I'd never learned it before,but he told me that we would be playing that on stage,so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it.And it finally happened, so ...(Laughter)CA: Preston, from your point of view,I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?How does it feel to see someone like thiscome along taking your art and doing so much with it?Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing,and I feel really proud, really honored.And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool.(Laughter)CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do?Can you?

raghava_kk_what_s_your_200_year_plan
794758

About 75 years ago,my grandfather, a young man,walked into a tentthat was converted into amovie theater like that,and he fell hopelessly in lovewith the woman he saw on thesilver screen: none other than Mae West,the heartthrob of the '30s,and he could never forget her.In fact, when he had his daughtermany years later, he wanted toname her after Mae West,but can you imagine an Indianchild name Mae West?The Indian family said, no way!So when my twin brother Kaesavawas born, he decided to tinkerwith the spelling of Keshava's name.He said, if Mae West can be M-A-E,why can't Keshava be K-A-E?So he changed Kaesava's spelling.Now Kaesava had a baby boycalled Rehan a couple of weeks ago.He decided to spell, or, rather,misspell Raehan with an A-E.You know, my grandfather diedmany years ago when I waslittle, but his love for MaeWest lives on as a misspellingin the DNA of his progeny.That for me is successful legacy. (Laughs)You know, as for me,my wife and I have our owncrazy legacy project.We actually sit every few years,argue, disagree, fight,and actually come up with ourvery own 200-year plan.Our friends think we're mad.Our parents think we're cuckoo.Because, you know, we bothcome from families that reallylook up to humility and wisdom,but we both like to livelarger than life.I believe in the concept ofa Raja Yogi: Be a dude beforeyou can become an ascetic.This is me being a rock star,even if it's in my own house.You know?So when Netra and I sat downto make our first plan10 years ago, we saidwe want the focus of this planto go way beyond ourselves.What do we mean by beyond ourselves?Well 200 years, we calculated,is at the end of our directcontact with the world.There's nobody I'll meet inmy life will ever live beyond200 years, so we thoughtthat's a perfect place wherewe should situate our plan andlet our imagination take flight.You know, I never reallybelieved in legacy. What am Igoing to leave behind? I'm an artist.Until I made a cartoon about 9/11.It caused so much trouble for me.I was so upset.You know, a cartoon that wasmeant to be a cartoon of the weekended up staying so much longer.Now I'm in the business ofcreating art that willdefinitely even outlive me, andI think about what I want toleave behind through those paintings.You know, the 9/11 cartoonupset me so much that I decidedI'll never cartoon again.I said, I'm never going to make anyhonest public commentary again.But of course I continuedcreating artwork that was honestand raw, because I forgot abouthow people reacted to my work.You know, sometimes forgettingis so important to remain idealistic.Perhaps loss of memory is socrucial for our survivalas human beings.One of the most important thingsin my 200-year plan that Netraand I write is what to forgetabout ourselves.You know, we carry so muchbaggage, from our parents,from our society, from so manypeople -- fears, insecurities -- andour 200-year plan really listsall our childhood problems that we have to expire.We actually put an expiry dateon all our childhood problems.The latest date I put was,I said, I am going to expiremy fear of my leftist, feministmother-in-law, and thistoday is the date! (Laughs)She's watching. (Laughter)Anyway, you know, I reallymake decisions all the timeabout how I want to remembermyself, and that's the most importantkind of decisions I make.And this directly translatesinto my paintings.But like my friends, I can dothat really well on Facebook,Pinterest, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube.Name it, I'm on it.I've started outsourcing mymemory to the digital world,you know? But that comeswith a problem.It's so easy to think oftechnology as a metaphorfor memory, but our brainsare not perfect storage deviceslike technology.We only remember what wewant to. At least I do.And I rather think of our brainsas biased curators of ourmemory, you know? And iftechnology is not a metaphor formemory, what is it?Netra and I use our technologyas a tool in our 200-year planto really curate our digital legacy.That is a picture of my mother,and she recently got a Facebook account.You know where this is going.And I've been very supportiveuntil this picture shows upon my Facebook page. (Laughter)And I actually untagged myselffirst, then I picked up thephone. I said, "Mom, you willnever put a picture of mein a bikini ever again."And she said, "Why? You lookso cute, darling." I said,"You just don't understand."Maybe we are among the firstgeneration that really understandsthis digital curating of ourselves.Maybe we are the first to evenactively record our lives.You know, whether youagree with, you know, legacyor not, we are actually leavingbehind digital traces all the time.So Netra and I really wantedto use our 200-year planto curate this digital legacy,and not only digital legacybut we believe in curatingthe legacy of my pastand future.How, you may ask?Well, when I think of the future,I never see myself moving forwardin time. I actually see timemoving backward towards me.I can actually visualizemy future approaching.I can dodge what I don't wantand pull in what I want.It's like a video game obstaclecourse. And I've gotten better and betterat doing this. Even when I makea painting, I actually imagineI'm behind the painting,it already exists, andsomeone's looking at it,and I see whether they'refeeling it from their gut.Are they feeling it from theirheart, or is it just a cerebral thing?And it really informs my painting.Even when I do an art show,I really think about, what shouldpeople walk away with?I remember when I was 19,I did, I wanted to do my firstart exhibition, and I wanted thewhole world to know about it.I didn't know TED then,but what I did was I closedmy eyes tight, and I starteddreaming. I could imagine peoplecoming in, dressed up, lookingbeautiful, my paintings with allthe light, and in my visualizationI actually saw a very famousactress launching my show,giving credibility to me.And I woke up from myvisualization and I said,who was that? I couldn't tellif it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha,two very famous Indian actresses,like the Meryl Streeps of India.As it turned out, next morningI wrote a letter to both of them,and Shabana Azmi replied,and came and launchedmy very first show 12 years ago.And what a bang it startedmy career with! You know,when we think of time in thisway, we can curate not only thefuture but also the past.This is a picture of my family,and that is Netra, my wife.She's the co-creator of my200-year plan.Netra's a high school historyteacher. I love Netra,but I hate history.I keep saying, "Nets, you livein the past while I'll createthe future, and when I'm done,you can study about it."(Laughter)She gave me an indulgent smile,and as punishment, she said,"Tomorrow I'm teaching a classon Indian history, and you aresitting in it, and I'm grading you."I'm like, "Oh, God." I went.I actually went and sat inon her class. She started bygiving students primary sourcedocuments from India, Pakistan,from Britain, and I said,"Wow." Then she asked them toseparate fact from bias.I said, "Wow," again.Then she said, "Choose yourfacts and biases and create animage of your own storyof dignity."History as an imaging tool?I was so inspired.I went and created my ownversion of Indian history.I actually included stories frommy grandmother.She used to work for thetelephone exchange, and she usedto actually overhear conversationsbetween Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten.And she used to hear allkinds of things she shouldn'thave heard. But, you know,I include things like that.This is my version of Indian history.You know, if thisis so, it occurred to me thatmaybe, just maybe, the primaryobjective of our brainsis to serve our dignity.Go tell Facebook tofigure that out!Netra and I don't write our200-year plan for someone elseto come and execute itin 150 years. Imagine receivinga parcel saying, from the past,okay now you're supposed tospend the rest of your lifedoing all of this. No.We actually write it onlyto set our attitudes right.You know, I used to believethat education is the mostimportant tool to leavea meaningful legacy.Education is great.It really teaches us whowe are, and helps uscontextualize ourselvesin the world, but it's reallymy creativity that's taught methat I can be much morethan what my education told me I am.I'd like to makethe argument that creativity isthe most important tool we have.It lets us create who we are,and curate what is to come.I like to think -- Thank you.I like to think of myselfas a storyteller, where my pastand my future are only stories,my stories, waiting to be toldand retold. I hope all of youone day get a chance toshare and write your own200-year story.Thank you so much.Shukran! (Applause)



rives_reinventing_the_encyclopedia_game
701705

So, last month, the Encyclopaedia Britannica announcedthat it is going out of printafter 244 years, which made me nostalgic,because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown libraryback when I was a kid,maybe 12 years old.And I wondered if I could update that game,not just for modern methods,but for the modern me.So I tried.I went to an online encyclopedia,Wikipedia, and I entered the term "Earth."You can start anywhere, this time I chose Earth.And the first rule of the game is pretty simple.You just have to read the articleuntil you find something you don't know,and preferably something your dad doesn't even know.And in this case, I quickly found this:The furthest point from the center of the Earthis not the tip of Mount Everest, like I might have thought,it's the tip of this mountain: Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.The Earth spins, of course, as it travels around the sun,so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle,like some Earthlings.And even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes,it's one degree away from the equator,it's riding that bulge, and so the summit of Chimborazois the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth.And it is really fun to say.So I immediately decided,this is going to be the name of the game,or my new exclamation.You can use it at TED.Chimborazo, right?It's like "eureka" and "bingo" had a baby.I didn't know that;that's pretty cool.Chimborazo!So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple.You just have to find another term and look that up.Now in the old days, that meant getting out a volumeand browsing through it alphabetically,maybe getting sidetracked,that was fun.Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from.I can go literally anywhere in the world,I think since I was already in Ecuador,I just decided to click on the word "tropical."That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropicsthat encircles the Earth.Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the northand the Tropic of Capricorn in the south,that much I knew,but I was surprised to learn this little fact:Those are not cartographers' lines,like latitude or the borders between nations,they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt,and they change.They move; they go up, they go down.In fact, for years, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricornhave been steadily drifting towards the equatorat the rate of about 15 meters per year,and nobody told me that.I didn't know it.Chimborazo!So to keep the game going, I just have to find another term and look that one up.Since I'm already in the tropics, I chose "Tropical rainforest."Famous for its diversity, human diversity.There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet.They're all over the globe, but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests.This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get "friended."The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end.It mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and thencoleoptera,which turn out to be beetles.Now I clicked on this on purpose,but if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake,it does remind me, for the band, see "The Beatles,"for the car see "Volkswagon Beetle,"but I am here for beetle beetles.This is the most successful order on the planet by far.Something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet,including plants, are beetles.That means the next time you are in the grocery store,take a look at the four people ahead of you in line.Statistically, one of you is a beetle.And if it is you, you are astonishingly well adapted.There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums.There are predator beetles, that attack other insectsand still look pretty cute to us.There are beetles that roll little balls of dunggreat distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings.This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri,who renews the ball of the sun every morning,which is how that dung-rolling scarabbecame that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun.Beetles, I was reminded, have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom.Fireflies are not flies, fireflies are beetles.Fireflies are coleoptera, and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well.Like my next link:The chemical language of pheromones.Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex.Yeah.(Laughter)And the link to aphrodisiac.Now that's something that increases sexual desire,possibly chocolate.There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylaminethat might be an aphrodisiac.But as the article mentions,because of enzyme breakdown,it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally.So those of you who only eat your chocolate, you might have to experiment.The link I clicked on here,"sympathetic magic," mostly because I understand what both of those words mean.But not when they're together like that.I do like sympathy. I do like magic.So when I click on "sympathetic magic,"I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls.This is the boy in me getting lucky again.Sympathetic magic is imitation.If you imitate something, maybe you can have an effect on it.That's the idea behind voodoo dolls, and possibly also cave paintings.The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind.I would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves.We've got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork.Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands,usually the left hand.We have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia,so even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his handor blow pigment on it from a tube,I can easily picture how he did it.And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatarright there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for "hand,"go to the page for "hand," where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of triviaI've found in a long time. It's simply this:The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar.Now that's embarrassing, because up until now,every time I've said, "I know it like the back of my hand,"I've really been saying, "I'm totally familiar with that,I just don't know it's freaking name, right?"And the link I clicked on here,well, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar.I click on chimpanzee, and I get our closest genetic relative.Pan troglodytes, the name we give him, means "cave dweller."He doesn't.He lives in rainforests and savannas.It's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us,evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us,and in some cases, he gets places before us.Like my next link, the almost irresistible link, Ham the Astrochimp.I click on him, and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice, in fact.He's born in Cameroon,which is smack in the middle of my tropics map,and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles.In between those two landmarks in Ham's life,he flew into space.He experienced weightlessness and re-entrymonths before the first human being to do it,Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.When I click on Yuri Gagarin's page,I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature,huge in heroism.Top estimates, Soviet estimates, put this guy at 1.65 meters,that is less than five and a half feet tall max,possibly because he was malnourished as a child.Germans occupied Russia.A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household,and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut.Years later, the boy from that cramped mud hutwould grow up to be the man in that cramped capsuleon the tip of a rocketwho volunteered to be launched into outer space,the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet.And he didn't just leave it,he circled it once.Fifty years later, as a tribute,the International Space Station, which is still up there tonight,synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit,at the exact same time of day,and filmed it,so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutesof what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride,possibly a lonely one,the first person to ever see such a thing.And then when you've had your fill of that,you can click on one more link.You can come back to Earth.You return to where you started.You can finish your game.You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know.And for me, I quickly landed on this one:The Earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid,which is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls.This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy.I found it myself.It's got some math that I can do.I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it.What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball,if you could take planet Earth, with all its mountain tops and cavesand rainforests, astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees, voodoo dolls,fireflies, chocolate, sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea,you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball,it would be as smooth as a billiard ball,presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle.That's pretty cool.I didn't know that.Chimborazo!Thank you.(Applause)

Good evening.We are in this wonderfulopen-air amphitheaterand we are enjoying ourselvesin that mild eveningtemperature tonight,but when Qatar will hostthe football World Cup10 years from now,2022,we already heard it will bein the hot, very hot and sunnysummer months of June and July.And when Qatar has been assignedto the World Cup all, manypeople around the world have beenwondering, how would it bepossible that football playersshow spectacular football,run around in this desertclimate? How would it bepossible that spectators sit,enjoy themselves in open-airstadia in this hot environment?Together with the architects ofAlbert Speer &amp; Partner, our engineersfrom Transsolar have beensupporting, have been developingopen-air stadia based on 100 percentsolar power, on 100 percent solar cooling.Let me tell you about that,but let me start with comfort.Let me start with the aspectof comfort, because many peopleare confusingambient temperaturewith thermal comfort.We are used to looking at charts likethat, and you see this red lineshowing the air temperaturein June and July, and yes, that's right,it's picking up to 45 degrees C.It's actually very hot.But air temperature is notthe full set of climaticparameters which define comfort.Let me show you analysisa colleague of mine did lookingon different football, World Cups,Olympic Games around the world,looking on the comfortand analyzing the comfortpeople have perceived at thesedifferent sport activities,and let me start with Mexico.Mexico temperature has been, airtemperature has been something between15, up to 30 degrees C, and peopleenjoyed themselves.It was a very comfortable gamein Mexico City. Have a look.Orlando, same kind of stadium,open-air stadium. People havebeen sitting in the strong sun,in the very high humidityin the afternoon, and theydid not enjoy. It was not comfortable.The air temperature was not too high, but it was notcomfortable during these games.What about Seoul? Seoul, becauseof broadcast rights, all thegames have been in the lateafternoon. Sun has already beenset, so the games have beenperceived as comfortable.What about Athens? Mediterraneanclimate, but in the sun it wasnot comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort.And we know that from Spain,we know that "sol y sombra."If you have a ticket, and youget a ticket for the shade,you pay more, because you'rein a more comfortable environment.What about Beijing?It's again, sun in the dayand high humidity,and it was not comfortable.So if I overlay, and if youoverlay all these comfortenvelopes, what we see is,in all these places, air temperature hasbeen ranging something from 25to 35, and if you go onthe line, 30, of 30 degrees Cambient temperatures. If yougo along that line you seethere has been all kind ofcomfort, all kinds of perceivedoutdoor comfort, ranging fromvery comfortableto very uncomfortable.So why is that?This is because there aremore parameters influencingour thermal comfort, which isthe sun, the direct sun,the diffuse sun, which is wind,strong wind, mild wind, which isair humidity, which isthe radiant temperature of thesurroundings where we are in.And this is air temperature.All these parameters go intothe comfort feeling of ourhuman body, and scientistshave developed a parameter,which is the perceivedtemperature, where all theseparameters go in and helpdesigners to understandwhich is the driving parameterthat I feel comfort or thatI don't feel comfort.Which is the driving parameterwhich gives me a perceivedtemperature? And these parameters,these climatic parameters arerelated to the human metabolism.Because of our metabolism,we as human beings,we produce heat.I'm excited, I'm talking to you,I'm probably producing150 wattsat the moment. You are sitting,you are relaxed, you're lookingat me. It's probably 100watts each person is producing,and we need to get rid of thatenergy. I need, with my body,to get rid of the energy, andthe harder it is for myself,for my body, to get rid of theenergy, the less comfort I feel.That's it. And if I don'tget rid of the energy,I will die.If we overlay what happensduring the football World Cup,what will happen in June, July,we will see, yes, airtemperature will be much higher,but because the games andthe plays will be in the afternoon,it's probably the same comfortrating we've found in otherplaces which has perceivedas non-comfortable.So we sat together with a teamwhich prepared the Bid Book, or goal,that we said, let's aimfor perceived temperature,for outdoor comfort in this range,which is perceived with atemperature of 32 degreesCelsius perceived temperature,which is extremely comfortable.People would feel really finein an open outdoor environment.But what does it mean?If we just look on what happens,we see, temperature's too high.If we apply the best architectural design,climate engineering design,we won't get much better.So we need to do something active.We need, for instance, to bringin radiant cooling technology,and we need to combine thiswith so-called soft conditioning.And how does it look like in a stadium?So the stadium has a fewelements which create thatoutdoor comfort. First of all,it's shading. It needsto protect where the peopleare sitting against strongand warm wind.But that's not all what we needto do. We need to useactive systems.Instead of blowing a hurricaneof chilled air through the stadium,we can use radiantcooling technologies, like afloor heating system where waterpipes are embedded in the floor.And just by using cold watergoing through the water pipes,you can release the heatwhich is absorbed during the dayin the stadium, so you cancreate that comfort, and then byadding dry air instead ofdown-chilled air, the spectatorsand the football players canadjust to their individualcomfort needs, to theirindividual energy balance.They can adjust and findtheir comfort they need to find.There are 12 stadia probablyto come, but there are32 training pitches whereall the individual countriesare going to train.We applied the same concept:shading of the training pitch,using a shelter against wind,then using the grass.Natural-watered lawn is avery good cooling sourcestabilizing temperature,and using dehumidified air tocreate comfort.But even the best passive designwouldn't help.We need active system.And how do we do that?Our idea for the bid was100 percent solar cooling,based on the idea that we usethe roof of the stadia,we cover the roofs of the stadiawith PV systems.We don't borrow any energyfrom history.We are not using fossil energies.We are not borrowing energyfrom our neighbors.We're using energy we can harveston our roofs, and also on thetraining pitches, which will becovered with large, flexiblemembranes, and we will seein the next years an industrycoming up with flexiblephotovoltaics, givingthe possibilities of shadingagainst strong sun and producingelectric energy in the same time.And this energy now isharvested throughout the year,sent into the grid,is replacing fossilsin the grid, and when I need itfor the cooling, I take itback from the grid and Iuse the solar energywhich I have brought to the gridback when I needit for the solar cooling.And I can do that in the firstyear and I can balance thatin the next 10, and the next20 years, this energy,which is necessary to conditiona World Cup in Qatar,the next 20 years, this energygoes into the grid of Qatar.So this -- (Applause)Thank you very much. (Applause)This is not only usefulfor stadia. We can use that alsoin open-air places and streets,and we've been working onthe City of the Futurein Masdar, which is in theUnited Emirates, Abu Dhabi.And I had the pleasure to workon the central plaza.And the same idea to use there,to create outdoor conditionswhich are perceivedas comfortable. People enjoygoing there instead of goinginto a shopping mall, which ischilled down and which iscooled. We wanted to createan outdoor spacewhich is so comfortable thatpeople can go there in theearly afternoon, even in thesesunny and hot summer months,and they can enjoy and meet therewith their families. (Applause)And the same concept:shade against the sun,shade against the wind,and use, use and take advantageof the sun you can harveston your footprint.And these beautiful umbrellas.So I'd like to encourage youto pay attention to yourthermal comfort, to yourthermal environment,tonight and tomorrow,and if you'd like to learn moreabout that, I invite youto go to our website.We uploaded a very simpleperceived temperature calculatorwhere you can check outabout your outdoor comfort.And I also hope that youshare the idea thatif engineers and designerscan use all these differentclimatic parameters,it will be possible to createreally good and comfortableoutdoor conditions,to change our thermal perceptionthat we feel comfortablein an outdoor environment,and we can do thatwith the best passive design,but also using the energy sourceof the site in Qatar which isthe sun.(Applause)Thank you very much.

Good evening.We are in this wonderfulopen-air amphitheaterand we are enjoying ourselvesin that mild eveningtemperature tonight,but when Qatar will hostthe football World Cup10 years from now,2022,we already heard it will bein the hot, very hot and sunnysummer months of June and July.And when Qatar has been assignedto the World Cup all, manypeople around the world have beenwondering, how would it bepossible that football playersshow spectacular football,run around in this desertclimate? How would it bepossible that spectators sit,enjoy themselves in open-airstadia in this hot environment?Together with the architects ofAlbert Speer &amp; Partner, our engineersfrom Transsolar have beensupporting, have been developingopen-air stadia based on 100 percentsolar power, on 100 percent solar cooling.Let me tell you about that,but let me start with comfort.Let me start with the aspectof comfort, because many peopleare confusingambient temperaturewith thermal comfort.We are used to looking at charts likethat, and you see this red lineshowing the air temperaturein June and July, and yes, that's right,it's picking up to 45 degrees C.It's actually very hot.But air temperature is notthe full set of climaticparameters which define comfort.Let me show you analysisa colleague of mine did lookingon different football, World Cups,Olympic Games around the world,looking on the comfortand analyzing the comfortpeople have perceived at thesedifferent sport activities,and let me start with Mexico.Mexico temperature has been, airtemperature has been something between15, up to 30 degrees C, and peopleenjoyed themselves.It was a very comfortable gamein Mexico City. Have a look.Orlando, same kind of stadium,open-air stadium. People havebeen sitting in the strong sun,in the very high humidityin the afternoon, and theydid not enjoy. It was not comfortable.The air temperature was not too high, but it was notcomfortable during these games.What about Seoul? Seoul, becauseof broadcast rights, all thegames have been in the lateafternoon. Sun has already beenset, so the games have beenperceived as comfortable.What about Athens? Mediterraneanclimate, but in the sun it wasnot comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort.And we know that from Spain,we know that "sol y sombra."If you have a ticket, and youget a ticket for the shade,you pay more, because you'rein a more comfortable environment.What about Beijing?It's again, sun in the dayand high humidity,and it was not comfortable.So if I overlay, and if youoverlay all these comfortenvelopes, what we see is,in all these places, air temperature hasbeen ranging something from 25to 35, and if you go onthe line, 30, of 30 degrees Cambient temperatures.

This sound,this smell,this sightall remind me of the campfires of my childhood,when anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames.There was this wondrous endingwhen people and fire fell asleep almost in unison.It was dreaming time.Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming,although I'm known to make my dreams come true.Last year, I created a one-man show.For an hour and a half I shared with the audiencea lifetime of creativity,how I pursue perfection, how I cheat the impossible.And then TED challenged me:"Philippe, can you shrink this lifetime to 18 minutes?"(Laughter)Eighteen minutes, clearly impossible.But here I am.One solution was to rehearse a machine gun deliveryin which every syllable, every second will have its importanceand hope to God the audience will be able to follow me.No, no, no.No, the best way for me to startis to pay my respects to the gods of creativity.So please join me for a minute of silence.Okay, I cheated, it was a mere 20 seconds.But hey, we're on TED time.When I was six years old,I fell in love with magic.For Christmas I got a magic boxand a very old book on card manipulation.Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulationthan in all the silly little tricks in the box.So I looked in the book for the most difficult move,and it was this.Now I'm not supposed to share that with you,but I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand.Now that manipulationwas broken down into seven movesdescribed over seven pages.One, two, three,four, five, six and seven.And let me show you something else.The cards were bigger than my hands.Two months later, six years old,I'm able to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.And I go to see a famous magicianand proudly ask him, "Well what do you think?"Six years old.The magician looked at me and said, "This is a disaster.You cannot do that in two secondsand have a minuscule part of the card showing.For the move to be professional, it has to be less than one secondand it has to be perfect."Two years later, one -- zoop.And I'm not cheating. It's in the back. It's perfect.Passion is the mottoof all my actions.As I'm studying magic,juggling is mentioned repeatedlyas a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination.Now I had long admired how fast and fluidlyjugglers make objects fly.So that's it. I'm 14; I'm becoming a juggler.I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe,and he agrees to sell me three clubs.But in America you have to explain. What are clubs?Nothing to do with golf.They are those beautiful oblong objects,but quite difficult to make.They have to be precisely lathed.Oh, when I was buying the clubs,somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others.Well I didn't think much of it at the time.Anyway, here I was progressing with my new clubs.But I could not understand.I was pretty fast, but I was not fluid at all.The clubs were escaping me at each throw.And I was trying constantly to bring them back to me.Until one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn,the world's greatest juggler.And he was frowning.And he finally asked, "Can I see those?"So I proudly showed him my clubs.He said, "Philippe, you have been had.These are rejects. They are completely out of alignment.They are impossible to juggle."Tenacity is how I kept at itagainst all odds.So I went to the circus to see more magicians, more jugglers,and I saw -- oh no, no, no, I didn't see.It was more interesting; I heard.I heard about those amazing men and womenwho walk on thin air --the high-wire walkers.Now I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood,so that's it. I'm 16; I'm becoming a wire walker.I found two trees --but not any kind of trees,trees with character --and then a very long rope.And I put the rope around and aroundand around and around and around till I had no more rope.Now I have all of those ropes parallel like this.I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers,and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path.So I just created the widest tightrope in the world.What did I need? I needed the widest shoes in the world.So I found some enormous, ridiculous, giant ski bootsand then wobbly, wobbly I get on the ropes.Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing.So I cut one rope off.And the next day one rope off.And a few days later, I was practicing on a single tightrope.Now you can imagine at that timeI had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers.So that is how -- in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try --this is how not to learn wire walking.(Laughter)Intuition is a tool essential in my life.In the meantime, I am being thrown out of five different schoolsbecause instead of listening to the teachers,I am my own teacher, progressing in my new artand becoming a street juggler.On the high wire, within months,I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus,except I am not satisfied.I was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection.But nobody wanted to hire me.So I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission.Notre Dame,the Sydney Harbor Bridge,the World Trade Center.And I developed a certitude, a faiththat convinced me that I will get safely to the other side.If not, I will never do that first step.Well nonetheless,on the top of the World Trade Centermy first step was terrifying.All of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same.Manhattan no longer spreads its infinity.The murmur of the city dissolves into a squallwhose chilling power I no longer feel.I lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge.I step over the beam.I put my left foot on the cable,the weight of my body raised on my right leganchored to the flank of the building.Shall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left?My right leg will be unburdened,my right foot will freely meet the wire.On one side, a mass of a mountain, a life I know.On the other, the universe of the clouds,so full of unknown we think it's empty.At my feet, the path to the north tower -- 60 yards of wire rope.It's a straight line, which sags,which sways, which vibrates,which rolls on itself,which is ice,which is three tons tight, ready to explode,ready to swallow me.An inner howl assails me,the wild longing to flee.But it is too late.The wire is ready.Decisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable.Faith is what replaces doubtin my dictionary.So after the walkpeople ask me, "How can you top that?"Well I didn't have that problem.I was not interested in collecting the gigantic,in breaking records.In fact, I put my World Trade Center crossingat the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks --or some completely different type of performance.Let's see, such as my street juggling, for example.So each timeI draw my circle of chalk on the pavementand enter as the improvising comic silent characterI created 45 years ago,I am as happy as when I am in the clouds.But this here,this is not the street.So I cannot street juggle here, you understand.So you don't want me to street juggle here, right?You know that, right?You don't want me to juggle, right?(Applause)(Music)(Applause)Thank you. Thank you.Each time I street juggleI use improvisation.Now improvisation is empoweringbecause it welcomes the unknown.And since what's impossible is always unknown,it allows me to believe I can cheat the impossible.Now I have done the impossible not once,but many times.So what should I share? Oh, I know. Israel.Some years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festivalby a high-wire walk.And I chose to put my wirebetween the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalemover the Ben Hinnom Valley.And I thought it would be incredibleif in the middle of the wireI stopped and, like a magician,I produce a dove and send her in the skyas a living symbol of peace.Well now I must say,it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel, but I got one.And in my hotel room,each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air,she would graze the wall and end up on the bed.So I said, now it's okay. The room is too small.I mean, a bird needs space to fly.It will go perfectly on the day of the walk.Now comes the day of the walk.Eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley.The mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, comes to wish me the best.But he seemed nervous.There was tension in my wire,but I also could feel tension on the ground.Because all those peoplewere made up of people who, for the most part,considered each other enemies.So I start the walk. Everything is fine.I stop in the middle.I make the dove appear.People applaud in delight.And then in the most magnificent gesture,I send the bird of peace into the azure.But the bird, instead of flying away,goes flop, flop, flop and lands on my head.(Laughter)And people scream.So I grab the dove,and for the second time I send her in the air.But the dove, who obviously didn't go to flying school,goes flop, flop, flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole.(Laughter)You laugh, you laugh. But hey.I sit down immediately. It's a reflex of wire walkers.Now in the meantime, the audience, they go crazy.They must think this guy with this dove,he must have spent years working with him.What a genius, what a professional.(Laughter)So I take a bow. I salute with my hand.And at the end I bang my hand against the poleto dislodge the bird.Now the dove, who, now you know, obviously cannot fly,does for the third time a little flop, flop, flopand ends up on the wire behind me.And the entire valley goes crazy.Now but hold on, I'm not finished.So now I'm like 50 yards from my arrivaland I'm exhausted, so my steps are slow.And something happened.Somebody somewhere, a group of people,starts clapping in rhythm with my steps.And within seconds the entire valleyis applauding in unison with each of my steps.But not an applause of delight like before,an applause encouragement.For a moment, the entire crowd had forgotten their differences.They had become one, pushing me to triumph.I want you just for a secondto experience this amazing human symphony.So let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival.So I walk, you clap, everybody in unison.(Clapping)(Applause)So after the walk, Teddy and I become friends.And he tells me, he has on his desk a picture of mein the middle of the wire with a dove on my head.He didn't know the true story.And whenever he's daunted by an impossible situationto solve in this hard-to-manage city,instead of giving up, he looks at the picture and he says,"If Philippe can do that, I can do this,"and he goes back to work.Inspiration.By inspiring ourselveswe inspire others.I will never forget this music,and I hope now neither will you.Please take this music with you home,and start gluing feathers to your armsand take off and fly,and look at the world from a different perspective.And when you see mountains,remember mountains can be moved.(Applause)Thank you. Thank you.Thank you.(Applause)

Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled,because, you see, my father's name was Ted,and much of my life, especially my musical life,is really a talk that I'm still having with him,or the part of me that he continues to be.Now Ted was a New Yorker, an all-around theater guy,and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician.He didn't read a note,and he was profoundly hearing impaired.Yet, he was my greatest teacher.Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids,his understanding of music was profound.And for him, it wasn't so much the way the music goesas about what it witnesses and where it can take you.And he did a painting of this experience,which he called "In the Realm of Music."Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvisingin a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this.(Music)But he was tough when it came to music.He said, "There are only two things that matter in music:what and how.And the thing about classical music,that what and how, it's inexhaustible."That was his passion for the music.Both my parents really loved it.They didn't know all that much about it,but they gave me the opportunity to discover ittogether with them.And I think inspired by that memory,it's been my desire to try and bring itto as many other people as I can,sort of pass it on through whatever means.And how people get this music, how it comes into their lives,really fascinates me.One day in New York, I was on the streetand I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants.And a tough, slouchy kid got up to bat,and he took a swing and really connected.And he watched the ball fly for a second,and then he went, "Dah dadaratatatah.Brah dada dadadadah."And he ran around the bases.And I thought, go figure.How did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainmentturn into the victory crow of this New York kid?How was that passed on? How did he get to hear Mozart?Well when it comes to classical music,there's an awful lot to pass on,much more than Mozart, Beethoven or Tchiakovsky.Because classical musicis an unbroken living traditionthat goes back over 1,000 years.And every one of those yearshas had something unique and powerful to say to usabout what it's like to be alive.Now the raw material of it, of course,is just the music of everyday life.It's all the anthems and dance crazesand ballads and marches.But what classical music doesis to distill all of these musics down,to condense them to their absolute essence,and from that essence create a new language,a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchinglyabout who we really are.It's a language that's still evolving.Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of,like concertos and symphonies,but even the most ambitious masterpiececan have as its central missionto bring you back to a fragile and personal moment --like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto.(Music)It's so simple, so evocative.So many emotions seem to be inside of it.Yet, of course, like all music,it's essentially not about anything.It's just a design of pitches and silence and time.And the pitches, the notes, as you know, are just vibrations.They're locations in the spectrum of sound.And whether we call them 440 per second, A,or 3,729, B flat -- trust me, that's right --they're just phenomena.But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomenais complex and emotional and not totally understood.And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries,as have our preferences for them.So for example, in the 11th century,people liked pieces that ended like this.(Music)And in the 17th century, it was more like this.(Music)And in the 21st century ...(Music)Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord,even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed youor sent some of you running from the room.And the reason you like itis because you've inherited, whether you knew it or not,centuries-worth of changesin musical theory, practice and fashion.And in classical music we can follow these changes very, very accuratelybecause of the music's powerful silent partner,the way it's been passed on: notation.Now the impulse to notate,or, more exactly I should say, encode musichas been with us for a very long time.In 200 B.C., a man named Sekuloswrote this song for his departed wifeand inscribed it on her gravestonein the notational system of the Greeks.(Music)And a thousand years later,this impulse to notate took an entirely different form.And you can see how this happenedin these excerpts from the Christmas mass "Puer Natus est nobis,""For Us is Born."(Music)In the 10th century, little squiggles were usedjust to indicate the general shape of the tune.And in the 12th century, a line was drawn, like a musical horizon line,to better pinpoint the pitch's location.And then in the 13th century, more lines and new shapes of noteslocked in the concept of the tune exactly,and that led to the kind of notation we have today.Well notation not only passed the music on,notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely,because it enabled the musiciansto imagine music on a much vaster scale.Now inspired moves of improvisationcould be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized,made into intricate designs.And from this moment, classical music becamewhat it most essentially is,a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature:instinct and intelligence.And there began to be a real difference at this pointbetween the art of improvisationand the art of composition.Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move,but a composer is considering all possible moves,testing them out, prioritizing them out,until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent designof ultimate and enduring coolness.Now some of the greatest composers, like Bach,were combinations of these two things.Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master.Mozart was the same way.But every musician strikes a different balancebetween faith and reason, instinct and intelligence.And every musical era had different priorities of these things,different things to pass on, different 'whats' and 'hows'.So in the first eight centuries or so of this traditionthe big 'what' was to praise God.And by the 1400s, music was being writtenthat tried to mirror God's mindas could be seen in the design of the night sky.The 'how' was a style called polyphony,music of many independently moving voicesthat suggested the way the planets seemed to movein Ptolemy's geocentric universe.This was truly the music of the spheres.(Music)This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known.And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenitymeant that something new had to happen --a radical new move, which in 1600 is what did happen.(Music) Singer: Ah, bitter blow!Ah, wicked, cruel fate!Ah, baleful stars!Ah, avaricious heaven!MTT: This, of course, was the birth of opera,and its development put music on a radical new course.The what now was not to mirror the mind of God,but to follow the emotion turbulence of man.And the how was harmony,stacking up the pitches to form chords.And the chords, it turned out,were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions.And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us,the triads,either the major one,which we think is happy,or the minor one,which we perceive as sad.But what's the actual difference between these two chords?It's just these two notes in the middle.It's either E natural,and 659 vibrations per second,or E flat, at 622.So the big difference between human happiness and sadness?37 freakin' vibrations.So you can see in a system like thisthere was enormous subtle potentialof representing human emotions.And in fact, as man began to understand morehis complex and ambivalent nature,harmony grew more complex to reflect it.Turns out it was capable of expressing emotionsbeyond the ability of words.Now with all this possibility,classical music really took off.It's the time in which the big forms began to arise.And the effects of technology began to be felt also,because printing put music, the scores, the codebooks of music,into the hands of performers everywhere.And new and improved instrumentsmade the age of the virtuoso possible.This is when those big forms arose --the symphonies, the sonatas, the concertos.And in these big architectures of time,composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime.A piece like Beethoven's Fifthbasically witnessing how it was possiblefor him to go from sorrow and anger,over the course of a half an hour,step by exacting step of his route,to the moment when he could make it across to joy.(Music)And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues,like gripping ones of culture,such as nationalism or quest for freedomor the frontiers of sensuality.But whatever direction the music took,one thing until recently was always the same,and that was when the musicians stopped playing,the music stopped.Now this moment so fascinates me.I find it such a profound one.What happens when the music stops?Where does it go? What's left?What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance?Is it a melody or a rhythmor a mood or an attitude?And how might that change their lives?To me this is the intimate, personal side of music.It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it.And to me that's the most essential of all.Mostly it's been a person-to-person thing,a teacher-student, performer-audience thing,and then around 1880 came this new technologythat first mechanically then through analogs then digitallycreated a new and miraculous way of passing things on,albeit an impersonal one.People could now hear music all the time,even though it wasn't necessaryfor them to play an instrument, read music or even go to concerts.And technology democratized music by making everything available.It spearheaded a cultural revolutionin which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing.And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes,using computers and synthesizersto create works of intellectually impenetrable complexitybeyond the means of performers and audiences.At the same time technology,by taking over the role that notation had always played,shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligenceway over to the instinctive side.The culture in which we live nowis awash with music of improvisationthat's been sliced, diced, layeredand, God knows, distributed and sold.What's the long-term effect of this on us or on music?Nobody knows.The question remains: What happens when the music stops?What sticks with people?Now that we have unlimited access to music, what does stick with us?Well let me show you a story of what I meanby "really sticking with us."I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home,and I spied a very shaky old manmaking his way across the room on a walker.He came over to a piano that was there,and he balanced himself and began playing something like this.(Music)And he said something like, "Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven."And I suddenly got it,and I said, "Friend, by any chance are you trying to play this?"(Music)And he said, "Yes, yes. I was a little boy.The symphony: Isaac Stern, the concerto, I heard it."And I thought, my God,how much must this music mean to this manthat he would get himself out of his bed, across the roomto recover the memory of this musicthat, after everything else in his life is sloughing away,still means so much to him?Well, that's why I take every performance so seriously,why it matters to me so much.I never know who might be there, who might be absorbing itand what will happen to it in their life.But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possibleof sharing this music.That's what drives my interest in projectslike the TV series "Keeping Score" with the San Francisco Symphonythat looks at the backstories of music,and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphonyon projects that explore the potentialof the new performing arts centersfor both entertainment and education.And of course, the New World Symphonyled to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internetthat reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world.And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype.There's just a role here for so many people --teachers, parents, performers --to be explorers together.Sure, the big events attract a lot of attention,but what really matters is what goes on every single day.We need your perspectives, your curiosity, your voices.And it excites me now to meet peoplewho are hikers, chefs, code writers, taxi drivers,people I never would have guessed who loved the musicand who are passing it on.You don't need to worry about knowing anything.If you're curious, if you have a capacity for wonder, if you're alive,you know all that you need to know.You can start anywhere. Ramble a bit.Follow traces. Get lost. Be surprised, amused inspired.All that 'what', all that 'how' is out therewaiting for you to discover its 'why',to dive in and pass it on.Thank you.(Applause)



tavi_gevinson_a_teen_just_trying_to_figure_it_out
1322545

Four years ago today, exactly, actually,I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.Last September of 2011, I started an online magazinefor teenage girls called Rookiemag.com.My name's Tavi Gevinson, andthe title of my talk is "Still Figuring It Out,"and the MS Paint quality of my slideswas a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme,and has nothing to do with my inabilityto use PowerPoint. (Laughter)So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot aboutwhat makes a strong female character,and, you know, movies and TV shows,these things have influence. My own website.So I think the question of what makes a strong femalecharacter often goes misinterpreted,and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomenwho maybe have one quality that's played up a lot,like a Catwoman type,or she plays her sexuality up a lot,and it's seen as power.But they're not strong characters who happen to be female.They're completely flat,and they're basically cardboard characters.The problem with this is that thenpeople expect women to be that easy to understand,and women are mad at themselvesfor not being that simple,when, in actuality, women are complicated,women are multifaceted -- not because women are crazy,but because people are crazy,and women happen to be people. (Laughter)So the flaws are the key.I'm not the first person to say this.What makes a strong female characteris a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws,who is maybe not immediately likable,but eventually relatable.I don't like to acknowledge a problemwithout also acknowledging those who work to fix it,so just wanted to acknowledge shows like "Mad Men,"movies like "Bridesmaids," whose female charactersor protagonists are complex, multifaceted.Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBOthat premiers next month, "Girls,"she said she wanted to start it because she felt thatevery woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions,and that feels accurate for all people,but you don't see women represented like that as much.Congrats, guys. (Laughs)But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some typesof women who are not represented that way,and one group that we'll focus on today are teens,because I think teenagers are especially contradictoryand still figuring it out,and in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks"and "My So-Called Life," and their characters,Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase,I mean, the whole premise of the showswere just them trying to figure themselves out, basically,but those shows only lasted a season each,and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since.So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — (Laughter) —around the time when I was,when I started watching those TV shows.I was ending middle school, starting high school --I'm a sophomore now —and I was trying to reconcileall of these differences that you're told you can't bewhen you're growing up as a girl.You can't be smart and pretty.You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sakeof what other people, usually men, will think of you.So I was trying to figure all that out,and I felt a little confused,and I said so on my blog,and I said that I wanted to starta website for teenage girlsthat was not this kind of one-dimensionalstrong character empowerment thingbecause I think one thing that can be very alienatingabout a misconception of feminism is thatgirls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up tobeing perfectly consistent in your beliefs,never being insecure, never having doubts,having all of the answers. And this is not true,and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feelingbecame easier once I understood that feminismwas not a rulebook but a discussion,a conversation, a process,and this is a spread from a zine that I made last yearwhen I -- I mean, I think I've let myself go a biton the illustration front since.But, yeah.So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publicationfor teenage girls and ask people to submittheir writing, their photography, whatever,to be a member of our staff.I got about 3,000 emails.My editorial director and I went through them andput together a staff of people,and we launched last September.And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter,where I say that Rookie, we don't have all the answers,we're still figuring it out too, but the point is not togive girls the answers, and not even give them permissionto find the answers themselves,but hopefully inspire them to understand thatthey can give themselves that permission,they can ask their own questions, find their own answers,all of that, and Rookie, I think we've been trying to make ita nice place for all of that to be figured out.So I'm not saying, "Be like us,"and "We're perfect role models," because we're not,but we just want to help represent girlsin a way that shows those different dimensions.I mean, we have articles called"On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You,"but we also have articles like,oops -- I'm figuring it out!Ha ha. (Laughter)If you use that, you can get away with anything.We also have articles called"How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes."So all of that being said, I still really appreciatethose characters in movies andarticles like that on our site,that aren't just about being totally powerful,maybe finding your acceptance with yourselfand self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.So what I you to take away from my talk,the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.Like, that's all you have to do. (Laughter)Because my favorite thing about her,other than, like, everything, is thatshe is very -- has always beenunapologetically present on stage,and unapologetic about her flawsand about reconciling all of her contradictory feelingsand she makes you listen to them and think about them,and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.Thank you. (Applause)

Five hundred seventy-one milliontwo hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towelsare used by Americansevery year.If we could -- correction, wrong figure --13 billion used every year.If we could reduce the usage of paper towels,one paper towel per person per day,571,230,000 pounds of paper not used.We can do that.Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers.There's the tri-fold. People typically take two or three.There's the one that cuts it, that you have to tear off.People go one, two, three, four, tear.This much, right?There's the one that cuts itself.People go, one, two, three, four.Or there's the same thing, but recycled paper,you have to get five of those because they're not as absorbant, of course.The fact is, you can do it all with one towel.The key, two words:This half of the room, your word is "shake."Let's hear it. Shake. Louder.Audience: Shake.Joe Smith: Your word is "fold."Audience: Fold.JS: Again.Audience: Fold. JS: Really loud.Audience: Shake. Fold.JS: Okay. Wet hands.Shake -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.Why 12? Twelve apostles, twelve tribes,twelve zodiac signs, twelve months. The one I like the best:It's the biggest number with one syllable.(Laughter)Tri-fold. Fold ...Dry.(Applause)Audience: Shake.Fold.JS: Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is importantbecause it allows interstitial suspension.You don't have to remember that part, but trust me.(Laughter)Audience: Shake. Fold.JS: Cuts itself.You know the funny thing is,I get my hands drier than people do with three or four,because they can't get in between the cracks.If you think this isn't as good...Audience: Shake. Fold.JS: Now, there's now a real fancy invention,it's the one where you wave your handand it kicks it out.It's way too big a towel.Let me tell you a secret.If you're really quick, if you're really quick --and I can prove this --this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building.How? As soon as it starts, you just tear it off.It's smart enough to stop.And you get half a towel.Audience: Shake. Fold.JS: Now, let's all say it together. Shake. Fold.You will for the rest of your life remember those wordsevery time you pick up a paper towel.And remember, one towel per person for one year --571,230,000 pounds of paper. No small thing.And next year, toilet paper.(Laughter)

If you had caught me straight out of collegein the halls of the Vermont State Housewhere I was a lobbyist in trainingand asked me what I was going to do with my life,I would have told youthat I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi,the Chinese equivalency exam,and I was going to go study law in Beijing,and I was going to improve U.S.-China relationsthrough top-down policy changesand judicial system reforms.(Laughter)(Applause)I had a plan,and I never ever thoughtit would have anything to dowith the banjo.Little did I knowwhat a huge impact it would have on me one nightwhen I was at a partyand I heard a sound coming out of a record playerin the corner of a room.And it was Doc Watsonsinging and playing "Shady Grove."♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫♫ Shady Grove, my darlin' ♫♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫♫ Going back to Harlan ♫That sound was just so beautiful,the sound of Doc's voiceand the rippling groove of the banjo.And after being totally and completely obsessedwith the mammoth richness and historyof Chinese culture,it was like this total reliefto hear something so truly Americanand so truly awesome.I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.So before going to law school in ChinaI bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truckand I traveled down through Appalachiaand I learned a bunch of old American songs,and I ended up in Kentuckyat the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention.And I was sitting in a hallway one nightand a couple girls came up to me.And they said, "Hey, do you want to jam?"And I was like, "Sure."So I picked up my banjoand I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them.And a record executive walked up to meand invited me to Nashville, Tennessee to make a record.(Laughter)It's been eight years,and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer.In fact, I went to Nashville.And after a few months I was writing songs.And the first song I wrote was in English,and the second one was in Chinese.(Music)[Chinese]Outside your door the world is waiting.Inside your heart a voice is calling.The four corners of the world are watching,so travel daughter, travel.Go get it, girl.(Applause)It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky.And I've played thousands of shows.And I've collaboratedwith so many incredible, inspirational musicians around the world.And I see the power of music.I see the power of musicto connect cultures.I see it when I stand on a stagein a bluegrass festival in east Virginiaand I look out at the sea of lawn chairsand I bust out into a song in Chinese.[Chinese]And everybody's eyes just pop wide openlike it's going to fall out of their heads.And they're like, "What's that girl doing?"And then they come up to me after the showand they all have a story.They all come up and they're like,"You know, my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to Chinaand adopted a girl."And I tell you what, it like everybody's got a story.It's just incredible.And then I go to Chinaand I stand on a stage at a universityand I bust out into a song in Chineseand everybody sings alongand they roar with delightat this girlwith the hair and the instrument,and she's singing their music.And I see, even more importantly,the power of music to connect hearts.Like the time I was in Sichuan Provinceand I was singing for kids in relocation schoolsin the earthquake disaster zone.And this little girl comes up to me.[Chinese]"Big sister Wong,"Washburn, Wong, same difference."Big sister Wong, can I sing you a songthat my mom sang for mebefore she was swallowed in the earthquake?"And I sat down,she sat on my lap.She started singing her song.And the warmth of her bodyand the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks,and I started to cry.And the light that shone off of her eyeswas a place I could have stayed forever.And in that moment, we weren't our American selves,we weren't our Chinese selves,we were just mortalssitting together in that light that keeps us here.I want to dwell in that lightwith you and with everyone.And I know U.S.-China relationsdoesn't need another lawyer.Thank you.(Applause)

marco_tempest_a_magical_tale_with_augmented_reality
1373946

Marco Tempest: What I'd like to show you todayis something in the way of an experiment.Today's its debut.It's a demonstration of augmented reality.And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.They are liveand reacting to me in real time.I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.So fingers crossed.And keep your eyes on the big screen.Augmented realityis the melding of the real worldwith computer-generated imagery.It seems the perfect mediumto investigate magicand ask, why, in a technological age,we continue to havethis magical sense of wonder.Magic is deception,but it is a deception we enjoy.To enjoy being deceived,an audience must firstsuspend its disbelief.It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridgewho first suggested this receptive state of mind.Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writingto produce for these shadows of the imaginationa willing suspension of disbeliefthat, for a moment,constitutes poetic faith.MT: This faith in the fictional is essentialfor any kind of theatrical experience.Without it,a script is just words.Augmented realityis just the latest technology.And sleight of handis just an artful demonstrationof dexterity.We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.We do it every day,while reading novels,watching televisionor going to the movies.We willingly enter fictional worldswhere we cheer our heroesand cry for friends we never had.Without this abilitythere is no magic.It was Jean Robert-Houdin,France's greatest illusionist,who first recognized the role of the magicianas a storyteller.He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio.Jean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler.He is an actor playing the part of a magician.MT: Which means magic is theaterand every trickis a story.The tricks of magicfollow the archetypes of narrative fiction.There are tales of creation and loss,death and resurrection,and obstacles that must be overcome.Now many of them are intensely dramatic.Magicians play with fire and steel,defy the fury of the buzzsaw,dare to catch a bulletor attempt a deadly escape.But audiences don't come to see the magician die,they come to see him live.Because the best storiesalways have a happy ending.The tricks of magic have one special element.They are stories with a twist.Now Edward de Bono arguedthat our brains are pattern matching machines.He said that magicians deliberately exploitthe way their audiences think.Edward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost whollyon the momentum error.The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborationsthat are perfectly reasonable,but do not, in fact, matchwhat is being done in front of them.MT: In that respect,magic tricks are like jokes.Jokes lead us down a pathto an expected destination.But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flipsinto something entirely unexpected,we laugh.The same thing happenswhen people watch magic tricks.The finaledefies logic,gives new insight into the problem,and audiences express their amazementwith laughter.It's fun to be fooled.One of the key qualities of all storiesis that they're made to be shared.We feel compelled to tell them.When I do a trick at a party --(Laughter)that person will immediately pull their friend overand ask me to do it again.They want to share the experience.That makes my job more difficult,because, if I want to surprise them,I need to tell a story that starts the same,but ends differently --a trick with a twiston a twist.It keeps me busy.Now experts believethat stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained.We think in narrative structures.We connect events and emotionsand instinctively transform theminto a sequence that can be easily understood.It's a uniquely human achievement.We all want to share our stories,whether it is the trick we saw at the party,the bad day at the officeor the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation.Today, thanks to technology,we can share those stories as never before,by email, Facebook,blogs, tweets,on TED.com.The tools of social networking,these are the digital campfiresaround which the audience gathersto hear our story.We turn facts into similes and metaphors,and even fantasies.We polish the rough edges of our livesso that they feel whole.Our stories make us the people we areand, sometimes, the people we want to be.They give us our identityand a sense of community.And if the story is a good one,it might even make us smile.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)

I'm here to give youyour recommended dietary allowanceof poetry.And the way I'm going to do thatis present to youfive animationsof five of my poems.And let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about.Because the mixing of those two mediais a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act.But when I was United States Poet Laureate --and I love saying that.(Laughter)It's a great way to start sentences.When I was him back then,I was approached by J. Walter Thompson, the ad company,and they were hiredsort of by the Sundance Channel.And the idea was to have me record some of my poemsand then they would find animatorsto animate them.And I was initially resistant,because I always thinkpoetry can stand alone by itself.Attempts to put my poems to musichave had disastrous results,in all cases.And the poem, if it's written with the ear,already has been set to its own verbal musicas it was composed.And surely, if you're reading a poemthat mentions a cow,you don't need on the facing pagea drawing of a cow.I mean, let's let the reader do a little work.But I relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility,and also I'm like a total cartoon junkiesince childhood.I think more influentialthan Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworthon my imaginationwere Warner Brothers, Merrie Melodiesand Loony Tunes cartoons.Bugs Bunny is my muse.And this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places.And I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places --poetry on buses, poetry on subways,on billboards, on cereal boxes.When I was Poet Laureate, there I go again --I can't help it, it's true --(Laughter)I created a poetry channel on Delta Airlinesthat lasted for a couple of years.So you could tune into poetry as you were flying.And my sense is,it's a good thing to get poetry off the shelvesand more into public life.Start a meeting with a poem. That would be an idea you might take with you.When you get a poem on a billboard or on the radioor on a cereal box or whatever,it happens to you so suddenlythat you don't have timeto deploy your anti-poetry deflector shieldsthat were installed in high school.So let us start with the first one.It's a little poem called "Budapest,"and in it I reveal,or pretend to reveal,the secrets of the creative process.(Video) Narration: "Budapest."My pen moves along the pagelike the snout of a strange animalshaped like a human armand dressed in the sleeveof a loose green sweater.I watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly,intent as any foragerthat has nothing on its mindbut the grubs and insectsthat will allow it to live another day.It wants only to be here tomorrow,dressed perhapsin the sleeve of a plaid shirt,nose pressed against the page,writing a few more dutiful lineswhile I gaze out the windowand imagine Budapestor some other citywhere I have never been.BC: So that makes it seem a little easier.(Applause)Writing is not actually as easy as that for me.But I like to pretend that it comes with ease.One of my students came up after class, an introductory class,and she said, "You know, poetry is harder than writing,"which I found both erroneous and profound.(Laughter)So I like to at least pretend it just flows out.A friend of mine has a slogan; he's another poet.He says that, "If at first you don't succeed,hide all evidence you ever tried."(Laughter)The next poem is also rather short.Poetry just says a few things in different ways.And I think you could boil this poem down to saying,"Some days you eat the bear, other days the bear eats you."And it uses the imageryof dollhouse furniture.(Video) Narration: "Some Days."Some daysI put the people in their places at the table,bend their legs at the knees,if they come with that feature,and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs.All afternoon they face one another,the man in the brown suit,the woman in the blue dress --perfectly motionless, perfectly behaved.But other days I am the onewho is lifted up by the ribsthen lowered into the dining room of a dollhouseto sit with the others at the long table.Very funny.But how would you like itif you never knew from one day to the nextif you were going to spend itstriding around like a vivid god,your shoulders in the clouds,or sitting down thereamidst the wallpaperstaring straight aheadwith your little plastic face?(Applause)BC: There's a horror movie in there somewhere.The next poem is called forgetfulness,and it's really just a kind of poetic essayon the subject of mental slippage.And the poem beginswith a certain species of forgetfulnessthat someone calledliterary amnesia,in other words, forgetting the things that you have read.(Video) Narration: "Forgetfulness."The name of the author is the first to go,followed obedientlyby the title, the plot,the heartbreaking conclusion,the entire novel,which suddenly becomes one you have never read,never even heard of.It is as if, one by one,the memories you used to harbordecided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brainto a little fishing villagewhere there are no phones.Long ago,you kissed the names of the nine muses good-byeand you watched the quadratic equationpack its bag.And even now,as you memorize the order of the planets,something else is slipping away,a state flower perhaps,the address of an uncle,the capital of Paraguay.Whatever it isyou are struggling to remember,it is not poised on the tip of your tongue,not even lurkingin some obscure cornerof your spleen.It has floated awaydown a dark mythological riverwhose name begins with an Las far as you can recall,well on your own way to oblivionwhere you will join thosewho have forgotten even how to swimand how to ride a bicycle.No wonder you rise in the middle of the nightto look up the date of a famous battlein a book on war.No wonder the Moon in the windowseems to have drifted out of a love poemthat you used to know by heart.(Applause)BC: The next poem is called "The Country"and it's based on,when I was in collegeI met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine.He lived, and still does, in rural Vermont.I lived in New York City.And we would visit each other.And when I would go up to the country,he would teach me things like deer hunting,which meant getting lost with a gun basically --(Laughter)and trout fishing and stuff like that.And then he'd come down to New York Cityand I'd teach him what I knew,which was largely smoking and drinking.(Laughter)And in that way we traded lore with each other.The poem that's coming upis based on him trying to tell me a little somethingabout a domestic point of etiquettein country livingthat I had a very hard time, at first, processing.It's called "The Country."(Video) Narration: "The Country."I wondered about youwhen you told me never to leavea box of wooden strike-anywhere matchesjust lying around the house,because the mice might get into themand start a fire.But your face was absolutely straightwhen you twisted the lid downon the round tinwhere the matches, you said, are always stowed.Who could sleep that night?Who could whisk away the thoughtof the one unlikely mousepadding along a cold water pipebehind the floral wallpaper,gripping a single wooden matchbetween the needles of his teeth?Who could not see him rounding a corner,the blue tip scratching against rough-hewn beam,the sudden flareand the creature, for one bright, shining moment,suddenly thrust ahead of his time --now a fire-starter,now a torch-bearerin a forgotten ritual,little brown druidilluminating some ancient night?And who could fail to notice,lit up in the blazing insulation,the tiny looks of wondermenton the faces of his fellow mice --one-time inhabitantsof what once was your house in the country?(Applause)BC: Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. And the last poem is called "The Dead."I wrote this after a friend's funeral,but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying,as all eulogists tend to do,which is how happy the deceased would beto look down and see all of us assembled.And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife,having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified.So the little poem is called "The Dead."(Video) Narration: "The Dead."The dead are always looking down on us,they say.While we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich,they are looking downthrough the glass-bottom boats of heavenas they row themselves slowlythrough eternity.They watch the tops of our headsmoving below on Earth.And when we lie downin a field or on a couch,drugged perhapsby the hum of a warm afternoon,they think we are looking back at them,which makes them lift their oarsand fall silentand wait like parentsfor us to close our eyes.(Applause)BC: I'm not sure if other poems will be animated.It took a long time --I mean, it's rather uncommon to have this marriage --a long time to put those two together.But then again, it took us a long timeto put the wheel and the suitcase together.(Laughter)I mean, we had the wheel for some time.And schlepping is an ancient and honorable art.(Laughter)I just have timeto read a more recent poem to you.If it has a subject,the subject is adolescence.And it's addressed to a certain person.It's called "To My Favorite 17-Year-Old High School Girl.""Do you realize that if you had started building the Parthenonon the day you were born,you would be all done in only one more year?Of course, you couldn't have done that all alone.So never mind;you're fine just being yourself.You're loved for just being you.But did you know that at your ageJudy Garland was pulling down 150,000 dollars a picture,Joan of Arc was leading the French army to victoryand Blaise Pascal had cleaned up his room --no wait, I mean he had invented the calculator?Of course, there will be time for all thatlater in your life,after you come out of your roomand begin to blossom,or at least pick up all your socks.For some reason I keep rememberingthat Lady Jane Grey was queen of Englandwhen she was only 15.But then she was beheaded, so never mind her as a role model.(Laughter)A few centuries later,when he was your age,Franz Schubert was doing the dishes for his family,but that did not keep himfrom composing two symphonies, four operasand two complete masses as a youngster.(Laughter)But of course, that was in Austriaat the height of Romantic lyricism,not here in the suburbs of Cleveland.(Laughter)Frankly, who caresif Annie Oakley was a crack shot at 15or if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at 17?We think you're special just being you --playing with your food and staring into space.(Laughter)By the way,I lied about Schubert doing the dishes,but that doesn't mean he never helped out around the house."(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)Thanks.(Applause)

The recent debate over copyright lawslike SOPA in the United Statesand the ACTA agreement in Europehas been very emotional.And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoningcould really bring a great deal to the debate.I'd therefore like to proposethat we employ, we enlist,the cutting edge field of copyright mathwhenever we approach this subject.For instance, just recentlythe Motion Picture Association revealedthat our economy loses 58 billion dollars a yearto copyright theft.Now rather than just argue about this number,a copyright mathematician will analyze itand he'll soon discover that this moneycould stretch from this auditoriumall the way across Ocean Boulevardto the Westin, and then to Mars ...(Laughter)... if we use pennies.Now this is obviously a powerful,some might say dangerously powerful, insight.But it's also a morally important one.Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail valueof some pirated movies that we're talking about,but this is actual economic losses.This is the equivalentto the entire American corn crop failingalong with all of our fruit crops,as well as wheat, tobacco,rice, sorghum --whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum.But identifying the actual losses to the economyis almost impossible to dounless we use copyright math.Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a yearsince Napster first came on the scene.So that's a chunk of what we're looking for.But total movie revenuesacross theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up.And TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up.Other content markets like book publishing and radioare also up.So this small missing chunk hereis puzzling.(Laughter)(Applause)Since the big content marketshave grown in line with historic norms,it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented,but copyright math tells usit must therefore be foregone growthin a market that has no historic norms --one that didn't exist in the 90's.What we're looking at hereis the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.(Laughter)50 billion dollars of it a year,which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone,that could stretch from hereto Neanderthal times.(Laughter)It's true.(Applause)I have Excel.(Laughter)The movie folks also tell usthat our economy losesover 370,000 jobs to content theft,which is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98,the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicatedthat the motion picture and video industrieswere employing 270,000 people.Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people.And so the job losses that came with the Internetand all that content theft,have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries.And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statisticsthat copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day.And some people think that string theory is tough.(Laughter)Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit.It's the precise amount of harmthat comes to media companieswhenever a single copyrighted song or moviegets pirated.Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematicallyback when they last sat down to improve copyright damagesand made this law.Some people think this number's a little bit large,but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby expertsare merely surprisedthat it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year.Now when this law first passed,the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs.And it was a big Christmas hit.Because what little hoodlum wouldn't wanta million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket.(Laughter)(Applause)These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs,which is to say eight billion dollars-worthof stolen media.(Applause)Or about 75,000 jobs.(Laughter)(Applause)Now you might find copyright math strange,but that's because it's a fieldthat's best left to experts.So that's it for now.I hope you'll join me next timewhen I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiryinto the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy.Thank you very much.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)

A tourist is backpackingthrough the highlands of Scotland,and he stops at a pub to get a drink.And the only people in there is a bartenderand an old man nursing a beer.And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes,"You see this bar?I built this bar with my bare handsfrom the finest wood in the county.Gave it more love and care than my own child.But do they call me MacGregor the bar builder? No."Points out the window."You see that stone wall out there?I built that stone wall with my bare hands.Found every stone, placed them just so through the rain and the cold.But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No."Points out the window."You see that pier on the lake out there?I built that pier with my bare hands.Drove the pilings against the tide of the sand, plank by plank.But do they call me MacGregor the pier builder? No.But you fuck one goat ... "(Laughter)Storytelling --(Laughter)is joke telling.It's knowing your punchline,your ending,knowing that everything you're saying, from the first sentence to the last,is leading to a singular goal,and ideally confirming some truththat deepens our understandingsof who we are as human beings.We all love stories.We're born for them.Stories affirm who we are.We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning.And nothing does a greater affirmationthan when we connect through stories.It can cross the barriers of time,past, present and future,and allow us to experiencethe similarities between ourselvesand through others, real and imagined.The children's television host Mr. Rogersalways carried in his walleta quote from a social workerthat said, "Frankly, there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to loveonce you've heard their story."And the way I like to interpret thatis probably the greatest story commandment,which is "Make me care" --please, emotionally,intellectually, aesthetically,just make me care.We all know what it's like to not care.You've gone through hundreds of TV channels,just switching channel after channel,and then suddenly you actually stop on one.It's already halfway over,but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care.That's not by chance,that's by design.So it got me thinking, what if I told you my history was story,how I was born for it,how I learned along the way this subject matter?And to make it more interesting,we'll start from the endingand we'll go to the beginning.And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story,it would go something like this:And that's what ultimately led meto speaking to you here at TEDabout story.And the most current story lesson that I've hadwas completing the film I've just donethis year in 2012.The film is "John Carter." It's based on a book called "The Princess of Mars,"which was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himselfas a character inside this movie, and as the narrator.And he's summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansionwith a telegram saying, "See me at once."But once he gets there,he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed awayand been entombed in a mausoleum on the property.(Video) Butler: You won't find a keyhole.Thing only opens from the inside.He insisted,no embalming, no open coffin,no funeral.You don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commandedby being like the rest of us, huh?Come, let's go inside.AS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book,is it's fundamentally making a promise.It's making a promise to youthat this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.And that's what all good stories should do at the beginning, is they should give you a promise.You could do it an infinite amount of ways.Sometimes it's as simple as "Once upon a time ... "These Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it.And I always thought it was such a fantastic device.It's like a guy inviting you around the campfire,or somebody in a bar saying, "Here, let me tell you a story.It didn't happen to me, it happened to somebody else,but it's going to be worth your time."A well told promiseis like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshotand propels you forward through the storyto the end.In 2008,I pushed all the theories that I had on story at the timeto the limits of my understanding on this project.(Video) (Mechanical Sounds)♫ And that is all ♫♫ that love's about ♫♫ And we'll recall ♫♫ when time runs out ♫♫ That it only ♫(Laughter)AS: Storytelling without dialogue.It's the purest form of cinematic storytelling.It's the most inclusive approach you can take.It confirmed something I really had a hunch on,is that the audienceactually wants to work for their meal.They just don't want to know that they're doing that.That's your job as a storyteller,is to hide the factthat you're making them work for their meal.We're born problem solvers.We're compelled to deduceand to deduct,because that's what we do in real life.It's this well-organized absence of informationthat draws us in.There's a reason that we're all attracted to an infant or a puppy.It's not just that they're damn cute;it's because they can't completely expresswhat they're thinking and what their intentions are.And it's like a magnet.We can't stop ourselvesfrom wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in.I first startedreally understanding this storytelling devicewhen I was writing with Bob Peterson on "Finding Nemo."And we would call this the unifying theory of two plus two.Make the audience put things together.Don't give them four,give them two plus two.The elements you provide and the order you place them inis crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience.Editors and screenwriters have known this all along.It's the invisible applicationthat holds our attention to story.I don't mean to make it soundlike this is an actual exact science, it's not.That's what's so special about stories,they're not a widget, they aren't exact.Stories are inevitable, if they're good,but they're not predictable.I took a seminar in this yearwith an acting teacher named Judith Weston.And I learned a key insight to character.She believed that all well-drawn charactershave a spine.And the idea is that the character has an inner motor,a dominant, unconscious goal that they're striving for,an itch that they can't scratch.She gave a wonderful example of Michael Corleone,Al Pacino's character in "The Godfather,"and that probably his spinewas to please his father.And it's something that always drove all his choices.Even after his father died,he was still trying to scratch that itch.I took to this like a duck to water.Wall-E's was to find the beauty.Marlin's, the father in "Finding Nemo,"was to prevent harm.And Woody's was to do what was best for his child.And these spines don't always drive you to make the best choices.Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them.I'm really blessed to be a parent,and watching my children grow, I really firmly believethat you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way,and you don't have any say about it,and there's no changing it.All you can do is learn to recognize itand own it.And some of us are born with temperaments that are positive,some are negative.But a major threshold is passedwhen you mature enoughto acknowledge what drives youand to take the wheel and steer it.As parents, you're always learning who your children are.They're learning who they are.And you're still learning who you are.So we're all learning all the time.And that's why change is fundamental in story.If things go static, stories die,because life is never static.In 1998,I had finished writing "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life"and I was completely hooked on screenwriting.So I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could.So I researched everything I possibly could.And I finally came across this fantastic quoteby a British playwright, William Archer:"Drama is anticipationmingled with uncertainty."It's an incredibly insightful definition.When you're telling a story,have you constructed anticipation?In the short-term, have you made me want to knowwhat will happen next?But more importantly,have you made me want to knowhow it will all conclude in the long-term?Have you constructed honest conflictswith truth that creates doubtin what the outcome might be?An example would be in "Finding Nemo,"in the short tension, you were always worried,would Dory's short-term memorymake her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin.But under that was this global tensionof will we ever find Nemoin this huge, vast ocean?In our earliest days at Pixar,before we truly understood the invisible workings of story,we were simply a group of guys just going on our gut, going on our instincts.And it's interesting to seehow that led us placesthat were actually pretty good.You've got to remember that in this time of year,1993,what was considered a successful animated picturewas "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast,""Aladdin," "Lion King."So when we pitched "Toy Story" to Tom Hanks for the first time,he walked in and he said,"You don't want me to sing, do you?"And I thought that epitomized perfectlywhat everybody thought animation had to be at the time.But we really wanted to provethat you could tell stories completely different in animation.We didn't have any influence then,so we had a little secret list of rulesthat we kept to ourselves.And they were: No songs,no "I want" moment,no happy village,no love story.And the irony is that, in the first year,our story was not working at alland Disney was panicking.So they privately got advicefrom a famous lyricist, who I won't name,and he faxed them some suggestions.And we got a hold of that fax.And the fax said,there should be songs,there should be an "I want" song,there should be a happy village song,there should be a love storyand there should be a villain.And thank goodnesswe were just too young, rebellious and contrarian at the time.That just gave us more determinationto prove that you could build a better story.And a year after that, we did conquer it.And it just went to provethat storytelling has guidelines,not hard, fast rules.Another fundamental thing we learnedwas about liking your main character.And we had naively thought,well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end,so you've got to start from someplace.So let's make him selfish. And this is what you get.(Voice Over) Woody: What do you think you're doing?Off the bed.Hey, off the bed!Mr. Potato Head: You going to make us, Woody?Woody: No, he is.Slinky? Slink ... Slinky!Get up here and do your job.Are you deaf?I said, take care of them.Slinky: I'm sorry, Woody,but I have to agree with them.I don't think what you did was right.Woody: What? Am I hearing correctly?You don't think I was right?Who said your job was to think, Spring Wiener?AS: So how do you make a selfish character likable?We realized, you can make him kind,generous, funny, considerate,as long as one condition is met for him,is that he stays the top toy.And that's what it really is,is that we all live life conditionally.We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along,as long as certain conditions are met.After that, all bets are off.And before I'd even decided to make storytelling my career,I can now see key things that happened in my youththat really sort of opened my eyesto certain things about story.In 1986, I truly understood the notionof story having a theme.And that was the year that they restored and re-released"Lawrence of Arabia."And I saw that thing seven times in one month.I couldn't get enough of it.I could just tell there was a grand design under it --in every shot, every scene, every line.Yet, on the surface it just seemedto be depicting his historical lineageof what went on.Yet, there was something more being said. What exactly was it?And it wasn't until, on one of my later viewings,that the veil was liftedand it was in a scene where he's walked across the Sinai Desertand he's reached the Suez Canal,and I suddenly got it.(Video) Boy: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!Cyclist: Who are you?Who are you?AS: That was the theme: Who are you?Here were all these seemingly disparateevents and dialoguesthat just were chronologically telling the history of him,but underneath it was a constant,a guideline, a road map.Everything Lawrence did in that moviewas an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world.A strong theme is always running througha well-told story.When I was five,I was introduced to possibly the most major ingredientthat I feel a story should have,but is rarely invoked.And this is what my mother took me to when I was five.(Video) Thumper: Come on. It's all right.Look.The water's stiff.Bambi: Yippee!Thumper: Some fun,huh, Bambi?Come on. Get up.Like this.Ha ha. No, no, no.AS: I walked out of therewide-eyed with wonder.And that's what I think the magic ingredient is,the secret sauce,is can you invoke wonder.Wonder is honest, it's completely innocent.It can't be artificially evoked.For me, there's no greater abilitythan the gift of another human being giving you that feeling --to hold them still just for a brief moment in their dayand have them surrender to wonder.When it's tapped, the affirmation of being alive,it reaches you almost to a cellular level.And when an artist does that to another artist,it's like you're compelled to pass it on.It's like a dormant commandthat suddenly is activated in you, like a call to Devil's Tower.Do unto others what's been done to you.The best stories infuse wonder.When I was four years old,I have a vivid memoryof finding two pinpoint scars on my ankleand asking my dad what they were.And he said I had a matching pair like that on my head,but I couldn't see them because of my hair.And he explained that when I was born,I was born premature,that I came out much too early,and I wasn't fully baked;I was very, very sick.And when the doctor took a look at this yellow kid with black teeth,he looked straight at my mom and said,"He's not going to live."And I was in the hospital for months.And many blood transfusions later,I lived,and that made me special.I don't know if I really believe that.I don't know if my parents really believe that,but I didn't want to prove them wrong.Whatever I ended up being good at,I would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given.(Video) (Crying)Marlin: There, there, there.It's okay, daddy's here.Daddy's got you.I promise,I will never let anything happen to you, Nemo.AS: And that's the first story lesson I ever learned.Use what you know. Draw from it.It doesn't always mean plot or fact.It means capturing a truth from your experiencing it,expressing values you personally feeldeep down in your core.And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to youhere at TEDTalk today.Thank you.(Applause)



kevin_allocca_why_videos_go_viral

Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube,and I professionally watch YouTube videos.It's true.So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viraland then why that even matters.We all want to be stars --celebrities, singers, comedians --and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.But now Web video has made itso that any of us or any of the creative things that we docan become completely famousin a part of our world's culture.Any one of you could be famous on the Internetby next Saturday.But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTubeevery minute.And of that, only a tiny percentageever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.So how does it happen?Three things:tastemakers, communities of participationand unexpectedness.All right, let's go.(Video) Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.Oh, my God!Wooo!Ohhhhh, wowwww!KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this videothat he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.(Laughter)This is a chart of what it looked likewhen it first became popular last summer.But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.He just wanted to share a rainbow.Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.(Laughter)And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.And this video had actually been postedall the way back in January.So what happened here?Jimmy Kimmel actually.Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweetthat would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmelintroduce us to new and interesting thingsand bring them to a larger audience.(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. ♫♫ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. ♫♫ Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday. ♫KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversationwithout talking about this video I hope.Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.This is a chart of what it looked like.And similar to "Double Rainbow,"it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.So what happened on this day?Well it was a Friday, this is true.And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.(Laughter)But what about this day,this one particular Friday?Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theaterwas one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakerstook a point of viewand they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.And so then this community formedof people who shared this big inside jokeand they started talking about it and doing things with it.And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.Even in the first seven days,there was one parody for every other day of the week.(Laughter)Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century,this community participationis how we become a part of the phenomenon --either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.(Music)So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animationwith looped music.It's this, just like this.It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.And if you think that that is weird,you should know that there is a three-hour version of thisthat's been viewed four million times.(Laughter)Even cats were watching this video.(Laughter)Cats were watching other cats watch this video.(Laughter)But what's important hereis the creativity that it inspiredamongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.There were remixes.(Laughter)Someone made an old timey version.(Laughter)And then it went international.(Laughter)An entire remix community sprouted upthat brought it from being just a stupid joketo something that we can all actually be a part of.Because we don't just enjoy now,we participate.And who could have predicted any of this?Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Blackor "Nyan Cat?"What scripts could you have writtenthat would have contained this in it?In a world where over two days of videoget uploaded every minute,only that which is truly unique and unexpectedcan stand out in the way that these things have.When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great videoabout a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City,I admit I wasn't very interested.(Video) Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane,but often there are obstructionsthat keep you from properly riding in the bike lane.(Laughter)KA: By being totally surprising and humorous,Casey Niestat got his funny idea and pointseen five million times.And so this approach holdsfor anything new that we do creatively.And so it all brings usto one big question ...(Video) Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?Ohhhh.(Laughter)KA: What does it mean?Tastemakers, creative participating communities,complete unexpectedness,these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culturewhere anyone has accessand the audience defines the popularity.I mean, as mentioned earlier,one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber,got his start on YouTube.No one has to green-light your idea.And we all now feel some ownershipin our own pop culture.And these are not characteristics of old media,and they're barely true of the media of today,but they will define the entertainment of the future.Thank you.(Applause)

Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers,for his storytelling,but even more, I think,for the beauty and precision of his prose.And whether it's the opening line from "One Hundred Years of Solitude"or the fantastical stream of consciousnessin "Autumn of the Patriarch,"where the words rush by,page after page of unpunctuated imagerysweeping the reader alonglike some wild rivertwisting through a primal South American jungle,reading Márquez is a visceral experience.Which struck me as particularly remarkableduring one session with the novelwhen I realized that I was being swept alongon this remarkable, vivid journeyin translation.Now I was a comparative literature major in college,which is like an English major,only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months,we got to read great literature in translationfrom around the world.And as great as these books were,you could always tellthat you were getting close to the full effect.But not so with Márquezwho once praised his translator's versionsas being better than his own,which is an astonishing compliment.So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa,had written his own book on the subject,I couldn't wait to read it.It's called apropos of the Italian adagethat I lifted from his forward,"If This Be Treason."And it's a charming read.It's highly recommended for anyone who's interestedin the translator's art.But the reason that I mention itis that early on, Rabassa offersthis elegantly simple insight:"Every act of communicationis an act of translation."Now maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time,but for me,as often as I'd encounteredthat exact difficulty on a daily basis,I had never seen the inherent challenge of communicationin so crystalline a light.Ever since I can rememberthinking consciously about such things,communication has been my central passion.Even as a child,I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in lifewas to be able to understand everythingand then to communicate it to everyone else.So no ego problems.It's funny, my wife, Daisy,whose family is littered with schizophrenics --and I mean littered with them --once said to me, "Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he's God.I don't need a husband who wants to be."(Laughter)Anyway, as I plunged through my 20sever more aware of how unobtainablethe first part of my childhood ambition was,it was that second part,being able to successfully communicate to otherswhatever knowledge I was gaining,where the futility of my quest really set in.Time after time,whenever I set out to share some great truthwith a soon-to-be grateful recipient,it had the opposite effect.Interestingly, when your opening line of communication is,"Hey, listen up,because I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you,"it's amazing how quickly you'll discoverboth ice and the firing squad.Finally, after about 10 yearsof alienating friends and strangers alike,I finally got it,a new personal truth all my own,that if I was going to ever communicate well with other peoplethe ideas that I was gaining,I'd better find a different way of going about it.And that's when I discovered comedy.Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelengthfrom other forms of language.If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum,I'd say it falls somewherebetween poetry and lies.And I'm not talking about all comedy here,because, clearly, there's plenty of humorthat colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel.What I want to talk aboutis the unique ability that the best comedy and satire hasat circumventing our ingrained perspectives --comedy as the philosopher's stone.It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdomand transforms it through ridiculeinto a different way of seeingand ultimately being in the world.Because that's what I takefrom the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation.That it's about communicationthat doesn't just produce greater understandingwithin the individual,but leads to real change.Which in my experience means communicationthat manages to speak to and expandour concept of self-interest.Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interestbecause we're all wired for that.It's part of our survival package,and that's why it's become so important for us,and that's why we're always listening at that level.And also because that's where,in terms of our own self-interest,we finally begin to graspour ability to respond, our responsibilityto the rest of the world.Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire,I mean work that comes first and foremostfrom a place of honesty and integrity.Now if you think backon Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Liveof the newly nominated vice presidential candidateSarah Palin,they were devastating.Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political punditthe candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness,cementing an impressionthat the majority of the American public still holds today.And the key detail of thisis that Fey's scripts weren't written by herand they weren't written by the SNL writers.They were lifted verbatimfrom Palin's own remarks.(Laughter)Here was a Palin impersonatorquoting Palin word for word.Now that's honesty and integrity,and it's also why Fey's performancesleft such a lasting impression.On the other side of the political spectrum,the first time that I heard Rush Limbaughrefer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girlI knew that he'd made a direct hit.Now it's not often that I'm going to associatethe words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh,but it's really hard to argue with that punchline.The description perfectly capturedEdwards' personal vanity.And guess what?That ended up being the exact personality traitthat was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career.Now The Daily Show with John Stewartis by far the most --(Applause)(Laughter)it's by far the most well-documented exampleof the effectiveness of this kind of comedy.Survey after survey,from Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy,has found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current eventsthan the viewers of all major network and cable news shows.(Applause)Now whether this says moreabout the conflict between integrity and profitabilityof corporate journalismthan it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers,the larger point remainsthat Stewart's materialis always grounded in a commitment to the facts --not because his intent is to inform. It's not.His intent is to be funny.It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funnydoesn't work unless the facts are true.And the result is great comedythat's also an information delivery systemthat scores markedly higher in both credibility and retentionthan the professional news media.Now this is doubly ironicwhen you consider that what gives comedy its edgeat reaching around people's wallsis the way that it uses deliberate misdirection.A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick,where you think it's going over hereand then all of a sudden you're transported over here.And there's this mental delightthat's followed by the physical response of laughter,which, not coincidentally,releases endorphins in the brain.And just like that, you've been seducedinto a different way of looking at somethingbecause the endorphins have brought down your defenses.This is the exact oppositeof the way that anger and fear and panic,all of the flight-or-fight responses, operate.Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin,which throws our walls up sky-high.And the comedy comes along,dealing with a lot of the same areaswhere our defenses are the strongest --race, religion, politics, sexuality --only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin,we get endorphinsand the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows,revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view.Now let me give you an example from my act.I have some materialabout the so-called radical gay agenda,which starts off by asking,how radical is the gay agenda?Because from what I can tell, the three things gay Americans seem to want mostare to join the military, get married and start a family.(Laughter)Three things I've tried to avoid my entire life.(Laughter)Have at it you radical bastards. The field is yours.(Laughter)And that's followed by these linesabout gay adoption:What is the problem with gay adoption?Why is this remotely controversial?If you have a baby and you think that baby's gay,you should be allowed to put it up for adoption.(Laughter)You have given birth to an abomination.Remove it from your household.Now by taking the biblical epithet "abomination"and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence, a baby,this joke short circuits the emotional wiringbehind the debateand it leaves the audience with the opportunity, through their laughter,to question its validity.Misdirection isn't the only trickthat comedy has up its sleeve.Economy of languageis another real strong suit of great comedy.There are few phrasesthat pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbolthan the perfect punchline.Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work,you should really Google him --Hicks had a routineabout getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground,where finally the other kid says to him,"Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad,"to which Hicks replies,"Really? How soon?"(Laughter)That's an entire childhoodin three words.(Laughter)Not to mention what it revealsabout the adult who's speaking them.And one last powerful attributethat comedy has as communicationis that it's inherently viral.People can't waitto pass along that new great joke.And this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world.Comedy has been crossing countrywith remarkable speedway before the Internet, social media,even cable TV.Back in 1980when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fireduring a freebasing accident,I was in Los Angeles the day after it happenedand then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that.And I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts --something about the Ignited Negro College Fund.Clearly, it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue.And my guess here -- and I have no research on this --is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it,you'd find out that comedyis the second oldest viral profession.First there were drumsand then knock-knock jokes.(Laughter)But it's when you put all of these elements together --when you get the viral appeal of a great jokewith a powerful punchlinethat's crafted from honesty and integrity,it can have a real world impactat changing a conversation.Now I have a close friend, Joel Pett,who's the editorial cartoonistfor the Lexington Herald-Leader.And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy.I was visiting with Joelthe weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change openedin December of 2009.And Joel was explaining to methat, because USA Todaywas one of America's four papers of record,it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference,which meant that, if he hit it out of the park with his cartoonon Monday, the opening day of the conference,it could get passed aroundat the highest level among actual decision-makers.So we started talking about climate change.And it turned out that Joel and Iwere both bothered by the same thing,which was how so much of the debatewas still focused on the scienceand how complete it was or wasn't,which, to both of us,seems somewhat intentionally off point.Because first of all, there's this false premisethat such a thing as complete science exists.Now Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texaswas pushing this same line this past summerat the beginning of his oops-fated campaignfor the Republican presidential nomination,proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't completeat the same time that 250out of 254 counties in the state of Texaswere on fire.And Perry's policy solutionwas to ask the people of Texasto pray for rain.Personally, I was praying for four more firesso we could finally complete the damn science.(Laughter)But back in 2009,the question Joel and I kept turning over and overwas why this late in the gameso much energy was being spent talking about the sciencewhen the policies necessary to address climate changewere unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long runregardless of the science.So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this.Cartoon: "What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?"(Laughter)You've got to love that idea.(Applause)How about that? How about we create a better world for nothing?Not for God, not for country, not for profit --just as a basic metric for global decision-making.And this cartoon hit the bull's eye.Shortly after the conference was over,Joel got a request for a signed copyfrom the head of the EPA in Washingtonwhose wall it now hangs on.And not long after that, he got another request for a copyfrom the head of the EPA in Californiawho used it as part of her presentationat an international conference on climate changein Sacramento last year.And it didn't stop there.To date, Joel's gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups,in the United States, Canada and Europe.And earlier this year,he got a request from the Green Party in Australiawho used it in their campaignwhere it became part of the debatethat resulted in the Australian parliamentadopting the most rigorous carbon tax regimeof any country in the world.(Applause)That is a lot of punchfor 14 words.So my suggestion to those of you out herewho are seriously focused on creating a better worldis to take a little bit of time each dayand practice thinking funny,because you might just find the question that you've been looking for.Thank you.(Applause)

I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.I grew up in Mobile, Alabama --somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? --and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers,forming this beautiful delta.And the delta has alligators crawlingin and out of rivers filled with fishand cypress trees dripping with snakes,birds of every flavor.It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in --if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.And I remember my first real contact with octopuswas probably at age five or six.I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.And I reached down and picked him up, and immediatelybecame fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my handsand started flashing colors,just pulsing all of these colors.And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,raised into a spherical shapeand turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him,so I put him down.The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing:It landed on the bottom in the rubbleand -- fwoosh! -- vanishedright before my eyes.And I knew, right then, at age six,that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate schoolat the University of Hawaii.And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanksbut not a lot of invertebrate displays,and being the spineless guy, I thought, wellI'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animalsI had been learning about as a studentand bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at,but they didn't really interact with people.But the octopus did.If you walked up to an octopus tank,especially early in the morning before anyone arrived,the octopus would rise up and look at youand you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realizethat these animals all have different personalities:Some of them would hold their ground,others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,and one in particular, this amazing animal ...I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,and he had little horns come up above his eyes.So I went right up to the front of the tank --I was three or four inches from the front glass --and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock,and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away,and at that time I could actually focus that close;now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.Anyway, there we were, staring at each other,and he reaches down and grabs an armful of graveland releases it in the jet of water entering the tankfrom the filtration system,and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it --chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing.Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.And then I realize the octopus won the arms race,because I was out and he had six left. (Laughter)But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that daywas that this octopus was playing,which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.So, about three years into my degree,a funny thing happened on the way to the office,which actually changed the course of my life.A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentiallyhe sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacificto collect animals for him,and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.He said, "Make a movie about this expedition.""OK, a couple of biologists making a movie --this'll be interesting,"and off we went. And we did, we made a movie,which had to be the worst movie ever madein the history of movie making,but it was a blast. I had so much fun.And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head,thinking, "Wait a minute.Maybe I can do this all the time.Yeah, I'll be a filmmaker."So I literally came back from that job,quit school, hung my filmmaking shingleand just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.It's been a good ride.And what I learned in school though was really beneficial.If you're a wildlife filmmakerand you're going out into the field to film animals,especially behavior,it helps to have a fundamental backgroundon who these animals are,how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.But where I really learned about octopuswas in the field, as a filmmakermaking films with them,where you're allowed to spend large periods of timewith the animals, seeing octopus being octopusin their ocean homes.I remember I took a trip to Australia,went to an island called One Tree Island.And apparently, evolution had occurredat a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,between the time they named it and the time I arrived,because I'm sure there were at least three treeson that island when we were there.Anyway, one tree is situated right next toa beautiful coral reef.In fact, there's a surge channelwhere the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.And there's a beautiful reef,very complex reef, with lots of animals,including a lot of octopus.And not uniquelybut certainly, the octopus in Australiaare masters at camouflage.As a matter of fact,there's one right there.So our first challenge was to find these things,and that was a challenge, indeed.But the idea is, we were there for a monthand I wanted to acclimate the animals to usso that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.So the first week was pretty much spentjust getting as close as we could,every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchyand you'd back up, come back in a few hours.And after the first week, they ignored us.It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."So they went on about their businessand from a foot away, we're watching matingand courting and fightingand it is just an unbelievable experience.And one of the most fantastic displaysthat I remember, or at least visually,was a foraging behavior.And they had a lot of different techniquesthat they would use for foraging,but this particular one used vision.And they would see a coral head,maybe 10 feet away,and start moving over toward that coral head.And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottomand go through the water and land right on top of this coral head,and then the web between the armswould completely engulf the coral head,and they would fish out, swim for crabs.And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.And I always wondered what happened under that web.So we created a way to find out, (Laughter)and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.It was fantastic.If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals,you might as well pick one that's fairly common.And octopus are, they live in all the oceans.They also live deep.And I can't say octopus are responsiblefor my really strong interestin getting in subs and going deep,but whatever the case, I like that.It's like nothing you've ever done.If you ever really want to get away from it alland see something that you have never seen,and have an excellent chance of seeing somethingno one has ever seen, get in a sub.You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen,turn on the scrubber,which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.Down you go. There's no connection to the surfaceapart from a pretty funky radio.And as you go down, the washing machineat the surface calms down.And it gets quiet.And it starts getting really nice.And as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched ingives way to darker and darker blue.And finally, it's a rich lavender,and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.And now you've entered the realmof the mid-water community.You could give an entire talkabout the creatures that live in the mid-water.Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned,without question, the most bizarre designsand outrageous behaviorsare in the animals that live in the mid-water community.But we're just going to zip right past this area,this area that includes about 95 percentof the living space on our planetand go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range,40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall,some of which are tens of thousands of feetand bust through the surface,creating islands like Hawaii.And the top of this mountain rangeis splitting apart, creating a rift valley.And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action isbecause literally thousands of active volcanoesare going off at any point in timeall along this 40,000 mile range.And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart,magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,and you're looking land -- new land --being created right before your eyes.And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of watercreating enormous pressure,forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth,until it hits a magma chamberwhere it becomes superheatedand supersaturated with minerals,reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surfaceand is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.In fact, this whole areais like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.So it immediately cools,and it can no longer hold in suspensionall of the material that it's dissolved,and it precipitates out, forming black smoke.And it forms these towers, these chimneysthat are 10, 20, 30 feet tall.And all along the sides of these chimneysis shimmering with heat and loaded with life.You've got black smokers going all over the placeand chimneys that have tube wormsthat might be eight to 10 feet long.And out of the tops of these tube wormsare these beautiful red plumes.And living amongst the tangle of tube wormsis an entire community of animals:shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab,clams and swarms of arthropodsthat are playing that dangerous gamebetween over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.And this whole ecosystemwasn't even known aboutuntil 33 years ago.And it completely threw science on its head.It made scientists rethinkwhere life on Earth might have actually begun.And before the discovery of these vents,all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth,was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis.But down there, there is no sun,there is no photosynthesis;it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it,and it's all so ephemeral.You might film thisunbelievable hydrothermal vent,which you think at the time has to be on another planet.It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;it looks like aliens in an alien environment.But you go back to the same vent eight years laterand it can be completely dead.There's no hot water.All of the animals are gone, they're dead,and the chimneys are still therecreating a really nice ghost town,an eerie, spooky ghost town,but essentially devoid of animals, of course.But 10 miles down the ridge...pshhh! There's another volcano going.And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communitiesis going on every 30 or 40 yearsall along the ridge.And that ephemeral natureof the hydrothermal vent communityisn't really different from some of theareas that I've seenin 35 years of traveling around, making films.Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.And you go back, and I'm at home,and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...Ah! I know where I can shoot that.There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods."And you show up, and it's dead.There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.You think, "Well, what happened?"And you turn around,and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in,and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.And over herethere's a golf course going in.And this is the tropics.It's raining like crazy here.So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside,carrying with it sediments from the construction site,smothering the coral and killing it.And fertilizers and pesticidesare flowing into the bay from the golf course --the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals,fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom --and there's your pea soup.But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite.I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck,"and go and work on the other side of the island.Five years later, come back,and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.It's got living coral, fish all over the place,crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"Well, how it happened isthe local community galvanized.They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it;enacted laws and made permits requiredto do responsible constructionand golf course maintenanceand stopped the sediments flowing into the bay,and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay,and the bay recovered.The ocean has an amazing abilityto recover, if we'll just leave it alone.I think Margaret Meadsaid it best.She said that a small group of thoughtful peoplecould change the world.Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.And a small group of thoughtful peoplechanged that bay.I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.I've been to a lot of lectureswhere, at the end of it, inevitably,one of the first questions that comes up is,"But, but what can I do?I'm an individual. I'm one person.And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming."Fair enough question.My answer to that is don't lookat the big, overwhelming issues of the world.Look in your own backyard.Look in your heart, actually.What do you really care about that isn't right where you live?And fix it.Create a healing zone in your neighborhoodand encourage others to do the same.And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map,little dots on a map.And in fact, the way that we can communicate today --where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China,and the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ...and everybody is talking to everyone else --it's not isolated points on a map anymore,it's a network we've created.And maybe these healing zones can start growing,and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.So that's how I answer that question.Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.What can you do that is more responsiblethan what you're doing now?And do that, and spread the word.The vent community animalscan't really do muchabout the life and deaththat's going on where they live, but up here we can.In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.And we can make changes to our behaviorthat will influence and affect the environment,like those people changed the health of that bay.Now, Sylvia's TED Prize wishwas to beseech us to do anything we could,everything we could,to set aside not pin pricks,but significant expansesof the ocean for preservation,"hope spots," she calls them.And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.And it's my hope that some of these "hope spots"can be in the deep ocean,an area that has historicallybeen seriously neglected, if not abused.The term "deep six" comes to mind:"If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill,deep six it!"So, I hope that we can also keepsome of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.Now, I don't get a wish,but I certainly can saythat I will do anything I canto support Sylvia Earle's wish.And that I do.Thank you very much. (Applause)

I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.I grew up in Mobile, Alabama --somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? --and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers,forming this beautiful delta.And the delta has alligators crawlingin and out of rivers filled with fishand cypress trees dripping with snakes,birds of every flavor.It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in --if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.And I remember my first real contact with octopuswas probably at age five or six.I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.And I reached down and picked him up, and immediatelybecame fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my handsand started flashing colors,just pulsing all of these colors.And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,raised into a spherical shapeand turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him,so I put him down.The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing:It landed on the bottom in the rubbleand -- fwoosh! -- vanishedright before my eyes.And I knew, right then, at age six,that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate schoolat the University of Hawaii.And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanksbut not a lot of invertebrate displays,and being the spineless guy, I thought, wellI'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animalsI had been learning about as a studentand bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at,but they didn't really interact with people.But the octopus did.If you walked up to an octopus tank,especially early in the morning before anyone arrived,the octopus would rise up and look at youand you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realizethat these animals all have different personalities:Some of them would hold their ground,others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,and one in particular, this amazing animal ...I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,and he had little horns come up above his eyes.So I went right up to the front of the tank --I was three or four inches from the front glass --and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock,and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away,and at that time I could actually focus that close;now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.Anyway, there we were, staring at each other,and he reaches down and grabs an armful of graveland releases it in the jet of water entering the tankfrom the filtration system,and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it --chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing.Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.And then I realize the octopus won the arms race,because I was out and he had six left. (Laughter)But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that daywas that this octopus was playing,which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.So, about three years into my degree,a funny thing happened on the way to the office,which actually changed the course of my life.A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentiallyhe sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacificto collect animals for him,and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.He said, "Make a movie about this expedition.""OK, a couple of biologists making a movie --this'll be interesting,"and off we went. And we did, we made a movie,which had to be the worst movie ever madein the history of movie making,but it was a blast. I had so much fun.And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head,thinking, "Wait a minute.Maybe I can do this all the time.Yeah, I'll be a filmmaker."So I literally came back from that job,quit school, hung my filmmaking shingleand just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.It's been a good ride.And what I learned in school though was really beneficial.If you're a wildlife filmmakerand you're going out into the field to film animals,especially behavior,it helps to have a fundamental backgroundon who these animals are,how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.But where I really learned about octopuswas in the field, as a filmmakermaking films with them,where you're allowed to spend large periods of timewith the animals, seeing octopus being octopusin their ocean homes.I remember I took a trip to Australia,went to an island called One Tree Island.And apparently, evolution had occurredat a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,between the time they named it and the time I arrived,because I'm sure there were at least three treeson that island when we were there.Anyway, one tree is situated right next toa beautiful coral reef.In fact, there's a surge channelwhere the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.And there's a beautiful reef,very complex reef, with lots of animals,including a lot of octopus.And not uniquelybut certainly, the octopus in Australiaare masters at camouflage.As a matter of fact,there's one right there.So our first challenge was to find these things,and that was a challenge, indeed.But the idea is, we were there for a monthand I wanted to acclimate the animals to usso that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.So the first week was pretty much spentjust getting as close as we could,every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchyand you'd back up, come back in a few hours.And after the first week, they ignored us.It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."So they went on about their businessand from a foot away, we're watching matingand courting and fightingand it is just an unbelievable experience.And one of the most fantastic displaysthat I remember, or at least visually,was a foraging behavior.And they had a lot of different techniquesthat they would use for foraging,but this particular one used vision.And they would see a coral head,maybe 10 feet away,and start moving over toward that coral head.And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottomand go through the water and land right on top of this coral head,and then the web between the armswould completely engulf the coral head,and they would fish out, swim for crabs.And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.And I always wondered what happened under that web.So we created a way to find out, (Laughter)and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.It was fantastic.If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals,you might as well pick one that's fairly common.And octopus are, they live in all the oceans.They also live deep.And I can't say octopus are responsiblefor my really strong interestin getting in subs and going deep,but whatever the case, I like that.It's like nothing you've ever done.If you ever really want to get away from it alland see something that you have never seen,and have an excellent chance of seeing somethingno one has ever seen, get in a sub.You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen,turn on the scrubber,which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.Down you go. There's no connection to the surfaceapart from a pretty funky radio.And as you go down, the washing machineat the surface calms down.And it gets quiet.And it starts getting really nice.And as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched ingives way to darker and darker blue.And finally, it's a rich lavender,and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.And now you've entered the realmof the mid-water community.You could give an entire talkabout the creatures that live in the mid-water.Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned,without question, the most bizarre designsand outrageous behaviorsare in the animals that live in the mid-water community.But we're just going to zip right past this area,this area that includes about 95 percentof the living space on our planetand go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range,40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall,some of which are tens of thousands of feetand bust through the surface,creating islands like Hawaii.And the top of this mountain rangeis splitting apart, creating a rift valley.And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action isbecause literally thousands of active volcanoesare going off at any point in timeall along this 40,000 mile range.And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart,magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,and you're looking land -- new land --being created right before your eyes.And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of watercreating enormous pressure,forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth,until it hits a magma chamberwhere it becomes superheatedand supersaturated with minerals,reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surfaceand is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.In fact, this whole areais like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.So it immediately cools,and it can no longer hold in suspensionall of the material that it's dissolved,and it precipitates out, forming black smoke.And it forms these towers, these chimneysthat are 10, 20, 30 feet tall.And all along the sides of these chimneysis shimmering with heat and loaded with life.You've got black smokers going all over the placeand chimneys that have tube wormsthat might be eight to 10 feet long.And out of the tops of these tube wormsare these beautiful red plumes.And living amongst the tangle of tube wormsis an entire community of animals:shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab,clams and swarms of arthropodsthat are playing that dangerous gamebetween over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.And this whole ecosystemwasn't even known aboutuntil 33 years ago.And it completely threw science on its head.It made scientists rethinkwhere life on Earth might have actually begun.And before the discovery of these vents,all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth,was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis.But down there, there is no sun,there is no photosynthesis;it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it,and it's all so ephemeral.You might film thisunbelievable hydrothermal vent,which you think at the time has to be on another planet.It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;it looks like aliens in an alien environment.But you go back to the same vent eight years laterand it can be completely dead.There's no hot water.All of the animals are gone, they're dead,and the chimneys are still therecreating a really nice ghost town,an eerie, spooky ghost town,but essentially devoid of animals, of course.But 10 miles down the ridge...pshhh! There's another volcano going.And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communitiesis going on every 30 or 40 yearsall along the ridge.And that ephemeral natureof the hydrothermal vent communityisn't really different from some of theareas that I've seenin 35 years of traveling around, making films.Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.And you go back, and I'm at home,and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...Ah! I know where I can shoot that.There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods."And you show up, and it's dead.There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.You think, "Well, what happened?"And you turn around,and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in,and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.And over herethere's a golf course going in.And this is the tropics.It's raining like crazy here.So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside,carrying with it sediments from the construction site,smothering the coral and killing it.And fertilizers and pesticidesare flowing into the bay from the golf course --the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals,fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom --and there's your pea soup.But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite.I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck,"and go and work on the other side of the island.Five years later, come back,and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.It's got living coral, fish all over the place,crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"Well, how it happened isthe local community galvanized.They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it;enacted laws and made permits requiredto do responsible constructionand golf course maintenanceand stopped the sediments flowing into the bay,and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay,and the bay recovered.The ocean has an amazing abilityto recover, if we'll just leave it alone.I think Margaret Meadsaid it best.She said that a small group of thoughtful peoplecould change the world.Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.And a small group of thoughtful peoplechanged that bay.I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.I've been to a lot of lectureswhere, at the end of it, inevitably,one of the first questions that comes up is,"But, but what can I do?I'm an individual. I'm one person.And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming."Fair enough question.My answer to that is don't lookat the big, overwhelming issues of the world.Look in your own backyard.Look in your heart, actually.What do you really care about that isn't right where you live?And fix it.Create a healing zone in your neighborhoodand encourage others to do the same.And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map,little dots on a map.And in fact, the way that we can communicate today --where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China,and the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ...and everybody is talking to everyone else --it's not isolated points on a map anymore,it's a network we've created.And maybe these healing zones can start growing,and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.So that's how I answer that question.Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.What can you do that is more responsiblethan what you're doing now?And do that, and spread the word.The vent community animalscan't really do muchabout the life and deaththat's going on where they live, but up here we can.In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.And we can make changes to our behaviorthat will influence and affect the environment,like those people changed the health of that bay.Now, Sylvia's TED Prize wishwas to beseech us to do anything we could,everything we could,to set aside not pin pricks,but significant expansesof the ocean for preservation,"hope spots," she calls them.And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.And it's my hope that some of these "hope spots"can be in the deep ocean,an area that has historicallybeen seriously neglected, if not abused.The term "deep six" comes to mind:"If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill,deep six it!"So, I hope that we can also keepsome of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.Now, I don't get a wish,but I certainly can saythat I will do anything I canto support Sylvia Earle's wish.And that I do.Thank you very much.

I've spent the last decadesubjecting myself to pain and humiliation,hopefully for a good cause,which is self-improvement.And I've done this in three parts.So first I started with the mind.And I decided to try to get smarterby reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannicafrom A to Z --or, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec."And here's a little image of that.And this was an amazing year.It was really a fascinating journey.It was painful at times,especially for those around me.My wife started to fine me one dollarfor every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.So it had its downsides.But after that,I decided to work on the spirit.As I mentioned last year,I grew up with no religion at all.I'm Jewish,but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.(Laughter)Not really.But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritageby actually diving inand trying to live it and immerse myself in it.So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.And from the Ten Commandmentsto growing my beard --because Leviticus says you cannot shave.So this is what I looked like by the end.Thank you for that reaction.(Laughter)I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.I got both of them.So there was the topiary there.And there's the sheep.Now the final part of the trilogywas I wanted to focus on the bodyand try to be the healthiest person I could be,the healthiest person alive.So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years.And I just finished a couple of months ago.And I have to say, thank God.Because living so healthily was killing me.(Laughter)It was so overwhelming,because the amount of things you have to do,it's just mind-boggling.I was listening to all the expertsand talking to sort of a board of medical advisers.And they were telling meall the things I had to do.I had to eat right,exercise, meditate, pet dogs,because that lowers the blood pressure.I wrote the book on a treadmill,and it took me about a thousand milesto write the book.I had to put on sunscreen.This was no small feat,because if you listen to dermatologists,they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.And you have to reapply it every two to four hours.So I think half of my book advancewent into sunscreen.I was like a glazed doughnutfor most of the year.There was the washing of hands.I had to do that properly.And my immunologist told methat I should also wipe downall of the remote controls and iPhones in my house,because those are just orgies of germs.So that took a lot of time.I also tried to be the safest person I could be,because that's a part of health.I was inspiredby the Danish Safety Council.They started a public campaignthat says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet."So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking,but also for walking around.And you can see therethey're shopping with their helmets.(Laughter)Well yeah, I tried that.Now it's a little extreme, I admit.But if you think about this,this is actually -- the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this --that more people die on a per mile basisfrom drunk walkingthan from drunk driving.So something to think about tonightif you've had a couple.So I finished,and it was a success in a sense.All of the markers went in the right direction.My cholesterol went down, I lost weight,my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.So that was nice.And it was successful overall.But I also learned that I was too healthy,and that was unhealthy.I was so focused on doing all these thingsthat I was neglecting my friends and family.And as Dan Buettner can tell you,having a strong social networkis so crucial to our health.So I finished.And I kind of went overboardon the week after the project was over.I went to the dark side,and I just indulged myself.It was like something out of Caligula.(Laughter)Without the sex part.Because I have three young kids,so that wasn't happening.But the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely.And I finally have stabilized.So now I'm backto adopting many -- not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore --but dozens of healthy behaviorsthat I adopted during my year.It was really a life-changing project.And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them.Let me just tell you two really quickly.The first is -- and this was surprising to me;I didn't expect this to come out --but I live a much quieter life now.Because we live in such a noisy world.There's trains and planes and carsand Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy.(Laughter)And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard --not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does,but it actually initiatesthe fight-or-flight response.A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going.And this, over the years,can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.The World Health Organization just did a big studythat they published this year.And it was done in Europe.And they estimatedthat 1.6 million years of healthy livingare lost every year in Europebecause of noise pollution.So they think it's actually very deadly.And by the way,it's also terrible for your brain.It really impairs cognition.And our Founding Fathers knew about this.When they wrote the Constitution,they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hallso that they could concentrate.So without noise reduction technology,our country would not exist.So as a patriot,I felt it was important to --I wear all the earplugs and the earphones,and it's really improved my lifein a surprising and unexpected way.And the second point I want to make, the final point,is that -- and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED --that joy is so important to your health,that very few of these behaviorswill stick with meunless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them.And just to give you one instance of this:food.The junk food industryis really greatat pressing our pleasure buttonsand figuring out what's the most pleasurable.But I think we can use their techniquesand apply them to healthy food.To give just one example,we love crunchiness, mouthfeel.So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchinessinto a lot of my recipes --throw in some sunflower seeds.And you can almost trick yourselfinto thinking you're eating Doritos.(Laughter)And it has made me a healthier person.So that is it.The book about it comes out in April.It's called "Drop Dead Healthy."And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.That's my greatest hope.So thank you very much.(Applause)

Okay, I have no idea what we're going to play.I won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens.I didn't realize there was going to be a little music before.So I think I'm going to start with what I just heard.(Music)(Applause)Okay, so first of all,let's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums,(Applause)Burniss Travis on the bass,(Applause)and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano.(Applause)So the bandstand, as we call it,this is an incredible space.It is really a sacred space.And one of the things that is really sacred about itis that you have no opportunity to think about the future,or the past.You really are alive right here in this moment.There are so many decisions being madewhen you walk on the bandstand.We had no idea what key we were going to play in.In the middle, we sort of made our wayinto a song called "Titi Boom."But that could have happened -- maybe, maybe not.Everyone's listening. We're responding.You have no time for projected ideas.So the idea of a mistake:From the perspective of a jazz musician,it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake.So the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand --first of all, we don't really see it as a mistake.The only mistake liesin that I'm not able to perceivewhat it is that someone else did.Every "mistake" is an opportunity in jazz.So it's hard to even describewhat a funny note would be.So for example, if I played a color, like we were playing on a palette,that sounded like this ...(Music)So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.(Music)See, these are all right inside of the color palette.If you played an E.See, these all lie right insideof this general emotional palette that we were painting.If you played an F# though,(Dissonance)to most people's ears, they would perceive that as a mistake.So I'm going to show you, we're going to play just for a second.And we're going to play on this palette.And at some point, Christian will introduce this note.And we won't react to it.He'll introduce it for a secondand then I'll stop, I'll talk for a second.We'll see what happens when we play with this palette.(Music)So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake.The only way that I would say it was a mistakeis in that we didn't react to it.It was an opportunity that was missed.So it's unpredictable. We'll paint this palette again.He'll play it. I don't know how we'll react to it, but something will change.We'll all accept his ideas,or not.(Music)So you see, he played this note.I ended up creating a melody out of it.The texture changed in the drums this time.It got a little bit more rhythmic, a little bit more intensein response to how I responded to it.So there is no mistake.The only mistake is if I'm not aware,if each individual musician is not awareand accepting enough of his fellow band memberto incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity.So jazz, this bandstand is absolutely amazing.It's a very purifying experience.And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted.We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing.So how does this all relate to behavioral finance?Well we're jazz musicians,so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance.(Laughter)Anyway, I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it.And the other dynamic of itis that we don't micromanage in jazz.You have some people who do.But what that doesis it actually limits the artistic possibilities.If I come up and I dictate to the bandthat I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way,and I just jump right in ...ready, just play some time.One, two, one, two, three, four.(Music)It's kind of chaotic because I'm bullying my ideas.I'm telling them, "You come with me over this way."If I really want the music to go there,the best way for me to do it is to listen.This is a science of listening.It has far more to do with what I can perceivethan what it is that I can do.So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity,the first step for me isto be patient, to listen to what's going onand pull from something that's going on around me.When you do that, you engage and inspire the other musiciansand they give you more, and gradually it builds.Watch. One, two, a one, two, three, four.(Music)Totally different experience when I'm pulling ideas.It's much more organic. It's much more nuanced.It's not about bullying my vision or anything like that.It's about being here in the moment,accepting one anotherand allowing creativity to flow.Thank you.(Applause)

john_bohannon_dance_vs_powerpoint_a_modest_proposal
457556

(Music)Good afternoon.As you're all aware, we face difficult economic times.I come to you with a modest proposalfor easing the financial burden.This idea came to me while talking toa physicist friend of mine at MIT.He was struggling to explain something to me:a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter.Now he confused me from the very start,because light doesn't cool things down.It makes it hotter. It's happening right now.The reason that you can see me standing here is becausethis room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons,and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light.All of them are different colors,they're rippling with different frequencies,and they're bouncing off every surface, including me,and some of those are flying directly into your eyes,and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.Now a laser is different.It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized,and if you focus them into a beam,what you have is an incredibly useful tool.The control of a laser is so precisethat you can perform surgery inside of an eye,you can use it to store massive amounts of data,and you can use it for this beautiful experimentthat my friend was struggling to explain.First you trap atoms in a special bottle.It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atomsfrom the noise of the environment.And the atoms themselves are quite violent,but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency,an atom will briefly absorb those photonsand tend to slow down.Little by little it gets colderuntil eventually it approaches absolute zero.Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough,something truly bizarre happens.It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.The atoms lose their individual identity,and the rules from the quantum world take over,and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.For example, if you shine light through a superfluid,it is able to slow photons downto 60 kilometers per hour.Another spooky property is that it flowswith absolutely no viscosity or friction,so if you were to take the lid off that bottle,it won't stay inside.A thin film will creep up the inside wall,flow over the top and right out the outside.Now of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment,and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree,it immediately turns back into normal matter.Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered.And this is the great pleasure of science:the defeat of our intuition through experimentation.But the experiment is not the end of the story,because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people.I have a Ph.D in molecular biology.I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about.So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment,it seemed like the more he said,the less I understood.Because if you're trying to give someone the big pictureof a complex idea, to really capture its essence,the fewer words you use, the better.In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all.I remember thinking, my friend could have explainedthat entire experiment with a dance.Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.Instead of explaining their research with words,scientists have to explain it with dance.Now surprisingly, it seems to work.Dance really can make science easier to understand.But don't take my word for it.Go on the Internet and search for "Dance Your Ph.D."There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contestis that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research.For example, at the University of Minnesota,there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde,and he works with dancers to study how cells move.They do it by changing their shape.When a chemical signal washes up on one side,it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side,because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment.So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions.But what seems so slow and graceful from the outsideis really more like chaos inside,because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers,and those fibers are constantly falling apart.But just as quickly as they explode,more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer,so it's constantly changingjust to remain exactly the same.Now, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab,but before he does that, he works with dancersto figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place.It's basically efficient brainstorming,and when I visited David to learn about his research,he used dancers to explain it to merather than the usual method: PowerPoint.And this brings me to my modest proposal.I think that bad PowerPoint presentationsare a serious threat to the global economy.(Laughter) (Applause)Now it does depend on how you measure it, of course,but one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day.Now that assumes half-hour presentationsfor an average audience of four peoplewith salaries of 35,000 dollars,and it conservatively assumes thatabout a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time,and given that there are some apparently30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day,that would indeed add up to an annual wasteof 100 billion dollars.Of course, that's just the time we're losingsitting through presentations.There are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool,and like any tool, it can and will be abused.To borrow a concept from my country's CIA,it helps you to soften up your audience.It distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data.It allows you to create the illusion of competence,the illusion of simplicity,and most destructively, the illusion of understanding.So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt.Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money.One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts.For example, our National Endowment for the Arts,with its $150 million budget,slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debtby about one one-thousandth of a percent.One certainly can't argue with those numbers.However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts,there will be some drawbacks.The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed.Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution,and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods.All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts,which I hope will not be liable to the least objection.Once we eliminate public funding for the artists,let's put them back to workby using them instead of PowerPoint.As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers.After all, they are the most perishable of their kind,prone to injury and very slow to healdue to our health care system.Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds,we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems.Imagine our politicians using danceto explain why we must invade a foreign countryor bail out an investment bank.It's sure to help.Of course someday, in the deep future,a technology of persuasioneven more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented,rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric.However, I trust that by that day,we shall have passed this present financial calamity.Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxuryof just sitting in an audiencewith no other purposethan to witness the human form in motion.(Music)(Applause)

If your life were a bookand you were the author,how would you want your story to go?Growing up in the hot Last Vegas desert,all I wanted was to be free.living in a place where it snowed,and I would picture all of the storiesthat I would go on to tell.At the age of 19,the day after I graduated high school,I moved to a place where it snowedand I became a massage therapist.With this job all I needed were my handsand my massage table by my sideand I could go anywhere.For the first time in my life,I felt free, independentand completely in control of my life.That is, until my life took a detour.I went home from work early one daywith what I thought was the flu,and less than 24 hours laterI was in the hospitalon life supportwith less than a two percent chance of living.It wasn't until days lateras I lay in a comathat the doctors diagnosed mewith bacterial meningitis,a vaccine-preventable blood infection.Over the course of two and a half monthsI lost my spleen, my kidneys,the hearing in my left earand both of my legs below the knee.like a patchwork doll.I thought the worst was overuntil weeks later when I saw my new legsfor the first time.The calves were bulky blocks of metalwith pipes bolted together for the anklesand a yellow rubber footto look like a vein.I didn't know what to expect,but I wasn't expecting that.With my mom by my sideand tears streaming down our faces,I strapped on these chunky legsand I stood up.They were so painful and so confiningthat all I could think was,how am I ever going to travel the worldin these things?How was I ever going to livethe life full of adventure and stories,as I always wanted?And how was I going to snowboard again?That day, I went home, I crawled into bedand this is what my life looked likefor the next few months:me passed out, escaping from reality,with my legs resting by my side.But I knew that in order to move forward,I had to let go of the old Amyand learn to embrace the new Amy.And that is when it dawned on methat I didn't have to be five-foot-five anymore.I could be as tall as I wanted!(Laughter) (Applause)(Laughter)And if I snowboarded again,my feet aren't going to get cold.(Laughter)And best of all, I thought,And I did!So there were benefits here.It was this moment that I asked myselfthat life-defining question:If my life were a bookand I were the author,how would I want the story to go?And I began to daydream.I daydreamed like I did as a little girland I imagined myselfwalking gracefully,helping other people through my journeyand snowboarding again.And I didn't just see myselfcarving down a mountain of powder,I could actually feel it.I could feel the wind against my faceand the beat of my racing heartMy knees and my ankles wouldn't bendwhen I fell and my legs,still attached to my snowboard —(Laughter) —went flying down the mountain,and I was on top of the mountain still.I was so shocked,but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feetthat I would be able to do this again.one, stop us in our tracksor two, force us to get creative.what kind of legs to use,So I decided to make a pair myself.As you can see,And yes, I can change my toenail polish.It was these legsa new kidney from my dad —that allowed me to follow my dreams again.I started snowboarding,From there, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa,so they could attend school.And just this past February,(Applause) —which made mein the world.Eleven years ago, when I lost my legs,I had no idea what to expect.But if you ask me today,I would have to say no.Because my legs haven't disabled me,if anything they've enabled me.They've forced me to rely on my imaginationand to believe in the possibilities,and that's why I believethat our imaginations can be used as toolsfor breaking through borders,and we can be anything.It's believing in those dreamsand facing our fears head-onthat allows us to live our livesbeyond our limits.I have to say that in my life,innovation has only been possiblebecause of my borders.I've learned that borders are where the actual ends,but also where the imaginationand the story begins.as something negative or bad,we can begin to look at them as blessings,It's not about breaking down borders.It's about pushing off of themand seeing what amazing placesthey might bring us.Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.I would love to share with you a story.Once upon a timein 19th century Germany,there was the book.Now during this time,the book was the king of storytelling.It was venerable.It was ubiquitous.But it was a little bit boring.Because in its 400 years of existence,storytellers never evolved the bookas a storytelling device.But then one author arrived,and he changed the game forever.(Music)His name was Lothar,Lothar Meggendorfer.Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down,and he said, "Genug ist genug!"He grabbed his pen,he snatched his scissors.This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcyand just decided to fold.History would know Lothar Meggendorferas -- who else? --the world's first true inventorof the children's pop-up book.(Music)For this delight and for this wonder,people rejoiced.(Cheering)They were happy because the story survived,and that the world would keep on spinning.Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the firstto evolve the way a story was told,and he certainly wasn't the last.Whether storytellers realized it or not,they were channeling Meggendorfer's spiritwhen they moved opera to vaudville,radio news to radio theater,film to film in motionto film in sound, color, 3D,on VHS and on DVD.There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.(Laughter)Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world,but they could do sousing what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.For example, one companywould tell a story of lovethrough its very own search engine.One Taiwanese production studiowould interpret American politics in 3D.(Laughter)And one man would tell the stories of his fatherby using a platform called Twitterto communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.And after all this, everyone paused;they took a step back.They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling,they've gone from depicting hunting on cave wallsto depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls.And this was a cause for celebration.The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.And for the most part, the stories are recycled.But the way that humans tell the storieshas always evolvedwith pure, consistent novelty.And they remembered a man,one amazing German,every time a new storytelling devicepopped up next.And for that,the audience --the lovely, beautiful audience --would live happily ever after.(Applause)

I'd like to apologize, first of all, to all of youbecause I have no formof PowerPoint presentation.So what I'm going to dois, every now and again, I will make this gesture,and in a moment of PowerPoint democracy,you can imagine what you'd like to see.I do a radio show.The radio show is called "The Infinite Monkey Cage."It's about science, it's about rationalism.So therefore, we get a lot of complaintsevery single week --complaints including one we get very often,which is to say the very title, "Infinite Monkey Cage,"celebrates the idea of vivisection.We have made it quite clear to these peoplethat an infinite monkey cage is roomy.(Laughter)We also had someone else who said,"'The Infinite Monkey Cage' idea is ridiculous.An infinite number of monkeyscould never write the works of Shakespeare.We know this because they did an experiment."Yes, they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week,and after a week, they only used it as a bathroom.(Laughter)So the main element though, the main complaint we get --and one that I find most worrying --is that people say, "Oh, why do you insiston ruining the magic?You bring in science, and it ruins the magic."Now I'm an arts graduate;I love myth and magicand existentialism and self-loathing.That's what I do.But I also don't understandhow it does ruin the magic.All of the magic, I think,that may well be taken away by scienceis then replaced by something as wonderful.Astrology, for instance:like many rationalists, I'm a Pisces.(Laughter)Now astrology --we remove the banal ideathat your life could be predicted;that you'll, perhaps today, meet a lucky manwho's wearing a hat.That is gone.But if we want to look at the sky and see predictions, we still can.We can see predictions of galaxies forming,of galaxies colliding into each other, of new solar systems.This is a wonderful thing.If the Sun could one day -- and indeed the Earth, in fact --if the Earth could read its own astrological, astronomical chart,one day it would say,"Not a good day for making plans.You'll been engulfed by a red giant."And that to me as well,that if you think I'm worried about losing worlds,well Many Worlds theory --one of the most beautiful, fascinating,sometimes terrifying ideasfrom the quantum interpretation --is a wonderful thing.That every person here, every decision that you've made today,every decision you've made in your life,you've not really made that decision,but in fact, every single permutation of those decisionsis made, each one going off into a new universe.That is a wonderful idea.If you ever think that your life is rubbish,always rememberthere's another you that's made much worse decisions than that.(Laughter)If you ever think, "Ah, I want to end it all,"don't end it all.Remember that in the majority of universes,you don't even exist in the first place.This to me, in its own strange way,is very, very comforting.Now reincarnation, that's another thing gone -- the afterlife.But it's not gone.Science actually sayswe will live forever.Well, there is one proviso.We won't actually live forever. You won't live forever.Your consciousness, the you-ness of you, the me-ness of me --that gets this one go.But every single thing that makes us,every atom in us,has already created a myriad of different thingsand will go on to create a myriad of new things.We have been mountainsand apples and pulsarsand other people's knees.Who knows, maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee.That is a good thing.Unlike the occupants of the universe,the universe itself is not wasteful.We are all totally recyclable.And when we die,we don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs.This is a wonderful thing.Understanding, to me,does not remove the wonder and the joy.For instance, my wife could turn to me and she may say,"Why do you love me?"And I can with all honestylook her in the eye and say,"Because our pheromonesmatched our olfactory receptors."(Laughter)Though I'll probably also say somethingabout her hair and personality as well.And that is a wonderful thing there.Love does not die because of that thing.Pain doesn't go away either.This is a terrible thing, even though I understand pain.If someone punches me --and because of my personality,this is recently a regular occurrence --I understand where the pain comes from.It is basically momentum to energywhere the four-vector is constant -- that's what it is.But at no point can I react and go,"Ha! Is that the best momentum-to-energy fourth vector constant you've got?"No, I just spit out a tooth.(Laughter)And that is all of these different things -- the love for my child.I have a son. His name is Archie.I'm very lucky,because he's better than all the other children.Now I know you don't think that.You may well have your own childrenand think, "Oh no, my child's best."That's the wonderful thing about evolution --the predilection to believethat our child is best.Now in many ways, that's just a survival thing.The fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes,and therefore we love it.But we don't notice that bit; we just unconditionally love.That is a wonderful thing.Though I should say that my son is bestand is better than your children.I've done some tests.And all of these things to megive such joy and excitement and wonder.Even quantum mechanics can give you an excusefor bad housework, for instance.Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own.You house is in a terrible state.Your partner is about to return.You think, what should I do?Do nothing.All you have to dois, when she walks in, using a quantum interpretation,say, "I'm so sorry.I stopped observing the house for a moment,and when I started observing again,everything had happened."(Laughter)That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming.For me, it's a very, very important thing.Even on my journey up here --the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time.If you actually think, you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful.I'm sitting on a train.Every time I breathe in,I'm breathing in a million-billion-billionatoms of oxygen.I'm sitting on a chair.Even though I know the chair is made of atomsand therefore actually in many ways empty space,I find it comfortable.I look out the window, and I realizethat every single time we stop and I look out that window,framed in that window,wherever we are,I am observing more lifethan there is in the rest of the known universebeyond the planet Earth.If you go to the safari parkson Saturn or Jupiter,you will be disappointed.And I realize I'm observing thiswith the brain, the human brain,the most complex thing in the known universe.That, to me, is an incredible thing.And do you know what, that might be enough.Steven Weinberg, the Nobel laureate, once said,"The more the universe seems comprehensible,the more it seems pointless."Now for some people,that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism.But for me, it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing.I'm glad the universe is pointless.It means if I get to the end of my life,the universe can't turn to me and go, "What have you been doing, you idiot?That's not the point."I can make my own purpose.You can make your own purpose.We have the individual powerto go, "This is what I want to do."And in a pointless universe, that, to me, is a wonderful thing.I have chosen to make silly jokesabout quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation.You, I imagine, can do much better things with your time.Thank you very much. Goodbye.(Applause)

I've always had a fascination for computers and technology,and I made a few apps for the iPhone,iPod Touch, and iPad.I'd like to share a couple with you today.My first app was a unique fortune teller called Earth Fortunethat would display different colors of earthdepending on what your fortune was.My favorite and most successful app isBustin Jieber, which is â (Laughter) âwhich is a Justin Bieber Whac-A-Mole.I created it because a lot of people at schooldisliked Justin Bieber a little bit,so I decided to make the app.So I went to work programming it,and I released it just before the holidays in 2010.A lot of people ask me, how did I make these?A lot of times it's because the person who askedthe question wants to make an app also.A lot of kids these days like to play games,but now they want to make them,and it's difficult,because not many kids know where to goto find out how to make a program.I mean, for soccer, you could go to a soccer team.For violin, you could get lessons for a violin.But what if you want to make an app?And their parents, the kid's parents might have donesome of these things when they were young,but not many parents have written apps. (Laughter)Where do you go to find out how to make an app?Well, this is how I approached it. This is what I did.First of all, I've been programming in multipleother programming languages to get the basics down,such as Python, C, Java, etc.And then Apple released the iPhone,and with it, the iPhone software development kit,and the software development kit is a suite of toolsfor creating and programming an iPhone app.This opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me,and after playing with the software development kita little bit, I made a couple apps, I made some test apps.One of them happened to be Earth Fortune, and I wasready to put Earth Fortune on the App Store,and so I persuaded my parents to pay the 99 dollar feeto be able to put my apps on the App Store.They agreed, and now I have apps on the App Store.I've gotten a lot of interest and encouragementfrom my family, friends, teachersand even people at the Apple Store,and that's been a huge help to me.I've gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs,and I've started an app club at school, and a teacherat my school is kindly sponsoring my app club.Any student at my school can come andlearn how to design an app.This is so I can share my experiences with others.There's these programs called the iPad Pilot Program,and some districts have them.I'm fortunate enough to be part of one.A big challenge is, how should the iPads be used,and what apps should we put on the iPads?So we're getting feedback from teachers at the schoolto see what kind of apps they'd like.When we design the app and we sell it,it will be free to local districts and other districtsthat we sell to, all the money from that will go intothe local ed foundations.These days, students usually know a little bit morethan teachers with the technology. (Laughter)So -- (Laughter) --sorry -- (Laughter) --so this is a resource to teachers, and educatorsshould recognize this resource and make good use of it.I'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future.First of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games.I'm working with a third party company to make an app.I'd like to get into Android programming and development,and I'd like to continue my app club,and find other ways for studentsto share knowledge with others. Thank you. (Applause)

I started Improv Everywhere about 10 years agowhen I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy.Because I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage,so I decided to create my own in public places.So the first project we're going to take a look atis the very first No Pants Subway Ride.Now this took place in January of 2002.And this woman is the star of the video.She doesn't know she's being filmed.She's being filmed with a hidden camera.This is on the 6 train in New York City.And this is the first stop along the line.These are two Danish guyswho come out and sit down next to the hidden camera.And that's me right there in a brown coat.It's about 30 degrees outside.I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.And the girl's going to notice me right here.(Laughter)And as you'll see now, I'm not wearing pants.(Laughter)So at this point --at this point she's noticed me,but in New York there's weirdos on any given train car.One person's not that unusual.She goes back to reading her book, which is unfortunately titled "Rape."(Laughter)So she's noticed the unusual thing,but she's gone back to her normal life.Now in the meantime, I have six friendswho are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well.They're going to be entering this car one by one.We'll act as though we don't know each other.And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made,forgetting our pants on this cold January day.(Laughter)So at this point,she decides to put the rape book away.(Laughter)And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings.Now in the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera,they're cracking up.They think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before.And watch her make eye contact with them right about now.(Laughter)And I love that moment in this video,because before it became a shared experience,it was something that was maybe a little bit scary,or something that was at least confusing to her.And then once it became a shared experience,it was funny and something that she could laugh at.So the train is now pulling intothe third stop along the 6 line.(Laughter)So the video won't show everything.This goes on for another four stops.A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear.At the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bagand announced she had pants for sale for a dollar --like you might sell batteries or candy on the train.We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants, put them onand said, "Thank you. That's exactly what I needed today,"and then exited without revealing what had happenedand went in all different directions.(Applause)Thank you.So that's a still from the video there.And I love that girl's reaction so much.And watching that videotape later that dayinspired me to keep doing what I do.And really one of the points of Improv Everywhereis to cause a scene in a public placethat is a positive experience for other people.It's a prank, but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell.And her reaction inspired meto do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride.And we've continued to do it every year.This January, we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ridewhere a diverse group of 3,500 peoplerode the train in their underwear in New York --almost every single train line in the city.And also in 50 other cities around the world,people participated.(Laughter)As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theaterand meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians,I started amassing a mailing listof people who wanted to do these types of projects.So I could do more large-scale projects.Well one day I was walking through Union Square,and I saw this building,which had just been built in 2005.And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing.And it was very peculiar,because it was dark out, but she was back-lit with florescent lighting,and she was very much onstage,and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it.After about 15 seconds, her friend appeared --she had been hiding behind a display --and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away.So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this.So I got inspired by that.Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows --and I knew what I had to do.(Laughter)So this project is called Look Up More. We had 70 actors dress in black.This was completely unauthorized.We didn't let the stores know we were coming.And I stood in the park giving signals.The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall lettersthat spelled out "Look Up More,"the name of the project.The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together.You'll see that start right here.(Laughter)And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance.And then we had dance solos where only one person would danceand everybody would point to them.(Laughter)So then I gave a new hand signal,which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21,and he danced.There were several other activities.We had people jumping up and down,people dropping to the ground.And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt,putting my hand on and off of a trashcanto signal the advancement.And because it was in Union Square Park, right by a subway station,there were hundreds of people by the endwho stopped and looked upand watched what we were doing.There's a better photo of it.So that particular eventwas inspired by a momentthat I happened to stumble upon.The next project I want to showwas given to me in an email from a stranger.A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006and said, "You should get as many people as possibleto put on blue polo shirts and khaki pantsand go into a Best Buy and stand around."(Laughter)(Applause)So I wrote this high school kid back immediately,and I said, "Yes, you are correct.I think I'll try to do that this weekend. Thank you."So here's the video.So again, this is 2005.This is the Best Buy in New York City.We had about 80 people show up to participate,entering one-by-one.There was an eight year-old girl, a 10 year-old girl.There was also a 65 year-old manwho participated.So a very diverse group of people.And I told people, "Don't work. Don't actually do work.But also, don't shop.Just stand around and don't face products."Now you can see the regular employeesby the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt.Everybody else is one of our actors.(Laughter)The lower level employees thought it was very funny.And in fact, several of them went to go get their camera from the break roomand took photos with us.A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the backto get heavy television sets for customers.The managers and the security guards, on the other hand,did not find it particularly funny.You can see them in this footage.They're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt.And we were there probably 10 minutesbefore the managers decided to dial 911.(Laughter)So they started running aroundtelling everybody the cops were coming, watch out, the cops were coming.And you can see the cops in this footage right here.That's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera.Ultimately, the police had to inform Best Buy managementthat it was not, in fact, illegalto wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants.(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)So we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store.One thing the managers were trying to dowas to track down our cameras.And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.But the one camera guy they never caughtwas the guy that went in just with a blank tapeand went over to the Best Buy camera departmentand just put his tape in one of their camerasand pretended to shop.So I like that concept of using their own technology against them.(Laughter)I think our best projects are ones that are site specificand happen at a particular place for a reason.And one morning, I was riding the subway.I had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stopwhere there are these two giant escalators.And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning, it's very crowded.So I decided to try and stage somethingthat could make it as happy as possible for one morning.So this was in the winter of 2009 --8:30 in the morning.It's morning rush hour.It's very cold outside.People are coming in from Queens,transferring from the E train to the 6 train.And they're going up these giant escalatorson their way to their jobs.(Laughter)(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you.So there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better.He gave 2,000 high fives that day,and he washed his hands before and afterwardand did not get sick.And that was done also without permission,although no one seemed to care.So I'd say over the years,one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhereleft anonymously on YouTube commentsis: "These people have too much time on their hands."And you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do,and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments,but that one's always bothered me,because we don't have too much time on our hands.The participants at Improv Everywhere eventshave just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers,they just occasionally chooseto spend it in an unusual way.You know, every Saturday and Sunday,hundreds of thousands of people each fallgather in football stadiums to watch games.And I've never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game,saying, "All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands."And of course they don't.It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon,watching a football game in a stadium.But I think it's also a perfectly valid wayto spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 peoplein the Grand Central terminalor dressing up like a ghostbusterand running through the New York Public Library.(Laughter)Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other peopleand dancing silently in a park,or bursting into song in a grocery storeas part of a spontaneous musical,or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire.You know, as kids, we're taught to play.And we're never given a reason why we should play.It's just acceptable that play is a good thing.And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere.It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.We don't need a reason.As long as it's funand it seems like it's going to be a funny ideaand it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time,then that's enough for us.And I think, as adults, we need to learnthat there's no right or wrong way to play.Thank you very much.(Applause)

So magic is a very introverted field.While scientists regularly publish their latest research,we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.That's true even amongst peers.But if you look at creative practice as a form of research,or art as a form of R&amp;D for humanity,then how could a cyber illusionist like myselfshare his research?Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.And about three years ago,I started an exercisein openness and inclusivenessby reaching out into the open-source software communityto create new digital tools for magic --tools that could eventually be shared with other artiststo start them off further on in the processand to get them to the poetry faster.Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.It's an augmented realityprojection tracking and mapping system,or a digital storytelling tool.Could we bring down the lights please? Thank you.So let's give this a try.And I'm going to use itto give you my takeon the stuff of life.(Applause)(Music)Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor.Wake up.Hey.Come on.(Music)Please.(Music)Come on.Ah, sorry about that.Forgot this.(Music)Give it another try.Okay.He figured out the system.(Music)(Laughter)(Applause)(Music)Uh oh.(Music)All right. Let's try this.Come on.(Music)(Laughter)(Music)Hey.(Music)You heard her, go ahead.(Laughter)(Applause)Bye-bye.(Applause)

I am a conductor,and I'm here todayto talk to you about trust.My job depends upon it.There has to be, between me and the orchestra,an unshakable bond of trust,born out of mutual respect,through which we can spin a musical narrativethat we all believe in.Now in the old days, conducting, music making,was less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion.Up to and around about the Second World War,conductors were invariably dictators --these tyrannical figureswho would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it,within an inch of their lives.But I'm happy to say now that the world has moved on,music has moved on with it.We now have a more democratic view and way of making music --a two-way street.I, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron senseof the outer architecture of that music,within which there is then immense personal freedomfor the members of the orchestra to shine.For myself, of course,I have to completely trust my body language.That's all I have at the point of sale.It's silent gesture.I can hardly bark out instructions while we're playing.(Music)Ladies and gentlemen, the Scottish Ensemble.(Applause)So in order for all this to work,obviously I have got to be in a position of trust.I have to trust the orchestra,and, even more crucially, I have to trust myself.Think about it: when you're in a position of not trusting,what do you do?You overcompensate.And in my game, that means you overgesticulate.You end up like some kind of rabid windmill.And the bigger your gesture gets,the more ill-defined, blurryand, frankly, useless it is to the orchestra.You become a figure of fun. There's no trust anymore, only ridicule.And I remember at the beginning of my career,again and again, on these dismal outings with orchestras,I would be going completely insane on the podium,trying to engender a small scale crescendo really,just a little upsurge in volume.Bugger me, they wouldn't give it to me.I spent a lot of time in those early yearsweeping silently in dressing rooms.And how futile seemed the words of advice to mefrom great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Daviswho said, "Conducting, Charles,is like holding a small bird in your hand.If you hold it too tightly, you crush it.If you hold it too loosely, it flies away."I have to say, in those days, I couldn't really even find the bird.Now a fundamentaland really viscerally important experience for me, in terms of music,has been my adventures in South Africa,the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view,but a country which, through its musical culture,has taught me one fundamental lesson:that through music makingcan come deep levelsof fundamental life-giving trust.Back in 2000, I had the opportunity to go to South Africato form a new opera company.So I went out there, and I auditioned,mainly in rural township locations, right around the country.I heard about 2,000 singersand pulled together a companyof 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers,the majority of whom were black,but there were a handful of white performers.Now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal periodthat one of those white performershad, in his previous incarnation,been a member of the South African police force.And in the last years of the old regime,he would routinely be detailed to go into the townshipto aggress the community.Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room,the general atmosphere.Let's be under no illusions.In South Africa, the relationship most devoid of trustis that between a white policemanand the black community.So how do we recover from that, ladies and gentlemen?Simply through singing.We sang, we sang,we sang,and amazingly new trust grew,and indeed friendship blossomed.And that showed me such a fundamental truth,that music making and other forms of creativitycan so often go to placeswhere mere words cannot.So we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally.One of them was "Carmen."We then thought we'd make a movie of "Carmen,"which we recorded and shot outside on locationin the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha.The piece was sung entirely in Xhosa,which is a beautifully musical language, if you don't know it.It's called "U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha" --literally "Carmen of Khayelitsha."I want to play you a tiny clip of it nowfor no other reason than to give you proof positivethat there is nothing tiny about South African music making.(Music)(Applause)Something which I find utterly enchantingabout South African music makingis that it's so free.South Africans just make music really freely.And I think, in no small way,that's due to one fundamental fact:they're not bound to a system of notation.They don't read music.They trust their ears.You can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat.And then, as if by magic,they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tunebecause they can.Now those of us that live in the West, if I can use that term,I think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music --that somehow it's all about skill and systems.Therefore it's the exclusive preserveof an elite, talented body.And yet, ladies and gentlemen, every single one of us on this planetprobably engages with music on a daily basis.And if I can broaden this out for a second,I'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this roomwould be happy to speak with acuity, with total confidence,about movies, probably about literature.But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertionabout a piece of classical music?Why is this?And what I'm going to say to you nowis I'm just urging you to get overthis supreme lack of self-confidence,to take the plunge, to believe that you can trust your ears,you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue,fiber, DNA,what makes a great piece of music great.I've got a little experiment I want to try with you.Did you knowthat TED is a tune?A very simple tune based on three notes -- T, E, D.Now hang on a minute.I know you're going to say to me, "T doesn't exist in music."Well ladies and gentlemen, there's a time-honored system,which composers have been using for hundreds of years,which proves actually that it does.If I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G --and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale:H, I, J, K, L, M, N,O, P, Q, R, S, T -- there you go.T, see it's the same as F in music.So T is F.So T, E, D is the same as F, E, D.Now that piece of music that we played at the start of this sessionhad enshrined in its heartthe theme, which is TED.Have a listen.(Music)Do you hear it?Or do I smell some doubt in the room?Okay, we'll play it for you again now,and we're going to highlight, we're going to poke out the T, E, D.If you'll pardon the expression.(Music)Oh my goodness me, there it was loud and clear, surely.I think we should make this even more explicit.Ladies and gentlemen, it's nearly time for tea.Would you reckon you need to sing for your tea, I think?I think we need to sing for our tea.We're going to sing those three wonderful notes: T, E, D.Will you have a go for me?Audience: T, E, D.Charles Hazlewood: Yeah, you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings.Shall we try that one again?And look, if you're adventurous, you go up the octave.T, E, D.Audience: T, E, D.CH: Once more with vim. (Audience: T, E, D.)There I am like a bloody windmill again, you see.Now we're going to put that in the context of the music.The music will start, and then at a signal from me, you will sing that.(Music)One more time,with feeling, ladies and gentlemen.You won't make the key otherwise.Well done, ladies and gentlemen.It wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir,not a bad debut at all.Now there's a project that I'm initiating at the momentthat I'm very excited about and wanted to share with you,because it is all about changing perceptions,and, indeed, building a new level of trust.The youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy,which as you can imagine,if you don't have an experience of it yourself,is quite a big thing to take on board.But the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me,aside from her very existence,is that it's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the communitythat was hitherto hidden,the community of disabled people.And I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incrediblehow technology's been harnessed to prove beyond doubtthat disability is no barrierto the highest levels of sporting achievement.Of course there's a grimmer side to that truth,which is that it's actually taken decades for the world at largeto come to a position of trust,to really believe that disability and sports can go togetherin a convincing and interesting fashion.So I find myself asking:where is music in all of this?You can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people,in the U.K. alone,with massive musical potential.So I decided to create a platform for that potential.It's going to be Britain's first evernational disabled orchestra.It's called Paraorchestra.I'm going to show you a clip nowof the very first improvisation session that we had.It was a really extraordinary moment.Just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians.Normally when you improvise --and I do it all the time around the world --there's this initial period of horror,like everyone's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring,an awful pregnant silence.Then suddenly, as if by magic, bang! We're all in thereand it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything.No one's listening. No one's trusting.No one's responding to each other.Now in this room with these four disabled musicians,within five minutesa rapt listening, a rapt responseand some really insanely beautiful music.(Video) (Music)Nicholas:: My name's Nicholas McCarthy.I'm 22, and I'm a left-handed pianist.And I was born without my left hand -- right hand.Can I do that one again?(Music)Lyn: When I'm making music,I feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane.I become alive.(Music)Clarence: I would rather be able to play an instrument againthan walk.There's so much joy and thingsI could get from playing an instrument and performing.It's removed some of my paralysis.(Music)(Applause)CH: I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today,so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are.Paraorchestra is the name of that project.If any of you thinks you want to help me in any wayto achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point,please let me know.Now my parting shotcomes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn,wonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the 18th century --spent the bulk of his lifein the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy, along with his orchestra.Now this prince loved his music,but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time,which is just on the Austro-Hungarian border,a place called Esterhazy --a long way from the big city of Vienna.Now one day in 1772,the prince decreed that the musicians' families,the orchestral musicians' families,were no longer welcome in the castle.They weren't allowed to stay there anymore; they had to be returned to Vienna --as I say, an unfeasibly long way away in those days.You can imagine, the musicians were disconsolate.Haydn remonstrated with the prince, but to no avail.So given the prince loved his music,Haydn thought he'd write a symphony to make the point.And we're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now.And you'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt.I'm pleased to say, the prince did take the tipfrom the orchestral performance,and the musicians were reunited with their families.But I think it sums up my talk rather well, this,that where there is trust,there is music -- by extension life.Where there is no trust,the music quite simply withers away.(Music)(Applause)

I was born in Switzerlandand raised in Ghana, West Africa.Ghana felt safe to me as a child.I was free, I was happy.The early 70smarked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana.But then by the end of the decade,the country had fallen back into political instabilityand mismanagement.In 1979,I witnessed my first military coup.We the children had gathered at a friend's house.It was a dimly lit shack.There was a beaten up black and white televisionflickering in the background,and a former head of state and generalwas being blindfoldedand tied to the pole.The firing squad aimed, fired --the general was dead.Now this was being broadcast live.And shortly after, we left the country,and we returned to Switzerland.Now Europe came as a shock to me,and I think I started feeling the needto shed my skin in order to fit in.I wanted to blend in like a chameleon.I think it was a tactic of survival.And it worked, or so I believed.So here I was in 2008wondering where I was in my life.And I felt I was being typecast as an actor.I was always playing the exotic African.I was playing the violent African,the African terrorist.And I was thinking,how many terrorists could I possibly playbefore turning into one myself?And I had become ashamed of the other,the African in me.And fortunately I decided in 2008to return to Ghana,after 28 years of absence.I wanted to document on filmthe 2008 presidential elections.And there, I started by searchingfor the footprints in my childhood.And before I even knew it,I was suddenly on a stagesurrounded by thousands of cheering peopleduring a political rally.And I realized that, when I'd left the country,free and fair elections in a democratic environmentwere a dream.And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality,though a fragile reality.And I was thinking,was Ghana searching for its identitylike I was looking for my identity?Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphorfor what was happening in me?And it was as if through the standards of my Western life,I hadn't lived up to my full potential.I mean, nor had Ghana,even though we had been trying very hard.Now in 1957,Ghana was the first sub-Saharan countryto gain its independence.In the late 50s,Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP.I mean, today, Singapore is a First World countryand Ghana is not.But maybe it was time to prove to myself,yes, it's important to understand the past,it is important to look at it in a different light,but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own cultureand build on those foundations in the present.So here I was, December 7th, 2008.The polling stations opened to the voters at 7:00 AM,but voters, eager to take their own political fate into their hands,were starting to line up at 4:00 AM in the morning.And they had traveled from near, they had traveled from far,because they wanted to make their voices heard.And I asked one of the voters, I said, "Whom are you going to vote for?"And he said, "I'm sorry, I can't tell you."He said that his vote was in his heart.And I understood, this was their election,and they weren't going to let anyonetake it away from them.Now the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner --so nobody had achieved the absolute majority --so voting went into a second round three weeks later.The candidates were back on the road; they were campaigning.The rhetoric of the candidates, of course, changed.The heat was on.And then the cliche came to haunt us.There were claims of intimidationat the polling stations,of ballot boxes being stolen.Inflated results started coming inand the mob was starting to get out of control.We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets.People were being beaten brutally.The army started firing their guns. People were scrambling.It was complete chaos.And my heart sank,because I thought, here we are again.Here is another proofthat the African is not capable of governing himself.And not only that, I am documenting it --documenting my own cultural shortcomings.So when the echo of the gunshotshad lingered,it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob,and I didn't believe what I was hearing.They were chanting, "We want peace.We want peace."And I realized it had to come from the people.After all, they decide,and they did.So the sounds that were before distorted and loud,were suddenly a melody.The sounds of the voices were harmonious.So it could happen.A democracy could be upheld peacefully.It could be, by the will of the masseswho were now urgently pressingwith all their heart and all their willfor peace.Now here's an interesting comparison.We in the West,we preach the values,the golden light of democracy,that we are the shining example of how it's done.But when it comes down to it,Ghana found itself in the same placein which the U.S. election stalledin the 2000 presidential elections --Bush versus Gore.But instead of the unwillingness of the candidatesto allow the system to proceed and the people to decide,Ghana honored democracyand its people.It didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide;the people did.Now the second round of votingdid not bring forth a clear winner either.I mean, it was so incredibly close.The electoral commissioner declared,with the consent of the parties,to run an unprecedentedsecond re-run.So the people went back to the pollsto determine their own president,not the legal system.And guess what, it worked.The defeated candidategave up powerand made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle.I mean, at the absolute timefor the absolute need of democracy,they did not abuse their power.The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep,proving that the African is capable of governing himself.Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africais not over,but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists,and that we must not take it for granted.Now I have learnedthat my place is not just in the West or in Africa,and I'm still searchingfor my identity,but I saw Ghanacreate democracy better.Ghana taught meto look at people differentlyand to look at myself differently.And yes,we Africans can.Thank you.(Applause)

I want to say that really and truly,after these incredible speechesand ideas that are being spread,I am in the awkward positionof being here to talk to you todayabout television.So most everyone watches TV.We like it. We like some parts of it.Here in America, people actually love TV.The average American watches TVfor almost 5 hours a day.Okay?Now I happen to make my living these days in television,so for me, that's a good thing.But a lot of people don't love it so much.They, in fact, berate it.They call it stupid,and worse, believe me.My mother, growing up,she called it the "idiot box."But my idea today is not to debatewhether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV;my idea todayis to tell you that I believetelevision has a conscience.So why I believe that television has a conscienceis that I actually believethat television directly reflectsthe moral, political,social and emotional need states of our nation --that television is how we actually disseminateour entire value system.So all these things are uniquely human,and they all add upto our idea of conscience.Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.We're talking about popular TV.We're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated showsover the course of 50 years.How do these Nielsen ratingsreflect not just what you've heard about,which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious,but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated showsover 50 yearsreflect the ideaof our social conscience?How does television evolve over time,and what does this say about our society?Now speaking of evolution,from basic biology, you probably rememberthat the animal kingdom, including humans,have four basic primal instincts.You have hunger; you have sex; you have power;and you have the urge for acquisitiveness.As humans, what's important to rememberis that we've developed, we've evolved over timeto temper, or tame,these basic animal instincts.We have the capacity to laugh and cry.We feel awe, we feel pity.That is separate and apartfrom the animal kingdom.The other thing about human beingsis that we love to be entertained.We love to watch TV.This is something that clearly separates usfrom the animal kingdom.Animals might love to play,but they don't love to watch.So I had an ambitionto discover what could be understoodfrom this uniquely human relationshipbetween television programsand the human conscious.Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has?I kind of think of itas this cartoon devil or angelsitting on our shoulders.Is television literally functioningas our conscience,tempting us and rewarding us at the same time?So to begin to answer these questions,we did a research study.We went back 50 yearsto the 1959/1960 television season.We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen showsevery year for 50 years --a thousand shows.We talked to over 3,000 individuals --almost 3,600 --aged 18 to 70,and we asked them how they felt emotionally.How did you feelwatching every single one of these shows?Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity?Did you feel outrage? Did you laugh?What did this mean for you?So to our global TED audiences,I want to say that this was a U.S. sample.But as you can see,these emotional need states are truly universal.And on a factual basis,over 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular showsare exported around the world.So I really hope our global audiencescan relate.Two acknowledgmentsbefore our first data slide:For inspiring meto even think about the idea of conscienceand the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis,I thank legendary rabbi, Jack Stern.And for the way in which I'm going to present the data,I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling,who you may have just seen.Okay, here we go.So here you see,from 1960 to 2010,the 50 years of our study.Two things we're going to start with --the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state,which, for this purpose,we defined inspirationas television shows that uplift me,that make me feel much more positive about the world.Moral ambiguity are televisions showsin which I don't understandthe difference between right and wrong.As we start, you see in 1960inspiration is holding steady.That's what we're watching TV for.Moral ambiguity starts to climb.Right at the end of the 60s,moral ambiguity is going up,inspiration is kind of on the wane.Why?The Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot,the Civil Rights movement,race riots, the Vietnam War,MLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot,Watergate.Look what happens.In 1970, inspiration plummets.Moral ambiguity takes off.They cross,but Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office.It's trying to recover.But look, it can't:AIDS, Iran-Contra,the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl.Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in televisionfrom 1990 for the next 20 years.Take a look at this.This chart is going to document a very similar trend.But in this case, we have comfort -- the bubble in red --social commentary and irreverencein blue and green.Now this time on TVyou have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke,"you have "Andy Griffith,"you have domestic shows all about comfort.This is rising. Comfort stays whole.Irreverence starts to rise.Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.You get to 1969, and look what happens.You have comfort, irreverence, and social commentary,not only battling it out in our society,but you literally have two establishment shows --"Gunsmoke" and "Gomer Pyle" --in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows.What's number one?The socially irreverent hippie show,"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."They're all living together, right.Viewers had responded dramatically.Look at this green spike in 1966to a bellwether show.When you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit,what does that mean?It means in the 1966 television season,The "Smothers Brothers" came out of nowhere.This was the first showthat allowed viewers to say,"My God,I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War,about the presidency, through television?"That's what we mean by a breakout show.So then, just like the last chart, look what happens.In 1970,the dam bursts. The dam bursts.Comfort is no longer why we watch television.Social commentary and irreverencerise throughout the 70s.Now look at this.The 70s means who? Norman Lear.You have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son,"and the dominant show --in the top-10 for the entire 70s --"MAS*H."In the entire 50 yearsof television that we studied,seven of 10 showsranked most highly for irreverenceappeared on air during the Vietnam War,five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration.Only one generation, 20 years in,and we discovered,Wow! TV can do that?It can make me feel this?It can change us?So to this very, very savvy crowd,I also want to notethe digital folks did not invent disruptive.Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chairalong with the rest of us40 years ago.This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute:fantasy and imagination,which are shows defined as,"takes me out of my everyday realm"and "makes me feel better."That's mapped against the red dot, unemployment,which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic.You'll seethat every time fantasy and imagination shows rise,it maps to a spike in unemployment.Do we want to see showsabout people saving money and being unemployed?No. In the 70syou have the bellwether show "The Bionic Woman"that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973,followed by the "Six Million-Dollar Man" and "Charlie's Angels."Another spike in the 1980s --another spike in shows about control and power.What were those shows?Glamorous and rich."Dallas," "Fantasy Island."Incredible mapping of our national psychewith some hard and fast facts:unemployment.So here you are, in my favorite chart,because this is our last 20 years.Whether or not you're in my business,you have surely heard or readof the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcomand the rise of reality TV.Well, as we say in the business,X marks the spot.The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor --we're watching "Friends," "Frasier," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld."Everything's good, low unemployment.But look: X marks the spot.In 2001,the September 2001 television season,humor succumbs to judgment once and for all.Why not?We had a 2000 presidential electiondecided by the Supreme Court.We had the bursting of the tech bubble.We had 9/11.Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon.Look what happens when we keep going.At the turn of the century, the Internet takes off,reality television has taken hold.What do people want in their TV then?I would have thought revengeor nostalgia.Give me some comfort; my world is falling apart.No, they want judgment.I can vote you off the island.I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing.I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired.That's all great, right?So as dramatically different as these television shows,pure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years --what did I start with? --one basic instinct remains.We're animals, we need our moms.There has not been a decade of televisionwithout a definitive, dominant TV mom.The 1950s:June Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver."Lucille Ball kept us laughingthrough the rise of social consciousness in the 60s.Maude Findlay,the epitome of the irreverent 1970s,who tackled abortion, divorce,even menopause on TV.The 1980s,our first cougar was given to usin the form of Alexis Carrington.Murphy Brown took on a vice presidentwhen she took on the idea of single parenthood.This era's mom,Bree Van de Kamp.Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angelsitting on our conscience,sitting on television's shoulders,but I do know that I absolutely love this image.So to you all,the women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen,the global audiences of TEDWomen,thank you for letting me present my ideaabout the conscience of television.But let me also thank the incredible creatorswho get up everydayto put their ideas on our television screensthroughout all these ages of television.They give it life on television, for sure,but it's you as viewers,through your collective social consciences,that give it life, longevity,power or not.So thanks very much.(Applause)

Hi everyone.I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.Thank you.And I want to share with you my latest art project.It's a children's book for the iPad.It's a little quirky and silly.It's called "Pop-It,"And it's about the things little kids do with their parents.(Music)So this is about potty training --as most of you, I hope, know.You can tickle the rug.You can make the baby poop.You can do all those fun things.You can burst bubbles.You can draw, as everyone should.But you know, I have a problem with children's books:I think they're full of propaganda.At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.It's not the way I was brought up.So I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."If you notice carefully,it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.You don't like it?Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.(Laughter)Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family.I have to tell you about my childhood.I went to this very proper Christian schooltaught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan,and I am.And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house,which was probably the only Hindu housein a predominantly Islamic neighborhood.Basically, I celebrated every religious function.In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood,all of us would paint our houses for the wedding.I remember we cried profuselywhen the little goats we played with in the summerbecame biriani.(Laughter)We all had to fast during Ramadan.It was a very beautiful time.But I must say,I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.Babri Masjid --one of the most beautiful mosques in India,built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century --was demolished by Hindu activists.This caused major riots in my city.And for the first time,I was affectedby this communal unrest.My little five-year-old kid neighborcomes running in,and he says, "Rags, Rags.You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful."I'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."(Laughter)He's like, "Huh!"You know, my work is inspiredby events such as this.Even in my gallery shows,I try and revisit historic eventslike Babri Masjid,distill only its emotional residueand image my own life.Imagine history being taught differently.Remember that children's bookwhere you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?I have another idea.It's a children's book about Indian independence --very patriotic.But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.Shake it again, and you get the British perspective.(Applause)You have to separate fact from bias, right.Even my books on childrenhave cute, fuzzy animals.But they're playing geopolitics.They're playing out Israel-Palestine,India-Pakistan.You know, I'm making a very important argument.And my argument [is]that the only way for us to teach creativityis by teaching children perspectivesat the earliest stage.After all, children's books are manuals on parenting,so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.And conversely,only when you teach perspectiveswill a child be able to imagineand put themselves in the shoesof someone who is different from them.I'm making an argument that art and creativityare very essential tools in empathy.You know, I can't promise my childa life without bias --we're all biased --but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.Thank you very much.(Applause)

I am the daughter of a forger,not just any forger ...When you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary."You understand "forged currency," "forged pictures."My father is no such man.For 30 years of his life,he made false papers --never for himself, always for other people,and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed.Let me introduce him.Here is my father at age 19.It all began for him during World War II,when at age 17 he found himself thrustinto a forged documents workshop.He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.And it's not a banal story --after the liberation he continuedto make false papers until the '70s.When I was a childI knew nothing about this, of course.This is me in the middle making faces.I grew up in the Paris suburbsand I was the youngest of three children.I had a "normal" dad like everybody else,apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.Anyway, he was a photographer and a street educator,and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly.And, of course, he never talked about his past lifewhen he was a forger.There was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about,that perhaps could have led me suspect something.I was in high school and got a bad grade,a rare event for me,so I decided to hide it from my parents.In order to do that, I set out to forge their signature.I started working on my mother's signature,because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge.So, I got working. I took some sheets of paperand started practicing, practicing, practicing,until I reached what I thought was a steady hand,and went into action.Later, while checking my school bag,my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.She yelled at me like she never had before.I went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets,and then I waited for my father to come back from workwith, one could say, much apprehension.I heard him come in.I remained under the blankets. He entered my room,sat on the corner of the bed,and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head,and when he saw me he started laughing.He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"Indeed, it's rather small.I was born in Algeria.There I would hear people say my father was a "moudjahid"and that means "fighter."Later on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations,and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life,especially that he had "done" World War II,that he had "done" the Algerian war.And in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier.But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent,I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.And indeed, I was very far from the mark.One day, while my father was working on a filefor us to obtain French nationality,I happened to see some documentsthat caught my attention.These are real!These are mine, I was born an Argentinean.But the document I happened to seethat would help us build a case for the authoritieswas a document from the armythat thanked my father for his workon behalf of the secret services.And then, suddenly, I went "wow!"My father, a secret agent?It was very James Bond.I wanted to ask him questions, which he didn't answer.And later, I told myself thatone day I would have to question him.And then I became a mother and had a son,and finally decided it was time -- that he absolutely had to talk to us.I had become a motherand he was celebrating his 77th birthday,and suddenly I was very, very afraid.I feared he'd goand take his silences with him,and take his secrets with him.I managed to convince him that it was important for us,but possibly also for other peoplethat he shared his story.He decided to tell it to meand I made a book,from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later.So, his story. My father was born in Argentina.His parents were of Russian descent.The whole family came to settle in France in the '30s.His parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.So at the age of 14 my father had to work.And with his only diploma,his primary education certificate,he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner.That's where he discovered something totally magical,and when he talks about it, it's fascinating --it's the magic of dyeing chemistry.During that time the war was happeningand his mother was killed when he was 15.This coincided with the time whenhe threw himself body and soul into chemistrybecause it was the only consolation for his sadness.All day he would ask many questions to his bossto learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge,and at night, when no one was looking,he'd put his experience to practice.He was mostly interested in ink bleaching.All this to tell youthat if my father became a forger, actually,it was almost by accident.His family was Jewish, so they were hounded.Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy campand they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers.Well, they were out,but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers.It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents.My father had been instilled with such respect for the lawthat although he was being persecuted,he'd never thought of false papers.But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance.In those times documents had hard covers,they were filled in by hand,and they stated your job.In order to survive, he neededto be working. He asked the manto write "dyer."Suddenly the man looked very, very interested.As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?Of course he knew.And suddenly the man started explaining thatactually the whole Resistance had a huge problem:even the top expertscould not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible,"the "Waterman" blue ink.And my father immediately replied that he knew exactlyhow to bleach it.Now, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17who could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him.And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented somethingwe can find in every schoolchild's pencil case:the so-called "correction pen."(Applause)But it was only the beginning.That's my father.As soon as he got to the lab,even though he was the youngest,he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents.All the movements stopped at falsifying.But demand was ever-growingand it was difficult to tamper with existing documents.He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.He started a press. He started photoengraving.He started making rubber stamps.He started inventing all kind of things --with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel.Anyway, he had to do all thisbecause he was completely obsessed with output.He had made a simple calculation:In one hour he could make 30 forged documents.If he slept one hour, 30 people would die.This sense ofresponsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 --and also his guilt for being a survivor,since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not --stayed with him all his life.And this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years,he continued to make false papersat the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.I'd like to talk about those sacrifices,because there were many.There were obviously financial sacrificesbecause he always refused to be paid.To him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary.If he had accepted payment,he wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no"depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.So he was a photographer by day,and a forger by night for 30 years.He was broke all of the time.Then there were the emotional sacrifices:How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets?How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?Of course, there was another kind of sacrificeinvolving his family that I understood much later.One day my father introduced me to my sister.He also explained to me that I had a brother, too,and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four,and they were 30 years older than me.They are both in their sixties now.In order to write the book,I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was,who was the father she had known.She explained that the father that she'd hadwould tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk.They would get all dressed up and wait for him,but he would almost never come.He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.And then he would not come.Then one day he totally disappeared.Time passed,and they thought he had surely forgotten them,at first.Then as time passed,at the end of almost two years, they thought,"Well, perhaps our father has died."And then I understoodthat asking my father so many questionswas stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking aboutbecause it was painful.And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned,orphaned,my father was making false papers.And if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them.After the liberation he made false papersto allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestinebefore the creation of Israel.And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist,he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.After the Algerian war,at the heart of the international resistance movements,his name circulatedand the whole world came knocking at his door.In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence:Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid party.He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans.There was also Latin America.My father helped those who resisted dictatorshipsin the Dominican Republic, Haiti,and then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua,Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.Then there was the Vietnam War.My father made false papers for the American deserterswho did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese.Europe was not spared either.My father made false papers for the dissidentsagainst Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal,against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece,and even in France.There, just once, it happened in May of 1968.My father watched, benevolently, of course,the demonstrations of the month of May,but his heart was elsewhere, and so was his timebecause he had over 15 countries to serve.Once, though, he agreed to make false papersfor someone you might recognize.(Laughter)He was much younger in those days,and my father agreed to make false papersto enable him to come back and speak at a meeting.He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevantand the least useful he'd had to make in all his life.But, he agreed to do it,even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger,just becauseit was a good opportunityto mock the authorities,and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders --and that ideas have no borders.All my childhood,while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales,my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroeswith unshakeable utopiaswho managed to make miracles.And those heroes did not need an army behind them.Anyhow, nobody would have followed them,except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.I understood much laterthat actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep.I asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make,he ever had any regrets.He said no.He told me that he would have been unableto witness or submit to injustice without doing anything.He was persuaded, and he's still convincedthat another world is possible --a world where no one would ever need a forger.He's still dreaming about it.My fatheris here in the room today.His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up.(Applause)Thank you.

I'm a filmmaker.For the last 8 years,I have dedicated my lifeto documenting the workof Israelis and Palestinianswho are trying to end the conflictusing peaceful means.When I travel with my workacross Europe and the United States,one question always comes up:Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?Why aren't Palestiniansusing nonviolent resistance?The challenge I face when I hear this questionis that often I have just returned from the Middle Eastwhere I spent my timefilming dozens of Palestinianswho are using nonviolenceto defend their landsand water resourcesfrom Israeli soldiers and settlers.These leaders are trying to forgea massive national nonviolent movementto end the occupationand build peace in the region.Yet, most of youhave probably never heard about them.This divide between what's happening on the groundand perceptions abroadis one of the key reasonswhy we don't have yeta Palestinian peaceful resistance movementthat has been successful.So I'm here todayto talk about the power of attention,the power of your attention,and the emergence and developmentof nonviolent movementsin the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere --but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.I believe that what's mostly missingfor nonviolence to growis not for Palestiniansto start adopting nonviolence,but for us to start paying attentionto those who already are.Allow me to illustrate this pointby taking you to this villagecalled Budrus.About seven years ago,they faced extinction,because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier,and part of this barrierwould be built on top of the village.They would lose 40 percent of their landand be surrounded,so they would lose free accessto the rest of the West Bank.Through inspired local leadership,they launched a peaceful resistance campaignto stop that from happening.Let me show you some brief clips,so you have a sensefor what that actually looked like on the ground.(Music)Palestinian Woman: We were told the wallwould separate Palestine from Israel.Here in Budrus,we realized the wall would steal our land.Israeli Man: The fence has, in fact,created a solution to terror.Man: Today you're invitedto a peaceful march.You are joinedby dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the armymore than nonviolent opposition.Woman: We saw the mentrying to push the soldiers,but none of them could do that.But I think the girls could do it.Fatah Party Member: We must empty our mindsof traditional thinking.Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony,and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.Chanting: One united nation.Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.They were allowed to use any force necessary.(Gunshots)Man: These are live bullets.It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protestis not going to stop the [unclear].Protester: This is a peaceful march.There is no need to use violence.Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!We can do it!Julia Bacha: When I first heardabout the story of Budrus,I was surprisedthat the international media had failed to coverthe extraordinary set of eventsthat happened seven years ago,in 2003.What was even more surprisingwas the fact that Budrus was successful.The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance,convinced the Israeli governmentto move the route of the barrier off their landsand to the green line,which is the internationally recognized boundarybetween Israel and the Palestinian Territories.The resistance in Budrushas since spreadto villages across the West Bankand to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.Yet the media remains mostly silenton these stories.This silence carries profound consequencesfor the likelihoodthat nonviolence can grow,or even survive,in Palestine.Violent resistanceand nonviolent resistanceshare one very important thing in common;they are both a form of theaterseeking an audience to their cause.If violent actorsare the only ones constantly getting front-page coversand attracting international attentionto the Palestinian issue,it becomes very hardfor nonviolent leadersto make the case to their communitiesthat civil disobedienceis a viable optionin addressing their plight.The power of attentionis probably going to come as no surpriseto the parents in the room.The surest wayto make your child throw increasingly louder tantrumsis by giving him attentionthe first time he throws a fit.The tantrum will becomewhat childhood psychologists calla functional behavior,since the child has learnedthat he can get parental attention out of it.Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behaviorsimply by giving or withdrawingattention to their children.But that's true for adults too.In fact, the behaviorof entire communities and countriescan be influenced,depending on wherethe international community choosesto focus its attention.I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle Eastand bringing peaceis for usto transform nonviolenceinto a functional behaviorby giving a lot more attentionto the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.In the course of taking my film to villagesin the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem,I have seen the impactthat even one documentary film can havein influencing the transformation.In a village called Wallajeh,which sits very close to Jerusalem,the community was facinga very similar plight to Budrus.They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their landsand not have freedom of access,either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.They had been using nonviolence for about two yearsbut had grown disenchantedsince nobody was paying attention.So we organized a screening.A week later,they held the most well-attendedand disciplineddemonstration to date.The organizers saythat the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrusdocumented in a film,felt that there were indeed peoplefollowing what they were doing,that people cared.So they kept on going.On the Israeli side,there is a new peace movement called Solidariot,which means solidarity in Hebrew.The leaders of this movement have been using Budrusas one of their primary recruiting tools.They reportthat Israelis who had never been active before,upon seeing the film,understand the power of nonviolenceand start joining their activities.The examples of Wallajehand the Solidariot movementshow that even a small-budget independent filmcan play a rolein transforming nonviolenceinto a functional behavior.Now imagine the powerthat big media players could haveif they started coveringthe weekly nonviolent demonstrationshappening in villageslike Bil'in, Ni'lin,Wallajeh,in Jerusalem neighborhoodslike Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan --the nonviolent leaderswould become more visible,valued and effectivein their work.I believethat the most important thingis to understandthat if we don't pay attention to these efforts,they are invisible,and it's as if they never happened.But I have seen first handthat if we do,they will multiply.If they multiply,their influence will growin the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.And theirs is the kind of influencethat can finallyunblock the situation.These leaders have proven that nonviolence worksin places like Budrus.Let's give them attentionso they can prove it works everywhere.Thank you.(Applause)

thandie_newton_embracing_otherness_embracing_myself

Embracing otherness.When I first heard this theme,I thought, well, embracing othernessis embracing myself.And the journey to that placeof understanding and acceptancehas been an interesting one for me,and it's given me an insightinto the whole notion of self,which I think is worth sharing with you today.We each have a self,but I don't think that we're born with one.You know how newborn babiesbelieve they're part of everything;they're not separate?Well that fundamental sense of onenessis lost on us very quickly.It's like that initial stage is over --oneness: infancy,unformed, primitive.It's no longer valid or real.What is real is separateness,and at some point in early babyhood,the idea of selfstarts to form.Our little portion of oneness is given a name,is told all kinds of things about itself,and these details,opinions and ideasbecome facts,which go towards building ourselves,our identity.And that self becomes the vehiclefor navigating our social world.But the self is a projectionbased on other people's projections.Is it who we really are?Or who we really want to be, or should be?So this whole interactionwith self and identitywas a very difficult one for me growing up.The self that I attempted to take out into the worldwas rejected over and over again.And my panicat not having a self that fit,and the confusion that camefrom my self being rejected,created anxiety, shameand hopelessness,which kind of defined me for a long time.But in retrospect,the destruction of my self was so repetitivethat I started to see a pattern.The self changed,got affected, broken, destroyed,but another one would evolve --sometimes stronger,sometimes hateful,sometimes not wanting to be there at all.The self was not constant.And how many timeswould my self have to diebefore I realizedthat it was never alive in the first place?I grew up on the coast of Englandin the '70s.My dad is white from Cornwall,and my mom is black from Zimbabwe.Even the idea of us as a familywas challenging to most people.But nature had its wicked way,and brown babies were born.But from about the age of five,I was aware that I didn't fit.I was the black atheist kidin the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.I was an anomaly,and my self was rooting around for definitionand trying to plug in.Because the self likes to fit,to see itself replicated,to belong.That confirms its existenceand its importance.And it is important.It has an extremely important function.Without it, we literally can't interface with others.We can't hatch plansand climb that stairway of popularity,of success.But my skin color wasn't right.My hair wasn't right.My history wasn't right.My self became definedby otherness,which meant that, in that social world,I didn't really exist.And I was "other" before being anything else --even before being a girl.I was a noticeable nobody.Another world was opening uparound this time:performance and dancing.That nagging dread of self-hooddidn't exist when I was dancing.I'd literally lose myself.And I was a really good dancer.I would putall my emotional expressioninto my dancing.I could be in the movementin a way that I wasn't able to bein my real life, in myself.And at 16,I stumbled across another opportunity,and I earned my first acting role in a film.I can hardly find the wordsto describe the peace I feltwhen I was acting.My dysfunctional selfcould actually plug into another self, not my own,and it felt so good.It was the first time that I existedinside a fully-functioning self --one that I controlled,that I steered,that I gave life to.But the shooting day would end,and I'd returnto my gnarly, awkward self.By 19,I was a fully-fledged movie actor,but still searching for definition.I applied to read anthropologyat university.Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview,and she asked me, "How would you define race?"Well, I thought I had the answer to that one,and I said, "Skin color.""So biology, genetics?" she said."Because, Thandie, that's not accurate.Because there's actually more genetic differencebetween a black Kenyanand a black Ugandanthan there is between a black Kenyanand, say, a white Norwegian.Because we all stem from Africa.So in Africa,there's been more timeto create genetic diversity."In other words,race has no basisin biological or scientific fact.On the one hand, result.Right?On the other hand, my definition of selfjust lost a huge chunk of its credibility.But what was credible,what is biological and scientific fact,is that we all stem from Africa --in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Evewho lived 160,000 years ago.And race is an illegitimate conceptwhich our selves have createdbased on fear and ignorance.Strangely, these revelationsdidn't cure my low self-esteem,that feeling of otherness.My desire to disappearwas still very powerful.I had a degree from Cambridge;I had a thriving career,but my self was a car crash,and I wound up with bulimiaand on a therapist's couch.And of course I did.I still believedmy self was all I was.I still valued self-worthabove all other worth,and what was there to suggest otherwise?We've created entire value systemsand a physical realityto support the worth of self.Look at the industry for self-imageand the jobs it creates,the revenue it turns over.We'd be right in assumingthat the self is an actual living thing.But it's not. It's a projectionwhich our clever brains createin order to cheat ourselvesfrom the reality of death.But there is somethingthat can give the selfultimate and infinite connection --and that thing is oneness,our essence.The self's strugglefor authenticity and definitionwill never endunless it's connected to its creator --to you and to me.And that can happen with awareness --awareness of the reality of onenessand the projection of self-hood.For a start, we can think aboutall the times when we do lose ourselves.It happens when I dance,when I'm acting.I'm earthed in my essence,and my self is suspended.In those moments,I'm connected to everything --the ground, the air,the sounds, the energy from the audience.All my senses are alert and alivein much the same way as an infant might feel --that feeling of oneness.And when I'm acting a role,I inhabit another self,and I give it life for awhile,because when the self is suspendedso is divisivenessand judgment.And I've played everythingfrom a vengeful ghost in the time of slaveryto Secretary of State in 2004.And no matter how otherthese selves might be,they're all related in me.And I honestly believethe key to my success as an actorand my progress as a personhas been the very lack of selfthat used to make me feelso anxious and insecure.I always wonderedwhy I could feel others' pain so deeply,why I could recognizethe somebody in the nobody.It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.I thought I lacked substance,and the fact that I could feel others'meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.The thing that was a source of shamewas actually a source of enlightenment.And when I realizedand really understoodthat my self is a projection and that it has a function,a funny thing happened.I stopped giving it so much authority.I give it its due.I take it to therapy.I've become very familiarwith its dysfunctional behavior.But I'm not ashamed of my self.In fact, I respect my selfand its function.And over time and with practice,I've tried to livemore and more from my essence.And if you can do that,incredible things happen.I was in Congo in February,dancing and celebratingwith women who've survivedthe destruction of their selvesin literally unthinkable ways --destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selvesall over that beautiful landare fueling our selves' addictionto iPods, Pads, and bling,which further disconnect ourselvesfrom ever feeling their pain,their suffering,their death.Because, hey,if we're all living in ourselvesand mistaking it for life,then we're devaluingand desensitizing life.And in that disconnected state,yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows,destroy marine lifeand use rape as a weapon of war.So here's a note to self:The cracks have started to showin our constructed world,and oceans will continueto surge through the cracks,and oil and blood,rivers of it.Crucially, we haven't been figuring outhow to live in onenesswith the Earth and every other living thing.We've just been insanely trying to figure outhow to live with each other -- billions of each other.Only we're not living with each other;our crazy selves are living with each otherand perpetuating an epidemicof disconnection.Let's live with each otherand take it a breath at a time.If we can get under that heavy self,light a torch of awareness,and find our essence,our connection to the infiniteand every other living thing.We knew it from the day we were born.Let's not be freaked outby our bountiful nothingness.It's more a realitythan the ones our selves have created.Imagine what kind of existence we can haveif we honor inevitable death of self,appreciate the privilege of lifeand marvel at what comes next.Simple awareness is where it begins.Thank you for listening.(Applause)

So I'm going to tell you a little bitabout reimagining food.I've been interested in food for a long time.I taught myself to cookwith a bunch of big books like this.I went to chef school in France.And there is a waythe world both envisions food,the way the world writes about food and learns about food.And it's largely what you would find in these books.And it's a wonderful thing.But there's some things that have been going onsince this idea of food was established.In the last 20 years,people have realized that sciencehas a tremendous amount to do with food.In fact, understanding why cooking worksrequires knowing the science of cooking --some of the chemistry, some of the physics and so forth.But that's not in any of those books.There's also a tremendous number of techniquesthat chefs have developed,some about new aesthetics, new approaches to food.There's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria.He's developed a very avant-garde cuisine.A guy in England called Heston Blumenthal,he's developed his avant-garde cuisine.None of the techniques that these people have developedover the course of the last 20 yearsis in any of those books.None of them are taught in cooking schools.In order to learn them, you have to go work in those restaurants.And finally,there's the old way of viewing foodis the old way.And so a few years ago -- fours years ago, actually --I set out to say, is there a waywe can communicate science and technique and wonder?Is there a way we can show people foodin a way they have not seen it before?So we tried, and I'll show you what we came up with.This is a picture called a cutaway.This is actually the first picture I took in the book.The idea here is to explain what happenswhen you steam broccoli.And this magic view allows you to seeall of what's happeningwhile the broccoli steams.Then each of the different little pieces around itexplain some fact.And the hope was two-fold.One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli.But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce peopleinto stuff that was a little more technical,maybe a little bit more scientific, maybe a little bit more chef-ythan they otherwise would have.Because with that beautiful photo,maybe I can also package this little box herethat talks about how steaming and boilingactually take different amounts of time.Steaming ought to be faster.It turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation,and this explains that.Well, that first cutaway picture worked,so we said, "Okay, let's do some more."So here's another one.We discovered why woks are the shape they are.This shaped wok doesn't work very well;this caught fire three times.But we had a philosophy,which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second.(Laughter)And one of our canning cutaways.Once you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away,so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan.And each of these text blocksexplains a key thing that's going on.In this case, boiling water canningis for canning things that are already pretty acidic.You don't have to heat them up as hotas you would something you do pressure canningbecause bacterial spores can't grow in the acid.So this is great for pickled vegetables,which is what we're canning here.Here's our hamburger cutaway.One of our philosophies in the bookis that no dishis really intrinsically any better than any other dish.So you can lavishall the same care, all the same technique,on a hamburgeras you would on some much more fancy dish.And if you do lavish as much technique as possible,and you try to make the highest quality hamburger,it gets to be a little bit involved.The New York Times ran a pieceafter my book was delayedand it was called "The Wait for the 30-Hour HamburgerJust Got Longer."Because our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe,if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff,it does take about 30 hours.Of course, you're not actually working the whole time.Most of the time is kind of sitting there.The point of this cutawayis to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen beforeand to explain the physics of hamburgersand the chemistry of hamburgers,because, believe it or not, there is something to the physics and chemistry --in particular, those flames underneath the burger.Most of the characteristic char-grilled tastedoesn't come from the wood or the charcoal.Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference.Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing, or burning.So it's the fat that drips down and flares upthat causes the characteristic taste.Now you might wonder, how do we make these cutaways?Most people assume we use Photoshop.And the answer is: no, not really;we use a machine shop.And it turns out, the best way to cut things in halfis to actually cut them in half.So we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world.(Laughter)We cut a $5,000 restaurant oven in half.The manufacturer said,"What would it take for you to cut one in half?"I said, "It would have to show up free."And so it showed up, we used it a little while,we cut it in half.Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots.We would glue a piece of Pyrexor heat-resistant glass in front.We used a red, very high-temperature silicon to do that.The great thing is, when you cut something in half,you have another half.So you photograph that in exactly the same position,and then you can substitute in --and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges.So it's very much like in a Hollywood moviewhere a guy flies through the air, supported by wires,and then they take the wires away digitallyso you're flying through the air.In most cases, though, there was no glass.Like for the hamburger, we just cut the damn barbecue.And so those coals that kept falling off the edge,we kept having to put them back up.But again, it only has to work for a thousandth of a second.The wok shot caught fire three times.What happens when you have your wok cut in halfis the oil goes down into the fireand whoosh!One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way.But hey, they grow back.In addition to cutaways,we also explain physics.This is Fourier's law of heat conduction.It's a partial differential equation.We have the only cookbook in the worldthat has partial differential equations in it.But to make them palatable,we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fireand photographed it like this.We've got lots of little tidbits in the book.Everybody knows that your various applianceshave wattage, right?But you probably don't know that much about James Watt.But now you will; we put a biography of James Watt in.It's a little couple paragraphsto explain why we call that unit of heat the watt,and where he got his inspiration.It turned out he was hired by a Scottish distilleryto understand why they were burning so damn much peatto distill the whiskey.We also did a lot of calculation.I personally wrote thousands of lines of codeto write this cookbook.Here's a calculationthat shows how the intensity of a barbecue,or other radiant heat source, goesas you move away from it.So as you move vertically away from this surface,the heat falls off.As you move side to side, it moves off.That horn-shaped regionis what we call the sweet spot.That's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent.So that's the place where you really want to cook.And it's got this funny horn-shaped thing,which as far as I know, again,the first cookbook to ever do this.Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it.You know, there's two waysyou can make a product.You can do lots of market researchand do focus groupsand figure out what people really want,or you can just kind of go for itand make the book you want and hope other people like it.Here's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger.If you really want great hamburger,it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain.And it's really simple, as you can see here.As it comes out of the grinder, you just have a little tray,and you just take it off in little passes,build it up, slice it vertically.Here's the final hamburger.This is the 30-hour hamburger.We make every aspect of this burger.The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it.We also have things about how to make the bun.There's a mushroom, ketchup -- it goes on and on.Now watch closely. This is popcorn. I'll explain it here.The popcorn is illustratinga key thing in physics.Isn't that beautiful?We have a very high-speed camera,which we had lots of fun with on the book.The key physics principle hereis when water boils to steamit expands by a factor of 1,600.That's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn.So it's a great illustration of that.Now I'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual.We have a chapter on gels.And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI,I thought, well, let's put in a recipefor a ballistics gelatin.Well, if you have a high-speed camera,and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around,pretty soon somebody does this.(Gasps)Now the amazing thing hereis that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimicwhat happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that's why you shouldn't get shot.The other amazing thing is, when this ballistics gelatin comes down,it falls back down as a nice block.Anyway, here's the book.Here it is.2,438 pages.And they're nice big pages too.(Applause)A friend of mine complainedthat this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen,so there's a sixth volumethat has washable, waterproof paper.(Applause)

My name is Joshua Walters.I'm a performer.(Beatboxing)(Laughter)(Applause)But as far as being a performer,I'm also diagnosedbipolar.I reframe that as a positivebecause the crazier I get onstage,the more entertaining I become.When I was 16 in San Francisco,I had my breakthrough manic episodein which I thought I was Jesus Christ.Maybe you thought that was scary,but actually there's no amount of drugs you can takethat can get you as highas if you think you're Jesus Christ.(Laughter)I was sent to a place,a psych ward,and in the psych ward,everyone is doing their own one-man show.(Laughter)There's no audience like thisto justify their rehearsal time.They're just practicing.One day they'll get here.Now when I got out,I was diagnosedand I was given medicationsby a psychiatrist."Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some --why don't we give you some Zyprexa.Okay? Mmhmm?At least that's what it says on my pen."(Laughter)Some of you are in the field, I can see.I can feel your noise.The first half of high schoolwas the struggle of the manic episode,and the second halfwas the overmedications of these drugs,where I was sleeping through high school.The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class.When I got outI had a choice.I could either denymy mental illnessor embracemy mental skillness.(Bugle sound)There's a movement going on right nowto reframe mental illness as a positive --at least the hypomanic edge part of it.Now if you don't know what hypomania is,it's like an engine that's out of control,maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks.Many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience,have that creative edge,if you know what I'm talking about.You're driven to do somethingthat everyone has told you is impossible.And there's a book -- John Gartner.John Gartner wrote this book called "The Hypomanic Edge"in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobsand all these business mindshave this edge to compete.A different book was written not too long agoin the mid-90scalled "Touched With Fire" by Kay Redfield Jamisonin which it was looked at in a creative sensein which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Goghall have this manic depression that they were suffering with.Some of them committed suicide.So it wasn't allthe good side of the illness.Now recently,there's been development in this field.And there was an article written in the New York Times,September 2010,that stated:"Just Manic Enough."Just be manic enoughin which investors who are looking for entrepreneursthat have this kind of spectrum --you know what I'm talking about --not maybe full bipolar,but they're in the bipolar spectrum --where on one side,maybe you think you're Jesus,and on the other sidemaybe they just make you a lot of money.(Laughter)Your call. Your call.And everyone's somewhere in the middle.Everyone's somewhere in the middle.So maybe, you know,there's no such thingas crazy,and being diagnosed with a mental illnessdoesn't mean you're crazy.But maybe it just meansyou're more sensitiveto what most people can't seeor feel.Maybe no one's really crazy.Everyone is just a little bit mad.How muchdepends on where you fall in the spectrum.How muchdepends on how lucky you are.Thank you.(Applause)

Space,we all know what it looks like.We've been surrounded by images of spaceour whole lives,from the speculative imagesof science fictionto the inspirational visions of artiststo the increasingly beautiful picturesmade possible by complex technologies.But whilst we havean overwhelmingly vividvisual understanding of space,we have no sense of what space sounds like.And indeed, most people associate space with silence.But the story of howwe came to understand the universeis just as much a story of listeningas it is by looking.And yet despite this,hardly any of us have ever heard space.How many of you herecould describe the soundof a single planet or star?Well in case you've ever wondered,this is what the Sun sounds like.(Static)(Crackling)(Static)(Crackling)This is the planet Jupiter.(Soft crackling)And this is the space probe Cassinipirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn.(Crackling)This is a a highly condensed clumpof neutral matter,spinning in the distant universe.(Tapping)So my artistic practiceis all about listeningto the weird and wonderful noisesemitted by the magnificent celestial objectsthat make up our universe.And you may wonder,how do we know what these sounds are?How can we tell the differencebetween the sound of the Sunand the sound of a pulsar?Well the answeris the science of radio astronomy.Radio astronomersstudy radio waves from spaceusing sensitive antennas and receivers,which give them precise informationabout what an astronomical object isand where it is in our night sky.And just like the signalsthat we send and receive here on Earth,we can convert these transmissions into soundusing simple analog techniques.And therefore, it's through listeningthat we've come to uncoversome of the universe's most important secrets --its scale, what it's made ofand even how old it is.So today, I'm going to tell you a short storyof the history of the universe through listening.It's punctuatedby three quick anecdotes,which show how accidental encounterswith strange noisesgave us some of the most important informationwe have about space.Now this story doesn't startwith vast telescopesor futuristic spacecraft,but a rather more humble technology --and in fact, the very mediumwhich gave us the telecommunications revolutionthat we're all part of today:the telephone.It's 1876, it's in Boston,and this is Alexander Graham Bellwho was working with Thomas Watsonon the invention of the telephone.A key part of their technical set upwas a half-mile long length of wire,which was thrown across the rooftopsof several houses in Boston.The line carried the telephone signalsthat would later make Bell a household name.But like any long length of charged wire,it also inadvertently becamean antenna.Thomas Watsonspent hours listeningto the strange crackles and hissesand chirps and whistlesthat his accidental antenna detected.Now you have to remember,this is 10 years beforeHeinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves --15 years before Nikola Tesla's four-tuned circuit --nearly 20 years before Marconi's first broadcast.So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us.We didn't have the technologyto transmit.So what were these strange noises?Watson was in fact listeningto very low-frequency radio emissionscaused by nature.Some of the crackles and pops were lightning,but the eerie whistlesand curiously melodious chirpshad a rather more exotic origin.Using the very first telephone,Watson was in factdialed into the heavens.As he correctly guessed,some of these sounds were causedby activity on the surface of the Sun.It was a solar windinteracting with our ionospherethat he was listening to --a phenomena which we can seeat the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planetas the aurora.So whilst inventing the technologythat would usher in the telecommunications revolution,Watson had discoveredthat the star at the center of our solar systememitted powerful radio waves.He had accidentally been the first personto tune in to them.Fast-forward 50 years,and Bell and Watson's technologyhas completely transformedglobal communications.But going from slinging some wireacross rooftops in Bostonto laying thousands and thousands of miles of cableon the Atlantic Ocean seabedis no easy matter.And so before long,Bell were looking to new technologiesto optimize their revolution.Radio could carry sound without wires.But the medium is lossy --it's subject to a lot of noise and interference.So Bell employed an engineerto study those noises,to try and find out where they came from,with a view towards buildingthe perfect hardware codec, which would get rid of themso they could think about using radiofor the purposes of telephony.Most of the noisesthat the engineer, Karl Jansky, investigatedwere fairly prosaic in origin.They turned out to be lightningor sources of electrical power.But there was one persistent noisethat Jansky couldn't identify,and it seemed to appearin his radio headsetfour minutes earlier each day.Now any astronomer will tell you,this is the telltale signof something that doesn't originate from Earth.Jansky had made a historic discovery,that celestial objects could emit radio wavesas well as light waves.Fifty years onfrom Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun,Jansky's careful listeningushered in a new age of space exploration:the radio astronomy age.Over the next few years,astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakersand learned about our radio sky,about Jupiter and the Sun,by listening.Let's jump ahead again.It's 1964,and we're back at Bell Labs.And once again,two scientists have got a problem with noise.Arno Penzias and Robert Wilsonwere using the horn antennaat Bell's Holmdel laboratoryto study the Milky Waywith extraordinary precision.They were really listeningto the galaxy in high fidelity.There was a glitch in their soundtrack.A mysterious persistent noisewas disrupting their research.It was in the microwave range,and it appeared to be comingfrom all directions simultaneously.Now this didn't make any sense,and like any reasonable engineer or scientist,they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself,it must be the dish.There were pigeons roosting in the dish.And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings,get the disk kind of operational again,normal operations would resume.But the noise didn't disappear.The mysterious noisethat Penzias and Wilson were listening toturned out to be the oldest and most significant soundthat anyone had ever heard.It was cosmic radiationleft over from the very birth of the universe.This was the first experimental evidencethat the Big Bang existedand the universe was born at a precise momentsome 14.7 billion years ago.So our story endsat the beginning --the beginning of all things, the Big Bang.This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard --the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear,the cosmic microwave background radiationleft over from the Big Bang.(Fuzz)Thanks.(Applause)

(Music)(Applause)Thank you.Imagining a solo cello concert,one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bachunaccompanied cello suites.As a childstudying these eternal masterpieces,Bach's music would interminglewith the singing voices of Muslim prayersfrom the neighboring Arab villageof the northern Kibbutz in Israelwhere I grew up.Late at night, after hours of practicing,I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holidayas the sounds of tango musicwould be creeping from my parents' stereo.It all became music to me.I didn't hear the boundaries.I still start every daypracticing playing Bach.His music never ceasesto sound fresh and surprising to me.But as I was moving awayfrom the traditional classical repertoireand trying to find new waysof musical expression,I realized that with today's technological resources,there's no reason to limitwhat can be produced at one timefrom a single string instrument.The power and coherencythat comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voicesmakes a very different experience.The excitement of a great orchestra performancecomes from the attempt to have a collective of musiciansproducing one unified whole concept.The excitement from using multi-tracking,the way I did in the piece you will hear next,comes from the attemptto build and create a whole universewith many diverse layers,all generated from a single source.My cello and my voice are layeredto create this large sonic canvas.When composers write music for me,I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.I hope to arrive at new territoriesto discover sounds I have never heard before.I want to create endless possibilitieswith this cello.I become the medium through which the music is being channeled,and in the process, when all is right,the music is transformedand so am I.(Music)(Applause)

I'm used to thinking of the TED audienceintelligent, intellectual, savvy,And I think that's true.are actually tying your shoes incorrectly.(Laughter)Now I know that seems ludicrous.I know that seems ludicrous.And what happened to meand I couldn't keep them tied."I love the shoes, but I hate the laces."Now up until that moment,I would have thought that, by age 50,was tying my shoes.(Laughter)But not so -- let me demonstrate.This is the wayNow as it turns out -- thank you.(Applause)Wait, there's more.As it turns out --(Laughter)and we were taught the weak form.And here's how to tell.down the long axis of the shoe.That's the weak form of the knot.But not to worry.If we start overwe get this, the strong form of the knot.And if you pull the cords under the knot,you will see that the bow orients itselfalong the transverse axis of the shoe.This is a stronger knot.It will come untied less often.We're going to do this one more time.(Applause)Start as usual --(Applause)go the other way around the loop.This is a little hard for children,but I think you can handle it.Pull the knot.Now, in keeping with today's theme,(Laughter)Live long and prosper.(Applause)

My journey to become a polar specialist,began when I was four years old,when my family moved from southern CanadaThere we lived with the InuitWe didn't even have a telephone.All of my time was spent outsidewith the Inuit, playing.The snow and the ice were my sandbox,and the Inuit were my teachers.And that's where I becametruly obsessed with this polar realm.and protect it.some images, a cross-section of my work,National Geographic doesn't do this,And what these images are --There are only 200 of these bears left.They're more rare than the panda bear.I thought, my career's over.What in the heck was I thinking?So I had two months to sit therethey publish pictures, not excuses.(Laughter)And after two months of sitting there --one day, thinking that it was all over,this incredible big white male came down,right beside me, three feet away from me,He went through this old-growth forestjust in the forest, and photograph him.Please enjoy.(Music)♫ You're part of the life there ♫♫ You're part of something good ♫♫ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♫♫ What's the purpose? ♫♫ I wonder, who am I? ♫♫ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♫♫ Aah, ah, aah ♫♫ Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh, oh ♫♫ You always end up ♫♫ Not knowing where to go ♫♫ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♫♫ Aah, ah, aah, ah, aah ♫♫ Ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, oh, ah ♫♫ Oh, ah, ah, ah ♫♫ Ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, oh, oh ♫(Applause)My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop.Thank you very much. I appreciate it.We're inundated with news all the timethat the sea ice is disappearingand it's at its lowest level.And what does that mean?You glaze over with it.that, if we lose ice,we stand to lose an entire ecosystem.in the next 50 to 100 years.And there's no better, sexier,for me to hang my campaign on.Polar bears are amazing hunters.There was no ice around.And this bear swam out to that seal --800 lb. bearded seal --grabbed it, swam back and ate it.that, as I approached him --his only defense was to keep eating more seal.And as he ate, he was so full --but it's the ice that's disappearing.we never found dead bears.And in the last four or five years,We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea,These bears are already showing signsof the stress of disappearing ice.Here's a mother and her two year-old cubThey're not going to die of hypothermia.They're going to get to land.are also receding right nowThese little, fat dumplings,150-pound bundles of blubberare the mainstay of the polar bear.associated and connected to sea ice.They give birth inside the ice,And here's a picture of sick ice.and they're grabbing the sun's energyand accelerating the melting process.the ice is moving all over the place.about how we almost died on this dive.that big chunk of ice up in the corner.In that one single piece of ice,you have 300 species of microorganisms.and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed,So really what the ice doesis it acts like a garden.Here's me in my office.I hope you appreciate yours.This is after an hour under the ice.I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen;After an hour in these conditions,it's so extreme that, when I go down,almost every dive I vomit into my regulatorI get to hand my camera to my assistant,Which means, "Take my camera."(Laughter)But it's worth it.the whole world is moving around me --and I thought, "I'm in trouble."the productivity in copepods go down.This is a bowhead whale.Supposedly, science is statingThis whale could have been bornNarwhals, these majestic narwhalsthey could be out on the open water.where they can breathe, catch a breath,And the cod are thereAlright, my favorite part.When I'm on my deathbed,like I did with these leopard seals.They've got those black sinister eyesand those spots on their body.And tragically in [2003],And so people love to form their opinions.And that's when I got a story idea:I want to go to Antarctica,and give them a fair shake --So this is that story.(Laughter)It doesn't work that way.The penguin doesn't know it's cute,This is just the food chain unfolding.They're also big.They're not these little harbor seals.They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.And they're also curiously aggressive.You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac,floating in these icy waters,The boat starts to sink, they race back to the shipAll the leopard seal was doing --it's just biting a balloon.(Laughter)isn't that beautiful --we have finally arrived at Antarctica.I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide.and there's this monstrous leopard seal.(Laughter)and it's flipping it back and forth.so it can eat the meat off the bones,and then it goes off and gets another one.came under the boat, the Zodiac,starting hitting the hull of the boat.And we're trying to not fall in the water."This is a good seal, ya.It's time for you to get in the water."(Laughter)But he was right.And now you've got to deliver.And you can't publish excuses."So I had such dry mouth --probably not as bad as now --but I had such, such dry mouth.I put my snorkel in my mouth,And this was the first thing she did.(Laughter)But I just started to shoot these pictures.She went off, she got a penguin.She stopped about 10 feet away from me,The penguin swims toward me, takes off.And after she did this four or five times,(Laughter)This didn't work.I was laughing so hard and so emotionaljust because it was so amazing.And so that didn't work.sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter)This went on for four days.This just didn't happen a couple of times.so she brought me dead penguins.(Laughter)and I'm just sitting there shooting away.like, "Are you for real?"and I'm not breeding, so ...(Laughter)She's trying to force-feed my camera,which is every photographer's dream.But yet she didn't stop.And on the last day with this femalewhere I thought I had pushed her too far,I got nervous because she came up to me,she rolled over on her back,And I thought, she's about to bite.and she did that to threat display.and brought it to me.(Laughter)and I never once had a scary encounter.and the same with polar bears.And just like the polar bears,I get emotional. Sorry.It's a story that lives deep in my heart,and I'm proud to share this with you.And I'm so passionate about it.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. Thanks very much.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)



carlo_ratti_architecture_that_senses_and_responds

Good afternoon, everybody.I've got something to show you.(Laughter)Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.Let me tell you a bit about it.Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally,and every boy in Italy grows upwith this picture on the wall of his bedroom --but the reason I'm showing you thisis that something very interestinghappened in Formula 1 racingover the past couple of decades.Now some time ago,if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,you take a budget, and you bet your budgeton a good driver and a good car.And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.Now today, if you want to win the race,actually you need also something like this --something that monitors the car in real time,has a few thousand sensorscollecting information from the car,transmitting this information into the system,and then processing itand using it in order to go back to the car with decisionsand changing things in real timeas information is collected.This is what, in engineering terms,you would call a real time control system.And basically, it's a system made of two components --a sensing and an actuating component.What is interesting todayis that real time control systemsare starting to enter into our lives.Our cities, over the past few years,just have been blanketedwith networks, electronics.They're becoming like computers in open air.And, as computers in open air,they're starting to respond in a different wayto be able to be sensed and to be actuated.If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,but they are 50 percent of the world's population.They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.Beyond cities,all of this sensing and actuatingis entering our everyday objects.That's from an exhibition thatPaola Antonelli is organizingat MoMA later this year, during the summer.It's called "Talk to Me."Well our objects, our environmentis starting to talk back to us.In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out therewere becoming both a sensor and an actuator.And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humanswith the environment out there.In a certain sense,it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses --actually you can still see a small chip underneath --and said, shouted,"Perché non parli? Why don't you talk?"Well today, for the first time,our environment is starting to talk back to us.And I'll show just a few examples --again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.Let's starting with sensing.Well, the first project I wanted to share with youis actually one of the first projects by our lab.It was four and a half years ago in Italy.And what we did therewas actually use a new type of network at the timethat had been deployed all across the world --that's a cellphone network --and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network,that's collected anyway by the operator,in order to understandhow the city works.The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006.It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.And anyway, Italy won at the end.(Laughter)Now look at what happened that dayjust by monitoring activityhappening on the network.Here you see the city.You see the Colosseum in the middle,the river Tiber.It's morning, before the match.You see the timeline on the top.Early afternoon,people here and there,making calls and moving.The match begins -- silence.France scores. Italy scores.Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.Second half. End of normal time.First overtime, second.Zidane, the headbutt in a moment.Italy wins. Yeah.(Laughter)(Applause)Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.You saw the big peak.The following day, again everybody went to the centerto meet the winning teamand the prime minister at the time.And then everybody moved down.You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo,where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city todayin a way that we couldn't have donejust a few years ago.Another quick example about sensing:it's not about people,but about things we use and consume.Well today, we know everythingabout where our objects come from.This is a map that shows youall the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.But we know very little about where things go.So in this project,we actually developed some small tagsto track trash as it moves through the system.So we actually started with a number of volunteerswho helped us in Seattle,just over a year ago,to tag what they were throwing away --different types of things, as you can see here --things they would throw away anyway.Then we put a little chip, little tag,onto the trashand then started following it.Here are the results we just obtained.(Music)From Seattle ...after one week.With this information we realizedthere's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.This data was not available before.But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.But the other thing is that we believethat if we see every daythat the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear,it's still somewhere on the planet.And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.And if we show that to people,then we can also promote some behavioral change.So that was the reason for the project.My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman,he could tell you much more about sensingand many other wonderful things we can do with sensing,but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning,and that's actuating our environment.And the first projectis something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.It started with a question by the mayor of the city,who came to us sayingthat Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful traditionof using water in public space, in architecture.And the question was: How could technology, new technology,be added to that?And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshopwas, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,solenoid valves, taps,opening and closing.You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.If those pixels fall,you can write on it,you can show patterns, images, text.And even you can approach it, and it will open upto let you jump through,as you see in this image.Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.He liked it very much.And we got a commission to design a buildingat the entrance of the expo.We called it Digital Water Pavilion.The whole building is made of water.There's no doors or windows,but when you approach it,it will open up to let you in.(Music)The roof also is covered with water.And if there's a bit of wind,if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.Or you could close the building,and the whole architecture will disappear,like in this case.You know, these days, you always get images during the winter,when they take the roof down,of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building."No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,the architecture almost disappears.Here's the building working.You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.And here was myself trying not to get wet,testing the sensors that open the water.Well, I should tell you now what happened one nightwhen all of the sensors stopped working.But actually that night, it was even more fun.All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,because the way of engaging with the building became something different.Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in,but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,and you had to jump without getting wet.(Video) (Crowd Noise)And that was, for us, was very interesting,because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,we always think about how people will use the things we design.But then reality's always unpredictable.And that's the beauty of doing thingsthat are used and interact with people.Here is an image then of the buildingwith the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,and then projections on them.And this is what led us to think aboutthe following project I'll show you now.That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.Imagine you could have small helicoptersthat move in the air,and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights --almost as a cloud that can move in space.Here is the video.(Music)So imagine one helicopter,like the one we saw before,moving with others,in synchrony.So you can have this cloud.You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this --a regular configuration in two dimensions.Or in regular, but in three dimensions,where the thing that changes is the light,not the pixels' position.You can play with a different type.Imagine your screen could just appearin different scales or sizes,different types of resolution.But then the whole thing can bejust a 3D cloud of pixelsthat you can approach and move through itand see from many, many directions.Here is the real Flyfirecontrol and going down to form the regular grid as before.When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.And imagine each of them then controlled by people.You can have each pixelhaving an input that comes from people,from people's movement, or so and so.I want to show you something here for the first time.We've been working with Roberto Bolle,one of today's top ballet dancers --the étoile at Metropolitan in New Yorkand La Scala in Milan --and actually captured his movement in 3Din order to use it as an input for Flyfire.And here you can see Roberto dancing.You see on the left the pixels,the different resolutions being captured.It's both 3D scanning in real timeand motion capture.So you can reconstruct a whole movement.You can go all the way through.But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with themand play with color and movementand gravity and rotation.So we want to use this as one of the possible inputsfor Flyfire.I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.It's something we're working on for the London Olympics.It's called The Cloud.And the idea here is, imagine, again,we can involve peoplein doing something and changing our environment --almost to impart what we call cloud raising --like barn raising, but with a cloud.Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.And I think what is remarkablethat has happened over the past couple of yearsis that, over the past couple of decades,we went from the physical world to the digital one.This has been digitizing everything, knowledge,and making that accessible through the Internet.Now today, for the first time --and the Obama campaign showed us this --we can go from the digital world,from the self-organizing power of networks,to the physical one.This can be, in our case,we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.That means something built in a city.But tomorrow it can be,in order to tackle today's pressing challenges --think about climate change or CO2 emissions --how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.So the idea that we can actually involve peoplein doing this thing together, collectively.The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,in the same way as the real cloudis a cloud made of particles.And those particles are water,where our cloud is a cloud of pixels.It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.You can move inside, have different types of experiences.You can actually see from underneath,sharing the main momentsfor the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,and really using it as a way to connect with the community.So both the physical cloud in the skyand something you can go to the top [of],like London's new mountaintop.You can enter inside it.And a kind of new digital beacon for the night --but most importantly,a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.Thank you.(Applause)

So for the past year and a half,my team at Push Pop Pressand Charlie Melcher and Melcher Mediahave been working on creatingthe first feature-length interactive book.It's called "Our Choice"and the author is Al Gore.It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth,"and it explores all the solutionsthat will solve the climate crisis.The book starts like this. This is the cover.As the globe spins,we can see our location,and we can open the bookand swipe through the chaptersto browse the book.Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.And if we wanted to zoom into a page,we can just open it up.And anything you see in the book,you can pick up with two fingersand lift off the pageand open up.And if you want to go backand read the book again,you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open.(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myselfamong the majoritywho look at windmills and feelthey're a beautiful addition to the landscape.Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book,Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.Zoom into it and see where it was taken.And throughout the book,there's over an hour of documentary footageand interactive animations.So you can open this one.(Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...MM: It starts playing immediately.And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page,and the movie keeps playing.Or we can zoom out to the table of contents,and the video keeps playing.But one of the coolest things in this bookare the interactive infographics.This one shows the wind potentialall around the United States.But instead of just showing us the information,we can take our finger and explore,and see, state by state,exactly how much wind potential there is.We can do the same for geothermal energyand solar power.This is one of my favorites.So this shows ...(Laughter)(Applause)When the wind is blowing,any excess energy coming from the windmillis diverted into the battery.And as the wind starts dying down,any excess energy will be diverted back into the house --the lights never go out.And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.It also runs on the iPhone.And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living roomand then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.And it works the exact same way.You can pinch into any page.Open it up.So that's Push Pop Press' first title,Al Gore's "Our Choice."Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: That's spectacular.Do you want to be a publisher,a technology licenser?What is the business here?Is this something that other people can do?MM: Yeah, we're building a toolthat makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast --and we're on the West coast, building the software --takes our tooland, every day, drags in images and text.CA: So you want to license this software to publishersto make books as beautiful as that? (MM: Yes.)All right. Mike, thanks so much.MM: Thank you. (CA: Good luck.)(Applause)

I wanted to be a rock star.I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.This was in the late '80s.And mostly I wanted to be the fifth memberof Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.They wouldn't have me.I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.And I was certain that's what my life would be.And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegaswhen I was 18,I was stunned to findthat there was not a Pop Star 101,or even a degree program for that interest.And the choir conductor thereknew that I sangand invited me to come and join the choir.And I said, "Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great."And I left the room and said, "No way."The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky,and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people.And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said,"Listen, you've got to join choir.At the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico,all expenses paid.And the soprano section is just full of hot girls."And so I figured for Mexico and babes,I could do just about anything.And I went to my first day in choir,and I sat down with the bassesand sort of looked over my shoulderto see what they were doing.They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat,and boom, they launched into the Kyriefrom the "Requiem" by Mozart.In my entire life I had seen in black and white,and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.The most transformative experience I've ever had --in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmonyand people singing, people together,the shared vision.And I felt for the first time in my lifethat I was part of something bigger than myself.And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.I decided to write a piece for choira couple of years lateras a gift to this conductorwho had changed my life.I had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.And that piece was published,and then I wrote another piece, and that got published.And then I started conducting,and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.And I find myself now in the unlikely positionof standing in front of all of youas a professional classical composer and conductor.Well a couple of years ago,a friend of mine emailed mea link, a YouTube link,and said, "You have got to see this."And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me,singing the soprano lineto a piece of mine called "Sleep."(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.My name is Britlin Losee,and this is a videothat I'd like to make for you.Here's me singing "Sleep."I'm a little nervous, just to let you know.♫ If there are noises ♫♫ in the night ♫Eric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck.Britlin was so innocent and so sweet,and her voice was so pure.And I even loved seeing behind her;I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room.Such an intimate video.And I had this idea: if I could get 50 peopleto all do this same thing,sing their parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass --wherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube,we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.So I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG."I actually wrote, "OMG,"hopefully for the last time in public ever.(Laughter)And I sent out this call to singers.And I made free the download of the musicto a piece that I had written in the year 2000called "Lux Aurumque," which means "light and gold."And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos.Now I should say, before that,what I did is I posted a conductor trackof myself conducting.And it's in complete silence when I filmed it,because I was only hearing the music in my head,imagining the choir that would one day come to be.Afterwards, I played a piano track underneathso that the singers would have something to listen to.And then as the videos started to come in ...(Singing)This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore.(Singing)This is Evangelina Etienne(Singing)from Massachusetts.(Singing)Stephen Hanson from Sweden.(Singing)This is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas.(Singing)There was even a little soprano solo in the piece,and so I had auditions.And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.I was told later,and also by lots of singers who were involved in this,that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takesuntil they got just the right take -- they uploaded it.Here's our winner of the soprano solo.This is Melody Myers from Tennessee.(Singing)I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note --like, "No problem, everything's fine."(Laughter)And from the crowdemerged this young man, Scott Haines.And he said, "Listen, this is the projectI've been looking for my whole life.I'd like to be the person to edit this all together."I said, "Thank you, Scott. I'm so glad that you found me."And Scott aggregated all of the videos.He scrubbed the audio.He made sure that everything lined up.And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir.(Singing)I'll stop it there in the interest of time.(Applause)Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.So there's more. There's more.Thank you so much.And I had the same reaction you did.I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it.I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it --these souls all on their own desert island,sending electronic messages in bottles to each other.And the video went viral.We had a million hits in the first monthand got a lot of attention for it.And because of that, then a lot of singers started saying,"All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?"And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing,"Sleep," which is another workthat I wrote in the year 2000 --poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri.And again, I posted a conductor video,and we started accepting submissions.This time we got some more mature members.(Singing)And some younger members.(Video) Soprano: ♫ Upon my pillow ♫♫ Safe in bed ♫EW: That's Georgie from England. She's only nine.Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen?Someone did all eight videos --a bass even singing the soprano parts.This is Beau Awtin.(Video) Beau Awtin: ♫ Safe in bed ♫EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal --there was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop"and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody.And there were 900 people involved in that.So I told the singers, "That's our goal.That's the number for us to beat."And we just closed submissions January 10th,and our final tally was 2,051 videosfrom 58 different countries.Thank you.(Applause)From Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam,Jordan, Egypt, Israel,as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand.And we also put a page on Facebookfor the singers to upload their testimonials,what it was like for them, their experience singing it.And I've just chosen a few of them here."My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly.Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling.It's so wonderful to sing together again!"I love the idea that she's singing with her sister."Aside from the beautiful music,it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before,but who are connected anyway."And my personal favorite,"When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this,he told me that I did not have the voice for it."Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too.Me too."It hurt so much, and I shed some tears,but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words.It is a dream come true to be part of this choir,as I've never been part of one.When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map,I had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live.As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush,satellite is my connection to the world."So two things struck me deeply about this.The first is that human beingswill go to any lengths necessaryto find and connect with each other.It doesn't matter the technology.And the second isthat people seem to be experiencing an actual connection.It wasn't a virtual choir.There are people now online that are friends; they've never met.But, I know myself too, I feelthis virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them.I feel a closeness to this choir --almost like a family.What I'd like to close with then todayis the first lookat "Sleep" by Virtual Choir 2.0.This will be a premiere today.We're not finished with the video yet.You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos,the render time is just atrocious.But we do have the first three minutes.And it's a tremendous honorfor me to be able to show it to you here first.You're the very first people to see this.This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir.(Video) Virtual Choir: ♫ The evening hangs ♫♫ beneath the moon ♫♫ A silver thread on darkened dune ♫♫ With closing eyes and resting head ♫♫ I know that sleep is coming soon ♫♫ Upon my pillow, ♫♫ safe in bed, ♫♫ a thousand pictures fill my head ♫♫ I cannot sleep ♫♫ my mind's aflight ♫♫ and yet my limbs seem made of lead ♫♫ If there are noises in the night ♫Eric Whitacre: Thank you very, very much. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)



handpring_puppet_co_the_genius_puppetry_behind_war_horse

Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here todayto talk about the evolution of a puppet horse.Basil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolutionwith a hyena.AK: The ancestor of the horse.Okay, we'll do something with it.(Laughter)Hahahaha.The hyena is the ancestor of the horsebecause it was part of a productioncalled "Faustus in Africa,"a Handspring Production from 1995,where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.This production was directedby South African artist and theater director,William Kentridge.So it needed a very articulate front paw.But, like all puppets, it has other attributes.BJ: One of them is breath,and it kind of breathes.AK: Haa haa haaa.BJ: Breath is really important for us.It's the kind of original movementfor any puppet for us onstage.It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet --AK: Oops.BJ: From an actor.Puppets always have to try to be alive.It's their kind of ur-story onstage,that desperation to live.AK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see,and it only livesbecause you make it.An actor struggles to die onstage,but a puppet has to struggle to live.And in a way that's a metaphor for life.BJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.So we call thisa piece of emotional engineeringthat uses up-to-the-minute17th century technology --(Laughter)to turn nounsinto verbs.AK: Well actually I prefer to saythat it's an objectconstructed out of wood and clothwith movement built into itto persuade you to believe that it has life.BJ: Okay so.AK: It has ears that move passivelywhen the head goes.BJ: And it has these bulkheadsmade out of plywood,covered with fabric --curiously similar, in fact,to the plywood canoesthat Adrian's father used to makewhen he was a boy in their workshop.AK: In Port Elizabeth, the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa.BJ: His mother was a puppeteer.And when we met at art schooland fell in lovein 1971,I hated puppets.I really thought they were so beneath me.I wanted to become an avant-garde artist --and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go.And, in fact, it took about 10 yearsto discoverthe Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa,where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry,to learn a renewed, or a new, respectfor this art form.AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mineto form a puppet company.And 20 years later, miraculously,we collaborated with a company from Mali,the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako,where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe.BJ: And here again, you see the same structure.The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane,but it's ultimately the same structure.It's got two people inside it on stilts,which give them the height,and somebody in the frontwho's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head.AK: The person in the hind legsis also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena --same mechanism, just a bit bigger.And he's controlling the ear movement.BJ: So this productionwas seen by Tom Morrisof the National Theatre in London.And just around that time,his mother had said,"Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgocalled 'War Horse'?"AK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse.The horse is sold to the First World War,and he joins up to find his horse.BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said,"Do you think you could make us a horsefor a show to happen at the National Theatre?"AK: It seemed a lovely idea.BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.AK: It had to have a rider,and it had to participate in cavalry charges.(Laughter)A play about early 20th century plowing technologyand cavalry chargeswas a little bit of a challenge for the accounting departmentat the National Theatre in London.But they agreed to go along with it for a while.So we began with a test.BJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander,who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse,and our next-door neighbor Katherine,riding on a ladder.The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.AK: And once we put Katherinethrough that particular brand of hell,we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.So we made a model.This is a cardboard model,a little bit smaller than the hyena.You'll notice that the legs are plywood legsand the canoe structure is still there.BJ: And the two manipulators are inside.But we didn't realize at the timethat we actually needed a third manipulator,because we couldn't manipulate the neckfrom insideand walk the horse at the same time.AK: We started work on the prototypeafter the model was approved,and the prototype took a bit longerthan we anticipated.We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.And we had a crate built for it.It had to be shipped to London.We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town,and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet.BJ: So we got a camera,and we posed the puppetin various galloping stances.And we sent it offto the National Theatre,hoping that they believedthat we created something that worked.(Laughter)AK: A month later, we were there in Londonwith this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.BJ: About 40 people.AK: We were terrified.We opened the lid, we took the horse out,and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.Here I have an 18-second clipof the very first walk of the prototype.This is in the National Theatre studio,the place where they cook new ideas.It had by no means got the green light yet.The choreographer, Toby Sedgwick,invented a beautiful sequencewhere the baby horse,which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs,grew up into the big horse.And Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre,saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself.And so the show was given the green light.And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely.Here is the plan.(Laughter)And here is our factory in Cape Townwhere we make horses.You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.The horses are completely handmade.There is very little 20th century technology in them.We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywoodand some of the aluminum pieces.But because they have to be light and flexible,and each one of them is different,they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.So here are some half-finished horsesready to be worked in London.And now we would like to introduce youto Joey.Joey boy, you there?Joey.(Applause)(Applause)Joey.Joey, come here.No, no, I haven't got it.He's got it; it's in his pocket.BJ: Joey.AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.Come here. Stand here where people can see you.Move around. Come on.I'd just like to describe --I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated.Here, Craig is working the head.He has bicycle brake cablesgoing down to the head control in his hand.Each one of themoperates either an ear, separately,or the head, up and down.But he also controls the head directlyby using his hand.The ears are obviouslya very important emotional indicator of the horse.When they point right back,the horse is fearful or angry,depending upon what's going on in front of him, around him.Or, when he's more relaxed, the head comes downand the ears listen, either side.Horses' hearing is very important.It's almost more important than their eyesight.Over here,Tommy's got what you call the heart position.He's working the leg.You see the string tendon from the hyena,the hyena's front leg,automatically pulls the hoop up.(Laughter)Horses are so unpredictable.(Laughter)The way a hoof comes up with a horseimmediately gives you the feelingthat it's a convincing horse action.The hind legs have got the same action.BJ: And Mikey also has,in his fingers,the ability to move the tailfrom left to right,and up and down with the other hand.And together, there's quite a complex possibilityof tail expression.AK: You want to say something about the breathing?BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.Adrian thoughtthat he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in twoand make it breathe like that --because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.But we realizedthat, if that were to be happening,you wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.So he made a channel in here,and the chest moves up and down in that channel.So it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement,but it feels like breath.And it's very, very simplebecause all that happensis that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.AK: Other emotional stuff.If I were to touch the horse hereon his skin,the heart puppeteer can shake the body from insideand get the skin to quiver.You'll notice, of course,that the puppet is made out of cane lines.And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice,that I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horsethat somehow moves in space.But of course, it was the cane is light,the cane is flexible, the cane is durableand the cane is moldable.And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane.The skin itselfis made out of a see-through nylon mesh,which, if the lighting designerwants the horse to almost disappear,she can light the backgroundand the horse becomes ghostlike.You see the skeletal structure of it.Or if you light it from above, it becomes more solid.Again, that was a practical consideration.The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out.They have to be able to actalong with their fellow actors in the production.And it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.It's three heads making one character.But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces.And plant.(Whinny)Thank you.And now just --(Applause)All the way from sunny Californiawe have Zem Joaquinwho's going to ride the horse for us.(Applause)(Applause)(Music)So we would like to stressthat the performance you see in the horseis three guyswho have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly.BJ: Not being able to talk to one anotherwhile they're onstagebecause they're mic'd.The sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse --the whinnying and the nickering and everything --that starts usually with one performer,carries on with a second personand ends with a third.AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.(Applause)Mikey Brett, Craig, Leo,Zem Joaquin and Basil and me.(Applause)Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)

(Singing)(Singing ends)(Applause)She is a world-class soprano singerwho studied in Rochester, New York.winning praise for her brilliance,and her vivid stage personality.Please welcome Claron McFadden.(Applause)Claron McFadden: The human voice:mysterious, spontaneous, primal.except, perhaps, jealousy.And the breath,the breath is the captain of that vessel.A child is born,takes its first breath --(Inhales)Whah!And we behold the wondrous beautyof vocal expression --mysterious, spontaneousand primal.I wanted a placeI spent two weeks at this retreatin my own little hut --no music, no nothing -- sounds of nature,being in the moment.On my last day,the woman who looked after the place,she came and we spoke for a minute,and then she said to me,"Would you sing something for me?"I can't make noise.She said, "Please, sing for me."So I closed my eyes,I took breathand the first thing that came up and outwas "Summertime,"Porgy and Bess.Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high.So hush little baby,don't you cry.And I opened my eyes,and I saw that she had her eyes closed.And after a moment, she opened her eyesand she looked at me and she said,"It's like meditation."And in that moment I understoodto search for,I had it already in my singing --the calm, but alertness,the focus, but awareness,and being totally in the moment.When you're totally in the moment --when I'm totally in the moment,the vessel of expression is open.The emotions can flow from meto youand back.It's an extremely profound experience.There's a piece by a composer,an American composer called John Cage.It's called "Aria."if you see it behind me --it's not notated in any way.No notes, no flats, no sharps.But it's a kind of structure.And the singer, within this structure,For example,there are different colorspop, country and western, opera, jazz --You see there are different lines.to follow the line,but you must respect it,more or less.And these little dots,these represent a sort of soundthat's not a vocal, not a lyrical wayof expressing the voice.Using the body -- it could be sneezing,it could be coughing, animals --(Audience member coughs)Exactly. (Laughter)Clapping, whatever.And there's different text.So within this structure, one is free.To me, this piece is an ode to the voice,because it's mysterious, as we can see.It's quite spontaneous.And it's primal.It's "Aria," of John Cage.(Singing in various languages)Hampart-zoumDirouhiDi questa TerraNaprasnoConscience et(Barks)(Singing) AriseTsk, tsk, tsk.(Singing)Vidiel’afacilmenteE io sono per te(Robotic voice) No other wayDans l'espace, so help(Singing)Si justeDvidzénya bistri(Claps)(Singing)On pekrásenidyot a k uO a k ho aSivayoot eternal loosin(Sneezes)(Laughs)Shh!(Singing)Gloobinoí più chiaraSi ceci est cela cela est ceciTotalmente soi whom they sought to slayTo have the fruits gloireJ’écoute ...À la vie…Leggermente snédznoiCoo cooP k t dBanalitéK o e(Makes the sound of a kiss)(Singing)In armonia(Applause)

If I should have a daughter,instead of "Mom,"she's going to call me "Point B,"so she has to learn the entire universeAnd she's going to learnBut getting the wind knocked out of youis the only way to remind your lungshow much they like the taste of air.There is hurt, here,I'll make sure she knowsyour hands will always be too smallto catch all the pain you want to heal.Believe me, I've tried."And, baby," I'll tell her,You're just smelling for smoketo see if you can save him.to see if you can change him.But I know she will anyway,of chocolate and rain boots nearby,But that's what the rain boots are for,I want her to look at the worldto look through a microscopeat the galaxies that existon the pinpoint of a human mind,because that's the way my mom taught me.That there'll be days like this.When you open your hands to catchand the very people you want to saveare the ones standing on your cape;when your boots will fill with rain,Because there's nothing more beautifulno matter how many times it's sent away.be sure your mind landsI am pretty damn naive.It can crumble so easily,and your poppa is a warrior,who never stops asking for more."Remember that good things come in threesand so do bad things.but don't you ever apologizeAnd when they finally hand you heartache,and offer you handouts on street-cornersof cynicism and defeat,(Applause)Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thanks.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)All right, so I want you to take a moment,They can be about whatever you want --technology, entertainment, design,your family, what you had for breakfast.The only rule is don't think too hard.Okay, ready? Go.Okay.although not necessarily in that order."(Laughter)And I know(Laughter)Why was the scarecrow invited to TED?Because he was out standing in his field.(Laughter)I'm sorry.So I write poems to figure things out.is by writing a poem.Sometimes I get to the end of the poem,and sometimes I get to the end of the poemand haven't solved anything,but at least I have a new poem out of it.I tell people it involves creating poetrythat doesn't just want to sit on paper,or witnessed in person.When I was a freshman in high school,I was a live wire of nervous hormones.And despite my fearof ever being looked at for too long,had come together, had a baby,a baby I needed to get to know.So I decided to give it a try.My first spoken-word poem,was about the injusticeof being seen as unfeminine.The poem was very indignant,and mainly exaggerated,was mainly indignant,The first time that I performed,I felt this tap on my shoulder,and I turned around to seeShe was maybe eight feet tall"Hey, I really felt that. Thanks."And lightning struck.I was hooked.that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic,I was the youngest by at least a decade,In fact, they welcomed me.it could be fun or painfulor serious or silly.and the poets who performedencouraged me to share my stories as well.Never mind the fact that I was 14.They told me, "Write about being 14."So I did and stood amazed every weekwhen these brilliant, grown-up poetslaughed with me and groaned their sympathyNow I can divide my spoken-word journeyinto three steps.Step one was the moment I said,"I can. I can do this."And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.Step two was the moment I said,"I will. I will continue.And step three beganif that's not what I was.the weirder my poetry got,but the more that it felt like mine.you've collected up to nowbut I show up to each new poemAnd actually, Phil Kaye and Ithis time changing the missioneducate and inspire.performing and teachingnine-year-olds to MFA candidates,from California to Indiana to IndiaAnd we saw over and overthe way that spoken-word poetrycracks open locks.Turns out sometimes,And the first list that I assignis "10 Things I Know to be True."or one thing very similar,to something on your list.And then someone elsethese four intersectionsof what you're passionate aboutand what others might be invested in.was not convinced.I don't have anything interesting to say."So I assigned her list after list,and one day I assigned the list"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now."Number three on Charlotte's list was,three times my age."I asked her what that meant,And so she wrote her first poem,And the poem began,"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man."(Laughter)"Did you see him on 60 Minutes,racing Michael Phelps in a pool --nothing but swim trunks on --and said, 'You're a god.'No, Anderson, you're the god."(Laughter)(Applause)is to seem unfazed,to never admit that anything scares youor impresses you or excites you.Somebody once told meit's like walking through life like this.You protect yourselfBut I try to walk through life like this.just fall out of the sky,I'm ready to catch them.I use spoken word to help my studentsrediscover wonder,is the ideal art form.But I teach spoken-word poetrybecause it's accessible.but everyone can communicate in some way,or that nobody understands you,but spoken word teachesyou could be rewardedwith a room full of your peers,or your community, who will listen.And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodiewho will connect with what you've shared.especially when you're 14.Plus, now with YouTube,that I can share with my students.It allows for even more opportunitiesOnce you've figured this out,You have to grow and exploreand take risks and challenge yourself.And that is step three:infusing the work you're doingBecause step three never ends.But you don't get to start on step three,until you take step one first:"I can."I travel a lot while I'm teaching,but I was very lucky with Charlotte,I watched her realizelike this story.and I wondered if the best wayIn preparing for TED,It's clear that when I was a child,I think that we all did.to want to share what they've learned,what they've figured out to be trueand what they're still figuring out.So I'd like to close with this poem.When they bombed Hiroshima,the explosion formed a mini-supernova,so every living animal, human or plantwas instantly turned to ash.caused an entire city and its populationto turn into powder.She says I have old eyes."Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby."I still haven't figured anything out yet.My self-confidence can be measured outin teaspoons mixed into my poetry,leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.I keep trying,hoping that one day I'll write a poemas the only proof I existed.she laughed,because the first Sarah,And me?Well, neither do I,but I see the impossible every day.knowing that while you're speaking,They feel exactly what you feelat the same time that you feel it.that impossible connection.There's this piece of wall in Hiroshimablocked the rays from hitting the stone.The only thing left nowis a permanent shadow of positive light.After the A-bomb,specialists said it would take 75 yearsto ever grow anything again.When I meet you, in that moment,I'm no longer a part of your future.And you, you get to share mine.And that is the greatest present of all.I'll probably laugh at you.because I don't know that much about it --but if you make me laugh hard enough,sometimes I forget what century I'm in.These aren't the last words I'll share.But just in case, I'm trying my hardestto get it right this time around.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)

cynthia_breazeal_the_rise_of_personal_robots
1028644

Ever since I was a little girlseeing "Star Wars" for the first time,I've been fascinated by this ideaof personal robots.And as a little girl,I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with usmuch more like a helpful, trusted sidekick --something that would delight us, enrich our livesand help us save a galaxy or two.I knew robots like that didn't really exist,but I knew I wanted to build them.So 20 years pass --I am now a graduate student at MITstudying artificial intelligence,the year is 1997,and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars.But robots are still not in our home, ironically.And I remember thinking aboutall the reasons why that was the case.But one really struck me.Robotics had really been about interacting with things,not with people --certainly not in a social way that would be natural for usand would really help people accept robotsinto our daily lives.For me, that was the white space; that's what robots could not do yet.And so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet,the world's first social robot.Three years later --a lot of programming,working with other graduate students in the lab --Kismet was ready to start interacting with people.(Video) Scientist: I want to show you something.Kismet: (Nonsense)Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me.Kismet: (Nonsense)Scientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too.I almost lost it this week.Cynthia Breazeal: So Kismet interacted with peoplelike kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child,which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind.It didn't speak language, but it didn't matter.This little robot was somehow ableto tap into something deeply social within us --and with that, the promise of an entirely new waywe could interact with robots.So over the past several yearsI've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots,now at the media labwith my own team of incredibly talented students.And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo.We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio.And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo.This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo,introducing Leo to a new object.And because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it.But sort of like us, he can actually learn about itfrom watching Matt's reaction.(Video) Matt Berlin: Hello, Leo.Leo, this is Cookie Monster.Can you find Cookie Monster?Leo, Cookie Monster is very bad.He's very bad, Leo.Cookie Monster is very, very bad.He's a scary monster.He wants to get your cookies.(Laughter)CB: All right, so Leo and Cookiemight have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start,but they get along great now.So what I've learnedthrough building these systemsis that robots are actuallya really intriguing social technology,where it's actually their abilityto push our social buttonsand to interact with us like a partnerthat is a core part of their functionality.And with that shift in thinking, we can now start to imaginenew questions, new possibilities for robotsthat we might not have thought about otherwise.But what do I mean when I say "push our social buttons?"Well, one of the things that we've learnedis that, if we design these robots to communicate with ususing the same body language,the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use --like Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here --what we find is that people respond to robotsa lot like they respond to people.People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is,how likable, how engaging,how trustworthy.It turns out it's the same for robots.It's turning out nowthat robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific toolto understand human behavior.To answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter,we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is?Mimicry's believed to play a role, but how?Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters?It turns out it's really hardto learn this or understand this from watching peoplebecause when we interact we do all of these cues automatically.We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us.But with the robot, you can.And so in this video here --this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University.He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with.There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cuesto be able to study this question.And the bottom line is -- the reason why this works isbecause it turns out people just behave like peopleeven when interacting with a robot.So given that key insight,we can now start to imaginenew kinds of applications for robots.For instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues,maybe they would be a cool, new communication technology.So imagine this:What about a robot accessory for your cellphone?You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot,and, bam! You're a MeBot --you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends,you can move around, you can gesture --maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?To explore this question,my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a studywhere we brought human participants, people, into our labto do a collaborative taskwith a remote collaborator.The task involved thingslike looking at a set of objects on the table,discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task --this ended up being a survival task --and then rating them in termsof how valuable and important they thought they were.The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our groupwho used one of three different technologiesto interact with the participants.The first was just the screen.This is just like video conferencing today.The next was to add mobility -- so, have the screen on a mobile base.This is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today --this is mirroring that situation.And then the fully expressive MeBot.So after the interaction,we asked people to rate their quality of interactionwith the technology, with a remote collaboratorthrough this technology, in a number of different ways.We looked at psychological involvement --how much empathy did you feel for the other person?We looked at overall engagement.We looked at their desire to cooperate.And this is what we see when they use just the screen.It turns out, when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table --you get a little more of a boost.And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression.So it seems like this physical, social embodimentactually really makes a difference.Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context.Today we know that families are living further and further apart,and that definitely takes a toll on family relationshipsand family bonds over distance.For me, I have three young boys,and I want them to have a really good relationshipwith their grandparents.But my parents live thousands of miles away,so they just don't get to see each other that often.We try Skype, we try phone calls,but my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk;they want to play.So I love the idea of thinking about robotsas a new kind of distance-play technology.I imagine a time not too far from now --my mom can go to her computer,open up a browser and jack into a little robot.And as grandma-bot,she can now play, really play,with my sons, with her grandsons,in the real world with his real toys.I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-playswith their granddaughters, with their friends,and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house,like sharing a bedtime story.And through this technology,being able to be an active participantin their grandchildren's livesin a way that's not possible today.Let's think about some other domains,like maybe health.So in the United States today,over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese,and now it's a big problem with our children as well.And we know that as you get older in life,if you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseasesthat not only reduce your quality of life,but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system.But if robots can be engaging,if we like to cooperate with robots,if robots are persuasive,maybe a robot can help youmaintain a diet and exercise program,maybe they can help you manage your weight.Sort of like a digital Jiminy --as in the well-known fairy tale --a kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always thereto be able to help you make the right decisionin the right way at the right timeto help you form healthy habits.So we actually explored this idea in our lab.This is a robot, Autom.Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.It could make eye contact with you.It could share information looking down at a screen.You'd use a screen interface to enter information,like how many calories you ate that day,how much exercise you got.And then it could help track that for you.And the robot spoke with a synthetic voiceto engage you in a coaching dialoguemodeled after trainersand patients and so forth.And it would build a working alliance with youthrough that dialogue.It could help you set goals and track your progress,and it would help motivate you.So an interesting question is,does the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot?Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters?To explore that question,we did a study in the Boston areawhere we put one of three interventions in people's homesfor a period of several weeks.One case was the robot you saw there, Autom.Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface,ran exactly the same dialogues.The quality of advice was identical.And the third was just a pen and paper log,because that's the standard intervention you typically getwhen you start a diet-and-exercise program.So one of the things we really wanted to look atwas not how much weight people lost,but really how long they interacted with the robot.Because the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off.And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions,well that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success.So the first thing I want to look at is how long,how long did people interact with these systems.It turns out that people interacted with the robotsignificantly more,even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer.When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance,people rated the robot higherand they trusted the robot more.(Laughter)And when you look at emotional engagement,it was completely different.People would name the robots.They would dress the robots.(Laughter)And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study,they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots.They didn't do this with a computer.The last thing I want to talk about todayis the future of children's media.We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today,whether it's television or computer games or whatnot.My sons, they love the screen. They love the screen.But I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play,like, real-world play.And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you todaycalled Playtime Computingthat's really trying to think about how we can takewhat's so engaging about digital mediaand literally bring it off the screeninto the real world of the child,where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play.So here's the first exploration of this idea,where characters can be physical or virtual,and where the digital contentcan literally come off the screeninto the world and back.I like to think of thisas the Atari Pongof this blended-reality play.But we can push this idea further.What if --(Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay!CB: -- the character itself could come into your world?It turns out that kids love itwhen the character becomes real and enters into their world.And when it's in their world,they can relate to it and play with it in a waythat's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.Another important idea is this notionof persistence of character across realities.So changes that children make in the real worldneed to translate to the virtual world.So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.You can imagine maybe these symbolsgive the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world.So they are now sending the character back into that world.And now it's got number power.And then finally, what I've been trying to do hereis create a really immersive experience for kids,where they really feel like they are part of that story,a part of that experience.And I really want to spark their imaginationsthe way mine was sparked as a little girl watching "Star Wars."But I want to do more than that.I actually want them to create those experiences.I want them to be able to literally build their imaginationinto these experiences and make them their own.So we've been exploring a lot of ideasin telepresence and mixed realityto literally allow kids to project their ideas into this spacewhere other kids can interact with themand build upon them.I really want to come up with new ways of children's mediathat foster creativity and learning and innovation.I think that's very, very important.So this is a new project.We've invited a lot of kids into this space,and they think it's pretty cool.But I can tell you, the thing that they love the mostis the robot.What they care about is the robot.Robots touch something deeply human within us.And so whether they're helping usto become creative and innovative,or whether they're helping usto feel more deeply connected despite distance,or whether they are our trusted sidekickwho's helping us attain our personal goalsin becoming our highest and best selves,for me, robots are all about people.Thank you.(Applause)

She's 37 years old.and a few months previously,she had almost died in childbirth.but she decided she'd go for brokethe New York City Marathon.including the Olympic gold medalist,and Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster,Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable.That's her competition.she's, like, under the underdogs.But the under-underdog hangs tough,and 22 miles into a 26-mile race,from Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands,and blaze for the finish line.Derartu Tulu ruins the script.Instead of taking off,She catches up with the lead packand is pushing toward the finish line.But then she falls back again.She loses the check,Wins the New York City Marathon,goes home with a big fat check.It's a heartwarming story,but if you drill a little bit deeper,it's not a coincidence.somehow water's involved.down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico,Number one is:The Mayans and Aztecs engaged,The Tarahumara had a different strategy.They took off and hidcalled the Copper Canyons.deep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old --these guys aren't running marathons;they're running mega-marathons.They're not doing 26 miles,they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time,and brain power to solve --So what's the connection?Again, we're talking about outliers;what the Tarahumara have known forever.because nobody else knows the answer.Mystery number one is this:To have a brain of that size,no argument, that's a fact.The only problem is,So somehow, for nearly two million years,Now, we're not using our strength,We think Usain Bolt is fast.We're not fast.That would be an Olympic event:(Laughter)Mystery number two:they all suck; they're terrible.who can run faster than 4:15.But --(Laughter)if you tried to run 26 miles?Audience Member: Her uterus would be torn.Torn reproductive organs.(Laughter)Now, I've been to a lot of marathons,and I've yet to see any ...(Laughter)So it's only been 20 yearsand it's a coin toss who's going to win.I'll give you an example.called the Hardrock 100,Well, Emily Baer -- 500 runners --to breastfeed her baby during the race.(Laughter)And yet, she beat 492 other people.The last mystery:The third mystery is this:for people running the marathon.until you reach your peak at age 27.And you'll get slower and slower,and then gradually you fall off your peak,until you go back to the starting point.maybe 10 years -- no, it's 45 years.64-year-old men and women(Laughter)So you have these three mysteries.and get away with it.But I'll submit this to you:and don't die of heart disease,perhaps it's because humans,Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal.the only thing we do really well is sweat.we're superb -- the best on the planet.You take a horse on a hot day,But it ain't doing both. We can.That's all we could do.We could run really far on a hot day.You need a pack to pull together.who have been doing this for a long timeThey can't be 10 miles behind.They need to be part of the pack.ready to drop the kill,The pack stays together.You can't be a pissed-off pack.be cooperative, and pull together.What you end up with, in other words,It's a really compelling argumentfor two million years,But maybe it's something different.and we spoiled it.We try to cash in on it. Right?and then sell it to people.called running shoes.And I think if anybody in here runs --I just had a conversation with Carol.the conversation turns to injury.then why are we so bad at it?Why do we keep getting hurt?If you read folklore and mythology,any kind of myths, any kind of tall tales,and youthfulness and eternal vigor.with fear and pain.across the desert,and slap leather for home.I've got to take this week off."(Laughter)Humans ran and ran all the time.All of our science comes from the factto run long distances.So how do we get back to that again?Get rid of all the stinking running shoes.Stop focusing on urban marathons,which, if you do four hours, you suck,and if you do 3:59:59, you're awesome,because you qualified for another race.and, I would say, nakedness,that has made the TarahumaraSo what's the benefit? So what?Without getting too extreme about this,and engage in the kind of exercisemore healthy,burn off stress --and what the Tarahumara have always been.but maybe there's somewhere in between.And if we find that thing,up until the 1970s or so,could be astounding.And what they have found uniformly is,for a very long time:that this can be a whole lot of fun.I've experienced it personally myself.I appreciate your listening to this story.Thanks very much.(Applause)



johanna_blakley_social_media_and_the_end_of_gender
1200438

I'm going to make an argument todaythat may seem a little bit crazy:social media and the end of gender.Let me connect the dots.I'm going to argue todaythat the social media applicationsthat we all know and love, or love to hate,are actually going to help free usfrom some of the absurd assumptionsthat we have as a society about gender.I think that social mediais actually going to help us dismantlesome of the silly and demeaning stereotypesthat we see in media and advertisingabout gender.If you hadn't noticed,our media climate generally providesa very distorted mirrorof our lives and of our gender,and I think that's going to change.Now most media companies --television, radio, publishing, games, you name it --they use very rigid segmentation methodsin order to understand their audiences.It's old-school demographics.They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us.Now the crazy thingis that media companies believethat if you fall within a certain demographic categorythen you are predictable in certain ways --you have certain taste,that you like certain things.And so the bizarre result of thisis that most of our popular cultureis actually based on these presumptionsabout our demographics.Age demographics:the 18 to 49 demohas had a huge impacton all mass media programming in this countrysince the 1960s,when the baby boomers were still young.Now they've aged out of that demographic,but it's still the casethat powerful ratings companies like Nielsondon't even take into accountviewers of television shows over age 54.In our media environment,it's as if they don't even exist.Now, if you watch "Mad Men," like I do --it's a popular TV show in the States --Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics,which first came about in the 1960s,where you create these complex psychological profilesof consumers.But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business.It's really just been basic demographics.So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC,and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight yearson demographicsand how they affect media and entertainmentin this country and abroad.And in the last three years,we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed,and we've discovered some very interesting things.All the people who participate in social media networksbelong to the same old demographic categoriesthat media companies and advertisershave used in order to understand them.But those categories mean even less nowthan they did before,because with online networking tools,it's much easier for usto escape some of our demographic boxes.We're able to connect with people quite freelyand to redefine ourselves online.And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.We can also connect with peoplebased on our very specific interests.We don't need a media companyto help do this for us.So the traditional media companies, of course,are paying very close attention to these online communities.They know this is the mass audience of the future;they need to figure it out.But they're having a hard time doing itbecause they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them,because that's how ad rates are still determined.When they're monitoring your clickstream --and you know they are --they have a really hard timefiguring out your age, your gender and your income.They can make some educated guesses.But they get a lot more informationabout what you do online,what you like, what interests you.That's easier for them to find out than who you are.And even though that's still sort of creepy,there is an upsideto having your taste monitored.Suddenly our taste is being respectedin a way that it hasn't been before.It had been presumed before.So when you look online at the way people aggregate,they don't aggregatearound age, gender and income.They aggregate around the things they love,the things that they like,and if you think about it, shared interests and valuesare a far more powerful aggregator of human beingsthan demographic categories.I'd much rather knowwhether you like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"rather than how old you are.That would tell me something more substantial about you.Now there's something else that we've discovered about social mediathat's actually quite surprising.It turns out that womenare really driving the social media revolution.If you look at the statistics --these are worldwide statistics --in every single age category,women actually outnumber menin their use of social networking technologies.And then if you look at the amount of timethat they spend on these sites,they truly dominate the social media space,which is a space that's having a huge impacton old media.The question is: what sort of impactis this going to have on our culture,and what's it going to mean for women?If the case is that social mediais dominating old mediaand women are dominating social media,then does that mean that womenare going to take over global media?Are we suddenly going to seea lot more female characters in cartoonsand in games and on TV shows?Will the next big-budget blockbuster moviesactually be chick flicks?Could this be possible,that suddenly our media landscapewill become a feminist landscape?Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women,because they realize this is important for their business,and I think that womenare also going to continue to dominatethe social media sphere.But I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough --responsible for driving a stake through the heartof cheesy genre categorieslike the "chick flick"and all these other genre categoriesthat presume that certain demographic groupslike certain things --that Hispanics like certain things,that young people like certain things.This is far too simplistic.The future entertainment media that we're going to seeis going to be very data-driven,and it's going to be based on the informationthat we ascertain from taste communities online,where women are really driving the action.So you may be asking, well why is it importantthat I know what entertains people?Why should I know this?Of course, old media companies and advertisersneed to know this.But my argument is that,if you want to understand the global village,it's probably a good idea that you figure outwhat they're passionate about, what amuses them,what they choose to do in their free time.This is a very important thing to know about people.I've spent most of my professional liferesearching media and entertainmentand its impact on people's lives.And I do it not just because it's fun --though actually, it is really fun --but also becauseour research has shown over and over againthat entertainment and playhave a huge impact on people's lives --for instance, on their political beliefsand on their health.And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world,looking at how people amuse themselvesis a really good way to start.So imagine a media atmospherethat isn't dominated by lame stereotypesabout genderand other demographic characteristics.Can you even imagine what that looks like?I can't wait to find out what it looks like.Thank you so much.(Applause)

Some of the greatest innovationsand developments in the worldoften happen at the intersection of two fields.So tonight I'd like to tell youabout the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment,which is entertainment and robotics.So if we're trying to make robotsthat can be more expressiveand that can connect better with us in society,maybe we should look to some of the human professionalsof artificial emotion and personalitythat occur in the dramatic arts.I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the artsand to attract peopleto science and technology.Some people in the last decade or twohave started creating artwork with technology.With my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot,I would like to use art to create tech.(Laughter)So we're based in New York City.And if you're a performer that wants to collaboratewith an adorable robot,or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation,please contact me, the Bot-Agent.The bot, our rising celebrity,also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild.I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data.He's named after the Star Trek character.I think he's going to be super popular.We've got the robot --in his head is a database of a lot of jokes.Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.It knows how much it's moving.And so it's going to try to watch your response.I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.(Laughter)It can also learn from youabout the quality of its jokesand cater things, sort of like Netflix-style,over longer-termto different communities or audiences,children versus adults, different cultures.You can learn something from the robotabout the community that you're in.And also I can use each one of you as the acting coachto our future robot companions.Some of you in this middle section --you have red/green paddles.If you like what's going on,show the green.If you don't like the subject or the performance,you can hold the red.Now don't be shy.It's just a robot.It doesn't have feelings ... yet.(Laughter)And the rest of you,you still count, you still matter.There's also a microphonethat's listening to the aggregate laughter and applauseand booing -- I hope not --to help make some of its next decisions.Right, so,let the robot stand-up comedy begin.Data: Hello TEDWomen.It's an honor to be here.(Laughter)(Applause)You guys are looking good out there.Ready for some jokes?Audience: Yeah.Data: Here's the first one.Right, so,a doctor says to his patient,"I have bad news and worse news.The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live.""That's terrible," said the patient."How can the news possibly be worse?""I've been trying to contact you since yesterday."(Laughter)(Applause)The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war.Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss.Data: Pretty lucky for them.Ever see that little Swiss Army knifethey have to fight with?"Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here.You get past me,the guy behind me has a spoon."(Laughter)HK: He's a French robot.Data: A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods.One of them falls to the ground.He does not seem to be breathing.The other guy whips out his cell phoneand calls 911.He gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead.What can I do?"The operator says, "Just take it easy.I can help.First, let's make sure he's dead."There is a silence,and the operator hears a shot.The guy's voice comes back on the line,"Okay, now what?"(Laughter)(Applause)Question: Why is television called a medium?Anyone?Because it's neither rare nor well done.But to be completely honest with you,I kind of love television.Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.Data: I find it incredibly educational.Actually, as soon as someone turns it on,I go into the other room and read.(Laughter)That's all for now.Was that okay for my first time?(Applause)You've been a great audience.Thank you.HK: Yay.(Applause)So this is actually the first timewe've ever done live audience feedback to a performance.So thank you all for being a part of it.There's a lot more to come.And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression.Thank you very much.(Applause)

If we look around us,much of what surrounds usstarted life as various rocks and sludgeburied in the ground in various places in the world.But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.They look like TV cameras, monitors,annoying radio mics.And so this magical transformationis what I was trying to get at with my project,which became known as the Toaster Project.And it was also inspired by this quotefrom Douglas Adams,and the situation is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."And the situation it describesis the hero of the book -- he's a 20th-century man --finds himself alone on a strange planetpopulated only by a technologically primitive people.And he kind of assumes that, yes,he'll become -- these villagers --he'll become their emperorand transform their societywith his wonderful command of technologyand science and the elements,but, of course, realizesthat without the rest of human society,he can barely make a sandwich,let alone a toaster.But he didn't have Wikipedia.So I thought, okay,I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch.And, working on the ideathat the cheapest electric toasterwould also be the simplest to reverse-engineer,I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find,took it homeand was kind of dismayed to discoverthat, inside this object,which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds,there were 400 different bitsmade out of a hundred-plus different materials.I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project.I had maybe nine months.So I thought, okay, I'll start with five.And these were steel, mica,plastic, copper and nickel.So, starting with steel: how do you make steel?I went and knocked on the doorof the Rio Tinto Chairof Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Minesand said, "How do you make steel?"And Professor Cilliers was very kindand talked me through it.And my vague rememberings from GCSE science --well, steel comes from iron,so I phoned up an iron mine.And said, "Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster.Can I come up and get some iron?"Unfortunately, when I got there -- emerges Ray.He had misheard meand thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster,and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines.But after some nagging, I got him to do that.(Video) Ray: It was Crease Limestone,and that was producedby sea creatures350 million years agoin a nice, warm,sunny atmosphere.When you study geology,you can see what's happened in the past,and there were terrific changes in the earth.Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore,because, though Ray was a miner there,the mine had closedand had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction,because, of course, it can't competeon the scale of operations which are happeningin South America, Australia, wherever.But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron oreand dragged it back to London on the train,and then was faced with the problem:Okay, how do you make this rockinto components for a toaster?So I went back to Professor Cilliers,and he said, "Go to the library."So I didand was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy --completely useless for what I was trying to do.Because, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do itif you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant.So I ended up going to the History of Science Libraryand looking at this book.This is the first textbook on metallurgywritten in the West, at least.And there you can see that woodcutis basically what I ended up doing.But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower.(Laughter)And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project,was, the smaller the scale you want to work on,the further back in time you have to go.And so this is aftera day and about half a nightsmelting this iron.I dragged out this stuff,and it wasn't iron.But luckily,I found a patent onlinefor industrial furnaces that use microwaves,and at 30 minutes at full power,and I was able to finish off the process.So, my next --(Applause)The next thing I was trying to get was copper.Again, this minewas once the largest copper mine in the world.It's not anymore,but I found a retired geology professorto take me down,and he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine."And the reason I was interested in getting wateris because water which goes through minesbecomes kind of acidicand will start picking up,dissolving the minerals from the mine.And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto,which is in Portugal.As you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it.So many suchthat it's now just a home for bacteriawho really like acidic, toxic conditions.But anyway, the water I dragged backfrom the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was --there was enough copper in itsuch that I could cast the pinsof my metal electric plug.So my next thing: I was off to Scotlandto get mica.And mica is a mineralwhich is a very good insulatorand very good at insulating electricity.That's me getting mica.And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic,and, of course,my toaster had to have a plastic case.Plastic is the defining featureof cheap electrical goods.And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BPand spent a good half an hourtrying to convince the PR office at BPthat it would be fantastic for themif they flew me to an oil rigand let me have a jug of oil.BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now.But even thenthey weren't convincedand said, "Okay, we'll phone you back" -- never did.So I looked at other ways of making plastic.And you can actually make plasticfrom obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches.So this is attempting to makepotato starch plastic.And for a while that was looking really good.I poured it into the mold, which you can see there,which I've made from a tree trunk.And it was looking good for a while,but I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry,and unfortunately I came backand there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.So kind of out of desperation,I decided that I could think laterally.And geologists have actually christened --well, they're debating whether to christen --the age that we're living in --they're debating whether to make it a new geological epochcalled the Anthropocene, the age of Man.And that's because geologists of the futurewould kind of see a sharp shiftin the strata of rock that is being laid down now.So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyland the 2,000 or so nuclear bombsthat have been set off since 1945.And there'd also be an extinction event --like fossils would suddenly disappear.And also, I thoughtthat there would besynthetic polymers,plastics, embedded in the rock.So I looked up a plastic --so I decided that I could minesome of this modern-day rock.And I went up to Manchesterto visit a place called Axion Recycling.And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE,which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive.And that was brought into forceto try and deal with the mountain of stuffthat is just being madeand then living for a while in our homesand then going to landfill.But this is it.(Music)(Laughter)So there's a pictureof my toaster.(Applause)That's it without the case on.And there it is on the shelves.Thanks.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.TT: Yeah, I did plug it in.I don't know if you could see,but I was never able to make insulation for the wires.Kew Gardens were insistentthat I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.So the wires were uninsulated.So there was 240 voltsgoing through these homemade copper wires,homemade plug.And for about five seconds,the toaster toasted,but then, unfortunately,the element kind of melted itself.But I considered it a partial success, to be honest.BG: Thomas Thwaites. TT: Thanks.

So I am a surgeon who studies creativity,and I have never had a patient tell me,is what led me to both be a surgeonabout my careerin terms of how I'm able to study musicof how the brain is able to be creative.so as a form of intense creativity,I think this is a great example.(Music)(Music ends)I've always as a listener, as a fan,I listen to that, and I'm astounded.I think -- how can this possibly be?that much music, spontaneously?meaning that it's a product of the brain.I took this thesis that we could study itAnd I think that's a good question.they're very dense,and when you go through them,and to miss the point of the music.This brings the second question:Why should scientists study creativity?Maybe we're not the right people to do it.(Laughter)we talked a lot about innovation today,the science of innovation,is in its infancy,I think that we're going to see,over the next 10, 20, 30 years,and is going to flourish,and study it rigorously.So it gets down to the brain.All of us have this remarkable brain,just ask a lot of questions.And that's what I do in my lab.The way that's done is by the following:There's something called BOLD imaging,it gets blood flow shunted to that area.Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI,whereas oxyhemoglobin can't.So through this method of inference --that we use for the jazz experiments.And it's a 35-key keyboarddesigned to fit both inside the scanner,be magnetically safe,(Music)(Music)(Music ends)OK, so it works.And so through this piano keyboard,in a way that's matched motoricallyI have here what we call the paradigms.then there's improvising on a scale,quarter notes, metronome, right hand --scientifically very safe,but musically really boring.which is what you heard me playing --(Music)(Music ends)but they're able to play real music.And I've listened to that solo 200 times,and I still like it.We first measured the number of notes.That was not what was going on.And then we looked at the brain activity.I will try to condense this for you.the frontal lobe of the brain,that went way up in activity.that went way down in activity,I'll summarize that for you.these are not the jazz areas of the brain.They do a whole host of thingsthat have to do with self-reflection,introspection, working memory etc.But we have this combinationor self-expressive, turning on.We think, at least in this preliminary --(Laughter)is that, to be creative,all of these new generative impulses.sometimes it's done communicatively.The next question was:something called "trading fours,"So this is a 12-bar blues,so you would know how you would trade.had them memorize this melodytrading back and forth interactively.So this is a musician, Mike Pope,(Music)a little better than I wrote it.(Video) CL: Mike, come on in.Mike Pope: May the force be with you.Nurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike?MP: No. Nothing's in my pockets.(Laughter)It's kind of fun, actually.(Music)Now we're playing back and forth.(Music)(Music)(Music ends)of what it's like.And it's good that it's not too quick.The fact that we do it over and over againlets you acclimate to your surroundings.looking at my hands through two mirrors,laying on my back,That was challenging.But again --there were moments, for sure --(Laughter)So what you're seeing here --and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science,which is to show you preliminary data.This is one subject's data.This is, in fact, Mike Pope's data.So what am I showing you here?in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left.He had it also homologous on the right.So we've done this on eight subjects now,and we're getting all the data together,Rap, of course, rap -- freestyle.I've always been fascinated by freestyle.And let's play this video.Rockin' it when I be, in your vicinityWhole-style synergy, recognize symmetryCL: So there's a lot of analogySo how do you study rap scientifically?This is what you do:that you write for them,and they said, "No, you won't."And then I thought --(Laughter)(Applause)But here's the thing.So what we had them doComputer: Memory, thump.CL: Thump of the beat in a known repeatRhythm and rhyme, they make me completeThe climb is sublime when I'm on the micComputer: Search.Psychopathic words in my head appearWhisper these lyrics only I can hearComputer: Art.Inside the mind of those unconfinedI need a mad scientist to check my brainComputer: Stop.(Applause)(Laughter)they will get cued different words.They don't know what's coming,but they'll hear something off the cuff.Go hit that right sound icon,Freestyler: I'm like some kind ofextraterrestrial, celestial sceneWith two microphones -- Computer: Headhovering over my headSee if I could still listen,spittin' off the soundSee what you grinningAbout the message of apocalypticalComputer: Not.instrumentalDetrimental playing Super Marioboxes [unclear] hip hopComputer: Stop.[fMRI of Hip-Hop Rap](Laughter)(Video) CL: We're here with Emmanuel.He's just memorized a rhyme for us.[Control Condition Memorized Verses]Emmanuel: Top of the beat with no repeatRhythm and rhyme make me completeClimb is sublime when I'm on the micComputer: Search.This is four rappers' brains.And we do see language areas lighting up,but then, eyes closed --when you are freestyling vs. memorizing,you've got major visual areas lighting up.you'll see real, meaningful studiesthat say science has to catch up to art,and maybe we're starting now to get there.Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.(Applause)

My big ideais a very, very small ideathat can unlockbillions of big ideasthat are at the moment dormant inside us.And my little idea that will do thatis sleep.(Laughter)(Applause)This is a room of type-A women.This is a roomof sleep-deprived women.And I learned the hard way,the value of sleep.Two-and-a-half years ago,I fainted from exhaustion.I hit my head on my desk. I broke my cheekbone,I got five stitches on my right eye.And I began the journeyof rediscovering the value of sleep.And in the course of that,I studied,I met with medical doctors, scientists,and I'm here to tell youthat the way to a more productive,more inspired, more joyful lifeis getting enough sleep.(Applause)And we women are going to lead the wayin this new revolution, this new feminist issue.We are literally going to sleep our way to the top, literally.(Laughter)(Applause)Because unfortunatelyfor men,sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol.I was recently having dinner with a guywho bragged that he had only gottenfour hours sleep the night before.And I felt like saying to him -- but I didn't say it --I felt like saying, "You know what?If you had gotten five,this dinner would have been a lot more interesting."(Laughter)There is now a kind of sleep deprivationone-upmanship.Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date,and you say, "How about eight o'clock?"they're likely to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me,but that's okay, I can get a game of tennis inand do a few conference calls and meet you at eight."And they think that meansthat they are so incredibly busy and productive,but the truth is they're not,because we, at the moment,have had brilliant leadersin business, in finance, in politics,making terrible decisions.So a high I.Q.does not mean that you're a good leader,because the essence of leadershipis being able to see the icebergbefore it hits the Titanic.And we've had far too many icebergshitting our Titanics.In fact, I have a feelingthat if Lehman Brotherswas Lehman Brothers and Sisters,they might still be around.(Applause)While all the brothers were busyjust being hyper-connected 24/7,maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg,because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleepand have been able to seethe big picture.So as we are facingall the multiple crisesin our world at the moment,what is good for us on a personal level,what's going to bring more joy, gratitude,effectiveness in our livesand be the best for our own careersis also what is best for the world.So I urge youto shut your eyesand discover the great ideasthat lie inside us,to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.Thank you.(Applause)



rufus_griscom_alisa_volkman_let_s_talk_parenting_taboos
2040179

Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins --the dramatic moments of the birthof our first son, Declan.Obviously a really profound moment,and it changed our lives in many ways.It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,and those unexpected ways we later reflected on,that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,and a year later, we launched Babble,a website for parents.Rufus Griscom: Now I think of our storyas starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.AV: We did.RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.It was a website called Nerve.com,the tagline of which was "literate smut."It was in theory, and hopefully in practice,a smart online magazineabout sex and culture.AV: That spawned a dating site.But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies.You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble,which we did.And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.RG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babblewas not just the life stage thing,which is, of course, relevant,but it was really more aboutour desire to speak very honestlyabout subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about.It seems to us thatwhen people start dissembling, people start lying about things,that's when it gets really interesting.That's a subject that we want to dive into.And we've been surprised to find, as young parents,that there are almost more taboos around parentingthan there are around sex.AV: It's true. So like we said,the early years were really wonderful,but they were also really difficult.And we feel like some of that difficultywas because of this false advertisement around parenting.(Laughter)We subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework,but really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this.And we went into parentingexpecting our lives to look like this.The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested,and in fact, it was not like that at all.RG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazinethat we were looking at, with these beautiful images,and looked at the scene in our actual living room,it looked a little bit more like this.These are our three sons.And of course, they're not always crying and screaming,but with three boys, there's a decent probabilitythat at least one of them will not be comporting himselfexactly as he should.AV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us.We really felt like what we went in expectinghad nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing,and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.We really wanted to let them understandwhat the realities of parenting were in an honest way.RG: So today, what we would love to dois share with you four parenting taboos.And of course, there are many more than four thingsyou can't say about parenting,but we would like to share with you todayfour that are particularly relevant for us personally.So the first, taboo number one:you can't say you didn't fall in love with your babyin the very first minute.I remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital.We were in the process of giving birth to our first child.AV: We, or I?RG: I'm sorry.Misuse of the pronoun.Alisa was very generously in the processof giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.)-- and I was there with a catcher's mitt.And I was there with my arms open.The nurse was coming at mewith this beautiful, beautiful child,and I remember, as she was approaching me,the voices of friends saying,"The moment they put the baby in your hands,you will feel a sense of love that will come over youthat is [on] an order of magnitude more powerfulthan anything you've ever experienced in your entire life."So I was bracing myself for the moment.The baby was coming,and I was ready for this Mack truck of loveto just knock me off my feet.And instead, when the baby was placed in my hands,it was an extraordinary moment.This picture is from literally a few seconds afterthe baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over.And you can see, our eyes were glistening.I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife,with deep, deep gratitudethat we had what appeared to be a healthy child.And it was also, of course, surreal.I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.I was incredulous, "Are you sure this is our child?"And this was all quite remarkable.But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection,but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.And so we've done something herethat is heretical.We have chartedour love for our child over time.(Laughter)This, as you know, is an act of heresy.You're not allowed to chart love.The reason you're not allowed to chart loveis because we think of love as a binary thing.You're either in love, or you're not in love.You love, or you don't love.And I think the reality is that love is a process,and I think the problem with thinking of loveas something that's binaryis that it causes usto be unduly concernedthat love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you.And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience.But I think a lot of men do go through this sensein the early months, maybe their first year,that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up,because you can notice where he dips in the first yearswhere I think I was doing most of the work.But we like to joke,in the first few months of all of our children's lives,this is Uncle Rufus.(Laughter)RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.AV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes homethat I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-upamongst other babies.So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.RG: Uh oh.AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.RG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here,and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.RG: The far left. AV: No!(Laughter)RG: Cruel.AV: Nothing more to be said.(Laughter)I'll move on to taboo number two.You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.I felt incredibly connected to the community around me.I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me,tracking it down till the actual due-date.I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating.I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.It was a really wonderful experience,but when I got home,I suddenly felt very disconnectedand suddenly shut in and shut out,and I was really surprised by those feelings.I did expect it to be difficult,have sleepless nights, constant feedings,but I did not expect the feelingsof isolation and loneliness that I experienced,and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me,that I was going to be feeling this way.And I called my sisterwhom I'm very close to -- and had three children --and I asked her, "Why didn't you tell meI was going to be feeling this way,that I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?"And she said -- I'll never forget --"It's just not something you want to say to a motherthat's having a baby for the first time."RG: And of course, we thinkit's precisely what you really should be sayingto mothers who have kids for the first time.And that this, of course, one of the themes for usis that we thinkthat candor and brutal honestyis critical to us collectivelybeing great parents.And it's hard not to thinkthat part of what leads to this sense of isolationis our modern world.So Alisa's experience is not isolated.So your 58 percent of mothers surveyedreport feelings of loneliness.Of those, 67 percent are most lonelywhen their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two.In the process of preparing this,we looked at how some other cultures around the worlddeal with this period of time,because here in the Western world,less than 50 percent of us live near our family members,which I think is part of why this is such a tough period.So to take one example among many:in Southern Indiathere's a practice known as jholabhari,in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant,moves in with her motherand goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies,give birth and returns home to her nuclear familyseveral months after the child is born.And this is one of many waysthat we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.AV: So taboo number three:you can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine.So after we had Declan,we kind of recalibrated our expectations.We thought we actually could go through this againand thought we knew what we would be up against.And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant,and I soon learned that we were having a boy,and then when I was five months,we learned that we had lost our child.This is actually the last little image we have of him.And it was obviously a very difficult time --really painful.As I was working through that mourning process,I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody.I really wanted to crawl into a hole,and I didn't really know how I was goingto work my way back into my surrounding community.And I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way,is on a really deep gut level,I was feeling a lot of shameand embarrassed, frankly,that, in some respects, I had failedat delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do.And of course, it made me question,if I wasn't able to have another child,what would that mean for my marriage,and just me as a woman.So it was a very difficult time.As I started working through it more,I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people.I was really amazedby all the stories that started flooding in.People I interacted with daily,worked with, was friends with,family members that I had known a long time,had never shared with me their own stories.And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork,and I felt like I happened uponthis secret society of women that I now was a part of,which was reassuring and also really concerning.And I think,miscarriage is an invisible loss.There's not really a lot of community support around it.There's really no ceremony,rituals, or rites.And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life,and there's a lot of community support,and it's something women don't have with miscarriage.RG: Which is too bad because, of course,it's a very common and very traumatic experience.Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage,and I find this astounding.In a survey, 74 percent of women saidthat miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful.And astoundingly, 22 percentsaid they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.So taboo number four:you can't say that your average happinesshas declined since having a child.The party line is that every single aspect of my lifehas just gotten dramatically betterever since I participatedin the miracle that is childbirth and family.I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day,our first son, Declan, was nine months old,and I was sitting there on the couch,and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, "Stumbling on Happiness."And I got about two-thirds of the way through,and there was a chart on the right-hand side --on the right-hand page --that we've labeled here"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginablefor a New Parent."This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies.Basically, there's this precipitous dropof marital satisfaction,which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness,that doesn't rise againuntil your first child goes to college.So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life,this chasm of happinessthat we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into.We were despondent.AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult,but we'd come out of it,and were really shocked to see this study.So we really wanted to take a deeper look at itin hopes that we would find a silver lining.RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents,because we got this incredible reporterto go and interview all the scientistswho conducted these four studies.We said, something is wrong here.There's something missing from these studies.It can't possibly be that bad.So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece,and she interviewed four scientists,and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert,and we did indeed find a silver lining.So this is our guessas to what this baseline of average happinessarguably looks like throughout life.Average happiness is, of course, inadequate,because it doesn't speakto the moment-by-moment experience,and so this is what we think it looks likewhen you layer inmoment-to-moment experience.And so we all remember as children,the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children --the teeniest little thingcan just rocket them to these heightsof just utter adulation,and then the next teeniest little thingcan cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves.And then, of course, as you get older,it's almost like age is a form of lithium.As you get older, you become more stable.And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s,is you start to learn to hedge your happiness.You start to realize that"Hey, I could go to this live music eventand have an utterly transforming experiencethat will cover my entire body with goosebumps,but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobicand I won't be able to get a beer.So I'm not going to go.I've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go."So your average happiness goes up,but you lose those transcendent moments.AV: Yeah, and then you have your first child,and then you really resubmit yourselfto these highs and lows --the highs being the first steps, the first smile,your child reading to you for the first time --the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night.But you realize you resubmit yourselfto losing control in a really wonderful way,which we think provides a lot of meaning to our livesand is quite gratifying.RG: And so in effect,we trade average happiness.We trade the sort of security and safetyof a certain level of contentmentfor these transcendent moments.So where does that leave the two of usas a family with our three little boysin the thick of all this?There's another factor in our case.We have violated yet another tabooin our own lives,and this is a bonus taboo.AV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together,especially with three children --and we are.RG: And we had reservations about this on the front end.Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse.In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble,the venture capitalists said,"We categorically don't investin companies founded by husbands and wives,because there's an extra point of failure.It's a bad idea. Don't do it."And we obviously went forward. We did.We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did,because in this phase of one's life,the incredibly scarce resource is time.And if you're really passionate about what you do every day -- which we are --and you're also passionate about your relationship,this is the only way we know how to do it.And so the final question that we would ask is:can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards?It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy,but they're sometimes pretty quick.And so how about that average baseline of happiness?Can we move that up a little bit?AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about,is really the result of walking into parenting --and really any long-term partnership for that matter --with the wrong expectations.And if you have the right expectations and expectation management,we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience.RG: And so this is what --And we think that a lot of parents,when you get in there -- in our case anyway --you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go.Get out of the airplane,it turns out you're trekking in Nepal.And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience,particularly if you pack your bags properlyand you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched.So the point of all this for us todayis not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty,but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences,that we can all collectivelybend that happiness baseline up a little bit.RG + AV: Thank you.(Applause)

Restaurants and the food industry in generalare pretty much the most wasteful industryin the world.For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today,10 calories are taken to produce it.That's a lot.I want to take something rather humbleto discuss.I found this in the farmers' market today,and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.The humble potato --and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.And it pretty much goes througheight different forms in its lifetime.First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.It grows and is nurtured.It's then harvested.It's then distributed,and distribution is a massive issue.It's then sold and bought,and it's then delivered to me.I basically take it, prepare it,and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it.The last stage is basically waste,and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it.There are different types of waste.There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy;and there's a waste of waste.And every business I've been working onover the past five years,I'm trying to lower each one of these elements.Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like.Basically a restaurant just like any other.This is the restaurant, Acorn House.Front and back.So let me run you through a few ideas.Floor: sustainable, recyclable.Chairs: recycled and recyclable.Tables: Forestry Commission.This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood.This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom --she didn't like sitting on it,so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale --reusing, a job that was pretty good.I hate waste, especially walls.If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did,and that shows all the customers my products.The whole business is run on sustainable energy.This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs.Paint is all low-volume chemical,which is very important when you're working in the room all the time.I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it --but there's a work surface there.And that's a plastic polymer.And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,experiment with polymers.Will they outlive me? They probably might.Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.Now reusing is vital.And we filter our own water.We put them in bottles, refrigerate them,and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.Here's a great little example.If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,which has been turned inside out and sewn up.It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.This is the kitchen, which is in the same room.I basically created a menu that allowed peopleto choose the amount and volume of foodthat they wanted to consume.Rather than me putting a dish down,they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.It serves 220 people a day.We generate quite a lot of waste.This is the waste room.You can't get rid of waste.But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.In here, I have produce and boxesthat are unavoidable.I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator --turns food into an inner material,which I can store and then compost later.I compost it in this garden.All of the soil you can see there is basically my food,which is generated by the restaurant,and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled treesand wine casks and all kinds of things.Three compost bins --go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week --really good, makes fantastic compost.A couple of wormeries in there too.And actually one of the wormerieswas a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.And I tried taking the dried food waste,putting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner."It was like vegetable jerky,and killed all of them.I don't know how many worms [were] in there,but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.(Laughter)What you're seeing here is a water filtration system.This takes the water out of the restaurant,runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there --and I sort of water the garden with it.And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,maybe wash hands with it, I don't know.So, water is a very important aspect.I started meditating on thatand created a restaurant called Waterhouse.If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurantthat is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.I managed to do it.This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House --same chairs, same tables.They're all English and a little bit more sustainable.But this is an electrical restaurant.The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.And it's run on hydroelectricity,so I've gone from air to water.Now it's important to understandthat this roomis cooled by water, heated by water,filters its own water,and it's powered by water.It literally is Waterhouse.The air handling system inside it --I got rid of air-conditioningbecause I thought there was too much consumption going on there.This is basically air-handling.I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.And this is an English willow air diffuser,and that's softly movingthat air current through the room.Very advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it.In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,there is hundreds of meters of coil piping.This takes the temperature of the canaland turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.(Laughter)And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurantlives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.There's no accident in names of these restaurants.Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be makingfive restaurants basedon the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.I've got metal and earth to come.So you've got to watch your space for that.Okay. So this is my next project.Five weeks old,it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.The People's Supermarket.So basically, the restaurants only really hitpeople who believed in what I was doing anyway.What I needed to do was get food outto a broader spectrum of people.So people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class --or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.This is a social enterprise,not-for-profit cooperative supermarket.It really is about the social disconnectbetween food, communitiesin urban settingsand their relationship to rural growers --connecting communities in London to rural growers.Really important.So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff.I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make thisthe most sustainable supermarket in the world.That's zero food waste.And no one's doing that just yet.In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,let's have a go. Try it on.I'm going to get there before you.So nature doesn't create wastedoesn't create waste as such.Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cyclewith waste being the end of the beginning,and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,and it's an important statement to understand.If we don't stand upand make a differenceand think about sustainable food,think about the sustainable nature of it,then we may fail.But, I wanted to get up and show youthat we can do it if we're more responsible.Environmentally conscious businesses are doable.They're here. You can see I've done three so far;I've got a few more to go.The idea is embryonic.I think it's important.I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuseand recycle -- right at the end there --recycling is the last point I want to make;but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's --then I think we're going to be on our way.So these three are not perfect -- they're ideas.I think that there are many problems to come,but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.And I hope you all take part.Thank you very much. (Applause)

Well, there's lots to talk about,but I think I'm just going to play to start off.(Music)♫ When I wake up ♫♫ in the morning ♫♫ I pour the coffee ♫♫ I read the paper ♫♫ And then I slowly ♫♫ and so softly ♫♫ do the dishes ♫♫ So feed the fishes ♫♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫♫ Like it's gonna be ♫♫ your last day ♫♫ here on Earth ♫(Applause)All right.So, I wanted to do something special today.I want to debut a new song that I've been working onin the last five or six months.And there's few things more thrillingthan playing a songfor the first time in front of an audience,especially when it's half-finished.(Laughter)I'm kind of hoping some conversations heremight help me finish it.Because it gets into all sortsof crazy realms.And so this is basically a songabout loops,but not the kind of loops that I make up here.They're feedback loops.And in the audio worldthat's when the microphone gets too closeto its sound source,and then it gets in this self-destructive loopthat creates a very unpleasant sound.And I'm going to demonstrate for you.(Laughter)I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry.♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫♫ This is a -- (Feedback)All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate --(Laughter)-- but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction.And I've been thinking abouthow that applies across a whole spectrum of realms,from, say, the ecological, okay.There seems to be a rule in naturethat if you get too close to where you came from,it gets ugly.So like, you can't feed cows their own brainsor you get mad cow disease,and inbreeding and incestand, let's see,what's the other one?Biological -- there's autoimmune diseases,where the body attacks itselfa little too overzealouslyand destroys the host,or the person.And then -- okay, this is where we get to the song --kind of bridges the gap to the emotional.Because although I've used scientific termsin songs,it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical.And there's some thingsyou just don't need to have in songs.So I'm trying to bridge this gapbetween this idea and this melody.And so, I don't know if you've ever had this,but when I close my eyes sometimesand try to sleep,I can't stop thinking about my own eyes.And it's like your eyesstart straining to see themselves.That's what it feels like to me.It's not pleasant.I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head.(Laughter)It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves,but they seem to be trying.So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience.Or ears being able to hear themselves --it's just impossible.That's the thing.So, I've been working on this songthat mentions these thingsand then also imaginesa person who's been so successfulat defending themselves from heartbreakthat they're left to do the deed themselves,if that's possible.And that's what the song is asking.All right.It doesn't have a name yet.(Music)♫ Go ahead and congratulate yourself ♫♫ Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand ♫♫ And the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫♫ And the ear that hears itself is near ♫♫ 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh ♫♫ You've done the impossible now ♫♫ Took yourself apart ♫♫ You made yourself invulnerable ♫♫ No one can break your heart ♫♫ So you wear it out ♫♫ And you wring it out ♫♫ And you wear it out ♫♫ And you break it yourself ♫♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫♫ Breaking your own ♫(Applause)Thanks.(Applause)All right.It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder.You can throw out crazy theoriesand not have to back it up with dataor graphs or research.But, you know, I think reckless curiositywould be what the world needs now,just a little bit.(Applause)I'm going to finish up with a song of minecalled "Weather Systems."(Music)♫ Quiet ♫♫ Quiet down, she said ♫♫ Speak into the back of his head ♫♫ On the edge of the bed, I can see your blood flow ♫♫ I can see your ♫♫ cells grow ♫♫ Hold still awhile ♫♫ Don't spill the wine ♫♫ I can see it all from here ♫♫ I can see ♫♫ oh, I ♫♫ I can see ♫♫ weather systems ♫♫ of the world ♫♫ Weather systems ♫♫ of the world ♫♫ Some things you say ♫♫ are not for sale ♫♫ I would hold it where ♫♫ our free agents of some substance are ♫♫ scared ♫♫ Hold still a while ♫♫ Don't spill the wine ♫♫ I can see it all from here ♫♫ I can see ♫♫ oh, I ♫♫ I can see ♫♫ weather systems of the world ♫♫ Weather systems ♫♫ of the world ♫Thanks.(Applause)

I love video games.I'm also slightly in awe of them.I'm in awe of their powerin terms of imagination, in terms of technology,in terms of concept.But I think, above all,I'm in awe at their powerto motivate, to compel us,to transfix us,like really nothing else we've ever inventedhas quite done before.And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing thingsby looking at how we do this.And in particular, I think we can learn thingsabout learning.Now the video games industryis far and away the fastest growingof all modern media.From about 10 billion in 1990,it's worth 50 billion dollars globally today,and it shows no sign of slowing down.In four years' time,it's estimated it'll be worth over 80 billion dollars.That's about three times the recorded music industry.This is pretty stunning,but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all.The thing that really amazes meis that, today,people spend abouteight billion real dollars a yearbuying virtual itemsthat only existinside video games.This is a screenshot from the virtual game world, Entropia Universe.Earlier this year,a virtual asteroid in itsold for 330,000 real dollars.And thisis a Titan class shipin the space game, EVE Online.And this virtual objecttakes 200 real peopleabout 56 days of real time to build,plus countless thousands of hoursof effort before that.And yet, many of these get built.At the other end of the scale,the game Farmville that you may well have heard of,has 70 million playersaround the worldand most of these playersare playing it almost every day.This may all soundreally quite alarming to some people,an index of something worryingor wrong in society.But we're here for the good news,and the good news isthat I think we can explorewhy this very real human effort,this very intense generation of value, is occurring.And by answering that question,I think we can take somethingextremely powerful away.And I think the most interesting wayto think about how all this is going onis in terms of rewards.And specifically, it's in termsof the very intense emotional rewardsthat playing games offers to peopleboth individuallyand collectively.Now if we look at what's going on in someone's headwhen they are being engaged,two quite different processes are occurring.On the one hand, there's the wanting processes.This is a bit like ambition and drive -- I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard.On the other hand, there's the liking processes,fun and affectionand delightand an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back.It's a really great image. It's pretty cool.It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally,one of whom is me, another of whom is my wife.And this kind of a world,this vast flying beast you can ride around,shows why games are so very goodat doing both the wanting and the liking.Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome.It gives you great powers.Your ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful.It's a very great pleasure to fly around.And so these combine to forma very intense emotional engagement.But this isn't the really interesting stuff.The really interesting stuff about virtualityis what you can measure with it.Because what you can measure in virtualityis everything.Every single thing that every single personwho's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured.The biggest games in the world todayare measuring more than one billion points of dataabout their players, about what everybody does --far more detail than you'd ever get from any website.And this allows something very specialto happen in games.It's something called the reward schedule.And by this, I mean lookingat what millions upon millions of people have doneand carefully calibrating the rate,the nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in gamesto keep them engagedover staggering amounts of time and effort.Now, to try and explain thisin sort of real terms,I want to talk about a kind of taskthat might fall to you in so many games.Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item.Let's say, for the sake of argument,my mission is to get 15 piesand I can get 15 piesby killing these cute, little monsters.Simple game quest.Now you can think about this, if you like,as a problem about boxes.I've got to keep opening boxes.I don't know what's inside them until I open them.And I go around opening box after box until I've got 15 pies.Now, if you take a game like Warcraft,you can think about it, if you like,as a great box-opening effort.The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes,getting better and better stuff in them.This sounds immensely boringbut games are ableto make this processincredibly compelling.And the way they do thisis through a combination of probability and data.Let's think about probability.If we want to engage someonein the process of opening boxes to try and find pies,we want to make sure it's neither too easy,nor too difficult, to find a pie.So what do you do? Well, you look at a million people --no, 100 million people, 100 million box openers --and you work out, if you make the pie rateabout 25 percent --that's neither too frustrating, nor too easy.It keeps people engaged.But of course, that's not all you do -- there's 15 pies.Now, I could make a game called Piecraft,where all you had to do was get a million piesor a thousand pies.That would be very boring.Fifteen is a pretty optimal number.You find that -- you know, between five and 20is about the right number for keeping people going.But we don't just have pies in the boxes.There's 100 percent up here.And what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened,there's something in it, some little rewardthat keeps people progressing and engaged.In most adventure games,it's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience.But we don't just do that either.We also say there's going to be loads of other itemsof varying qualities and levels of excitement.There's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item.There's going to be a 0.1 percent chanceyou get an absolutely awesome item.And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item.And also, we say,"Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?"No, we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time.So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult.So all this is very powerful.But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes.So we can dosome rather amazing things.We notice, looking at all these people opening boxes,that when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies,their perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy.They're not rational about probability.They think this game is unfair.It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up.If they're real boxes, there's not much we can do,but in a game we can just say, "Right, well.When you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now."Keep you engaged. Look at what people do --adjust the world to match their expectation.Our games don't always do this.And one thing they certainly do at the momentis if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item,they make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of timeto keep the value, to keep it special.And the point is reallythat we evolved to be satisfied by the worldin particular ways.Over tens and hundreds of thousands of years,we evolved to find certain things stimulating,and as very intelligent, civilized beings,we're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning.But now, we can reverse engineer thatand build worldsthat expressly tick our evolutionary boxes.So what does all this mean in practice?Well, I've come upwith seven thingsthat, I think, showhow you can take these lessons from gamesand use them outside of games.The first one is very simple:experience bars measuring progress --something that's been talked about brilliantlyby people like Jesse Schell earlier this year.It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places.It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementallyin little bits and pieces,you give them one profile character avatarwhich is constantly progressingin tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own.And everything comes towards that,and they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along.Second, multiple long and short-term aims --5,000 pies, boring,15 pies, interesting.So, you give peoplelots and lots of different tasks.You say, it's aboutdoing 10 of these questions,but another taskis turning up to 20 classes on time,but another task is collaborating with other people,another task is showing you're working five times,another task is hitting this particular target.You break things down into these calibrated slicesthat people can choose and do in parallelto keep them engagedand that you can use to point themtowards individually beneficial activities.Third, you reward effort.It's your 100 percent factor. Games are brilliant at this.Every time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying.You don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort --a little bit of gold, a little bit of credit. You've done 20 questions -- tick.It all feeds in as minute reinforcement.Fourth, feedback.This is absolutely crucial,and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this.If you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world todaythat we've been hearing amazing things about,it's very, very hard for people to learnif they cannot link consequences to actions.Pollution, global warming, these things --the consequences are distant in time and space.It's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson.But if you can model things for people,if you can give things to people that they can manipulateand play with and where the feedback comes,then they can learn a lesson, they can see,they can move on, they can understand.And fifth,the element of uncertainty.Now this is the neurological goldmine,if you like,because a known rewardexcites people,but what really gets them goingis the uncertain reward,the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty,that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not.The 25 percent. This lights the brain up.And if you think aboutusing this in testing,in just introducing control elements of randomnessin all forms of testing and training,you can transform the levels of people's engagementby tapping into this very powerfulevolutionary mechanism.When we don't quite predict something perfectly,we get really excited about it.We just want to go back and find out more.As you probably know, the neurotransmitterassociated with learning is called dopamine.It's associated with reward-seeking behavior.And something very exciting is just beginning to happenin places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.,where we are beginning to be able to model mathematicallydopamine levels in the brain.And what this means is we can predict learning,we can predict enhanced engagement,these windows, these windows of time,in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level.And two things really flow from this.The first has to do with memory,that we can find these moments.When someone is more likely to remember,we can give them a nugget in a window.And the second thing is confidence,that we can see how game-playing and reward structuresmake people braver, make them more willing to take risks,more willing to take on difficulty,harder to discourage.This can all seem very sinister.But you know, sort of "our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts."The word "addiction" is thrown around.There are real concerns there.But the biggest neurological turn-on for peopleis other people.This is what really excites us.In reward terms, it's not money;it's not being given cash -- that's nice --it's doing stuff with our peers,watching us, collaborating with us.And I want to tell you a quick story about 1999 --a video game called EverQuest.And in this video game,there were two really big dragons, and you had to team up to kill them --42 people, up to 42 to kill these big dragons.That's a problembecause they dropped two or three decent items.So players addressed this problemby spontaneously coming up with a systemto motivate each other,fairly and transparently.What happened was, they paid each other a virtual currencythey called "dragon kill points."And every time you turned up to go on a mission,you got paid in dragon kill points.They tracked these on a separate website.So they tracked their own private currency,and then players could bid afterwardsfor cool items they wanted --all organized by the players themselves.Now the staggering system, not just that this worked in EverQuest,but that today, a decade on,every single video game in the world with this kind of taskuses a version of this system --tens of millions of people.And the success rateis at close to 100 percent.This is a player-developed,self-enforcing, voluntary currency,and it's incredibly sophisticatedplayer behavior.And I just want to end by suggestinga few ways in which these principlescould fan out into the world.Let's start with business.I mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problemsaround something like business arerecycling and energy conservation.We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologieslike real-time energy meters.And I just look at this, and I think, yes,we could take that so much furtherby allowing people to set targetsby setting calibrated targets,by using elements of uncertainty,by using these multiple targets,by using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system,by setting people upto collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streetsto collaborate and compete,to use these very sophisticatedgroup and motivational mechanics we see.In terms of education,perhaps most obviously of all,we can transform how we engage people.We can offer people the grand continuityof experience and personal investment.We can break things downinto highly calibrated small tasks.We can use calculated randomness.We can reward effort consistentlyas everything fields together.And we can use the kind of group behaviorsthat we see evolving when people are at play together,these really quite unprecedentedly complexcooperative mechanisms.Government, well, one thing that comes to mindis the U.S. government, among others,is literally starting to pay peopleto lose weight.So we're seeing financial reward being usedto tackle the great issue of obesity.But again, those rewardscould be calibrated so preciselyif we were able to use the vast expertiseof gaming systems to just jack up that appeal,to take the data, to take the observations,of millions of human hoursand plow that feedbackinto increasing engagement.And in the end, it's this word, "engagement,"that I want to leave you with.It's about how individual engagementcan be transformedby the psychological and the neurological lessonswe can learn from watching people that are playing games.But it's also about collective engagementand about the unprecedented laboratoryfor observing what makes people tickand work and play and engageon a grand scale in games.And if we can look at these things and learn from themand see how to turn them outwards,then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands.Thank you very much.(Applause)

The moment I say "school,"so many memories come back to me.the teacher would say, "Hey, come.How did you do?"And I didn't understand why,in one hand they say, "Speak the truth,"So it went on like that,So I remember those nightsI used to go to sleepwith asking help from [the] Unknownbecause, for some reason,hanged in the Puja room as a god,because my friend's familyhad something else as a god.and ask help,"and started getting help from everywhere,Then, when I was in eighth standardaround 13 years old,I started working in a part-time job"Oh, he's bad at studies,And one of those competitions,And I didn't have the patience to waituntil I reached home.If you travel in Indian trains,you can see people listening to radioand, you know, even from their mobiles.So at that time -- and I was 13 --and I was listening to just radio,and someone happened to sit next to me,like these three people are sitting here.You know, like just adjacent to me.I thinkyou should study in a school of art.You just quit school and come there."So, why I'm telling you this,you know, maybe, you know,So that's what made me enter[the] college of arts after three attemptsand just continue to inquireand finally I'm here in front of you.When I look back, you know,on what happened between that timeand now here --the last 10/15 years --I can see that most of the worksrevolve around three subjects,but it was not intentional."What really makes us?" -- you know,So I was thinking,but when you look at the past,the way to understand the pastis only by the traces available,because we cannot go back [to] the past.It can be ruins, or it can be music,And that fascinated me,to explore that territory.So I was working on the line,but instead of working about traces,I started capturing traces.So this is called "Self In Progress."It's just a trace of being in this body.So here, what happened then,you know -- what I really enjoyed the mostis that this sculptureis nothing but a trace of myself.It's almost like a 3D photograph.So there is an element of performance,and there is an element of sculpture,And then moved slowlyit's such a great experience,because we have freedom of like walking,but the moment this becomes solid,when you cannot move even an inch,because, knowingly or unknowingly,So I just thought, "I'm going to capturethumbprint, footprint,or whatever traces we leave as humans."This is the trace of fire,this is the trace of sun.this thought comes to me always:or is there other ways to capture it?"So this work is nothing but like --because of the focal length of the lens,it just shows what is on the other side.which was an etching print,This is called "Dawn to Dawn."then put a coconut rope,and just burnt it.So wherever the fire is eating the paper,that's what becomes the work --detail.Even though we have traceswhen we try to understand them,the perception and contextplay a major role to understand it.So do we really understand what it is,or are we trying to getwhat we think it is?because, even though there are traces,So like let's say even a simple act.Can you just raise the hand?If you just ask an opinionof how, everyone can interpret it.Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says,He would say, "For the greater good."Martin Luther King would say,to cross the road,(Laughter)Imagine Moses comes now, and he seesthe same cow walking around the street.He would definitely say,"God came down from heaven,and he said unto the cow,'Thou shalt cross the road.'And cow crossed the road,(Laughter)Freud would say,"The fact that you're at all concerned(Laughter)If we ask Einstein,or the road moved underneath the cow,depends on your frame of reference."(Laughter)Or Buddha --if he saw the same cow, he would say,(Laughter)So, what we seeis just what we think often,It just all depends on one's perception.And context, what is really context?It's just created by the mind.If you look at this piece of paper,this is the breadthand this is called length.This is how we've been taught in school.But if you tear it in the middle --now, I didn't touch this breadth,but still, the meaning of this changes.So what we conceive as a meaningis always not there;it's on the other side,even when we say dark, light,good, bad, tall, short --all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.It's just that being a human,the way we train to perceive the realitycreates this meaning.So this work from this periodis mostly like --It's just captured through from the lamp.This is called "Limit Out."do we really see?This is an exact negative.It's about six inches deep in the wall,You know the wall is almost like --Again, "Inward Out."It's a full-figure cast from myself.It's about eight inches deep.whenever I see the bird flying in the sky,it just makes me feel like:which as a human, we don't see them?Is there any way to capture the thoughtinto visual art?I couldn't find it.But a solution arrivedin the restroom,when I was changing the air freshenerthat goes from solid substance to vapor.It's called Odonil.because I wrote to Balsara,Will you help me to make this sculpture?"They never wrote back to me.Facilitating Unit and ask help."They said, "Of course.This is the fee for the project report,Finally, I went back to them and said,Please come for the show."And they did.You buy this for 3,000 rupees,it'll become 30,000 in two months.This is the craft that was going on,but there are a few collectorswho also collect art which can depreciate.And this was collected by Anupam --because it will evaporate.So this is after a few weeks,this is after a few months.And if they say it's solid,it will not be solid, it will evaporate.And if they say they don't get it,that's also not true,because it's in the air.So they inhaled it,but they are not aware of it.While I was doing that work,my mom and my dad,they were looking at it and they said,And I was like, "What do you mean?""Of course not. For me," I'm thinking,"this is tucked in some small solid,but the moment it evaporates,it's merged with the whole."But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.Can you make something from nothingas a sculptor?"I said, "No, mom. It can't be.Because we can createa sculptureby gathering dust together,So, I did this work for her.It's called "Emerging Angel."This is the first day --it just gives the appearancethat one is becoming the other.So, the same sculptureafter a few days.This is after 15/20 days.Through that small little slitbetween the glass box and the wood,This gave me a greater faith.to capture [the] invisible.So what you see nowis called "Shadow Foreshadow."And what I'd like to tell youwe see the source of the light.but it's filled with light all the time.When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.The same thing in the darkroom.and we realize the existence of light.So we don't see dark, we don't see light,So, I just started doing this workto inquire furtherabout how to sculptthe space between this object and there.but how to sculpt this, you know?I did this as an experimentof casting the shadow.Then the second one --So that produced a shadow.Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.Then, again, that becomes an object.Again, throwing light, then the third one.So what you see is nothing but shadowof a shadow of a shadow.I thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished."You can see the detail.This is called "Gravity."It's a false wall, which containslike 110 cubic feet.So that hole actuallymakes the air come out and go in.So where it's happening, we can see,This is called "Kaayam."Detail.And what I'd like to tell you,our senses are so limited --We don't feel, "I am touching the air,"So all of our construction of realityis through these limited senses.So my request was like,is there any way to use all thisas just a symbol or a sign?And to really get to the point,we should move beyond, you know,like are invisible.you will miss the pointThank you.(Applause)



jim_toomey_learning_from_sherman_the_shark

Cartoons are basically short stories.I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words.Not all of them have happy endings.So how did I get started cartooning?I doodled a lot as a kid,and if you spend enough time doodling,sooner or later, something happens:all your career options run out.So you have to make a living cartooning.Actually, I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy,when I was about eight or nine.And I was particularly fascinated with sharks.This is some of my early work.Eventually, my mom took the red crayon away,so it was [unclear].But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of minethat really made me see the ocean differently,and it's become the foundation of my workbecause, I feel like, if in a day,I can see the ocean differently,then I can evoke that same kind of change in others,especially kids.Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean.It's just a big blue surface.And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time.It's a mystery.There's been a lot of folkloredeveloped around the ocean,mostly negative.And that prompted people to make maps like this,with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land,but when you get to the waters edge,the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint.And this is the way I saw the ocean at school --as if to say, "All geography and science lessonsstop at water's edge.This part's not going to be on the test."But that day I flew low over the islands --it was a family trip to the Caribbean,and I flew in a small plane low over the islands.This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys.I saw forests and meadows.I saw grottoes and secret gardensand places I'd love to hide as a kid,if I could only breathe underwater.And best of all, I saw the animals.I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in.And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it,and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born.So from that day on, I was an ordinary kidwalking around on dry land,but my head was down there, underwater.Up until that day,these were the animals that were most common in my life.These were the ones I'd like to draw --all variations of four legs and fur.But when you got to the ocean,my imagination was no competition for nature.Every time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board,I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier.And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragonand this enormous humpback whalewas like something out of a science-fiction movie.Whenever I talk to kids, I always like to tell them,the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive.It's not a dinosaur; it's a whale,animals as big as office buildingsstill swimming around out there in our ocean.Speaking of dinosaurs, sharks are basicallythe same fish they were 300 million years ago.So if you ever fantasize about going back in timeand seeing what a dinosaur looked like,that's what a dinosaur looks like.So you have living dinosaursand space aliens,animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions.It's just incredible; no Hollywood designercould come up with something more interesting than that.Or this fangtooth. The particles in the watermake it look like it's floating in outer space.Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescopeand we saw that?It would start a whole new space race.But instead, we stick a camera in the deep ocean,and we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imaginationas a society.We say to ourselves,"Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something."So, what I'd like to do nowis try a little drawing.So, I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here.I love to draw the deep sea fish,because they are so ugly,but beautiful in their own way.Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here --give him a headlight,maybe a brake light,turn signals.But it's easy to see why these animalsmake such great cartoon characters,their shapes and sizes.So some of them actually seem to have powerslike superheroes in a comic book.For instance,take these sea turtles.They kind of have a sixth senselike Superman's x-ray vision.They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth.And they can use that senseto navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean.I kind of give my turtle handsjust to make them an easier cartoon character to work with.Or take this sea cucumber.It's not an animal we draw cartoons ofor draw at all.He's like an underwater Spiderman.He shoots out these sticky websto entangle his enemy.Of course, sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears,which, in my opinion, makes them much more interesting a superhero.(Laughter)He can't spin a web anytime; he's got to pull his pants down first.(Laughter)Or the blowfish.The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk.It can change its bodyinto a big, intimidating fishin a matter of seconds.I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated.And then I'm going to attemptonscreen animation here.Let's see.Try and inflate it.(Laughter)"You talkin' to me?" See, he can inflate himselfwhen he wants to be intimidating.Or take this swordfish.Could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose?Do you think he wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says,"Somebody's getting stabbed today."Or this lionfish for instance.Imagine trying to make friendscovered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs.It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page, right?My characters are --my lead character's a shark named Sherman.He's a great white shark.And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman.I didn't want to go with this ruthlesspredator image.He's kind of just out there making a living.He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins.And then his sidekickis a sea turtle, as I mentioned before, named Filmore.He uses his wonderful skills at navigationto wander the oceans, looking for a mate.And he does manage to find them,but great navigation skills, lousy pick-up lines.He never seemsto settle onany particular girl.I have a hermit crab named Hawthorne,who doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab,so he kind of wisheshe were a great white shark.And then I'll introduce you to one more character,this guy, Ernest,who is basically a juvenile delinquentin a fish body.So with characters, you can make stories.Sometimes making a story is as easyas putting two characters in a roomand seeing what happens.So, imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom.(Laughter)Or, sometimes I take them to placesthat people have never heard of because they're underwater.For instance, I took them skiing in the Mid-Atlantic Range,which is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic.I've taken them to the Sea of Japan,where they met giant jellyfish.I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California.This next one here,I did a story on the census of marine life.And that was a lot of fun because, as most of you know,it's a real project we've heard about.But it was a chance for me to introduce readersto a lot of crazy undersea characters.So we start off the story with Ernest,who volunteers as a census taker.He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish.Then he meets the yeti crab,the famous vampire squid -- elusive, hard to find --and the Dumbo octopus, which looks so much like a cartoon in real lifethat really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it.I did another story on marine debris.I was speaking to a lot of my friendsin the conservation business,and they --I asked them, "So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about?"And they said -- this one friend of mine said,"I've got one word for you: plastic."And I told him, "Well, I need something a little sexier than that.Plastic just is not going to do it."We sort of worked things out.He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride,which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well.I couldn't fit them in.So what I did was I made an adventure strip.Basically, this bottle travels a long way.What I'm trying to tell readersis that plastic doesn't really go away;it just continues to wash downstream.And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean,which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it,especially if they can't stand each other, like these two.So, I sent them to Boise, Idaho,where they dropped a plastic bottleinto the Boise sewer system.And it ended up in the Boise Riverand then on to the Columbia Riverand then to the mouth of the Columbiaand to the Pacific Oceanand then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch --which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific,where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around --and then back onto the lagoon.So that was basically a buddy storywith a plastic bottle following along.So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway,but we really talked about marine debris and plasticin the course of that one.The third storyline I did about a year and a half agowas probably my most difficult.It was on shark finning, and I felt really stronglyabout this issue.And I felt like, since my main character was a shark,the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this.Now, finning is the actof taking a shark, cutting the valuable fins offand throwing the live animal back in the water.It's cruel, it's wasteful.There's nothing funny or entertaining about it,but I really wanted to take this issue on.I had to kill my main character, who is a shark.We start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant,who gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler,which he does.And then he dies.He gets finned, and then he gets thrown overboard.Ostensibly, he's dead now.And so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for 15 years.So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one.Meanwhile, the other characters are talking about shark fin soup.I do three or four strips after thatwhere we explore the finning issueand the shark fin soup issue.Sherman's up in shark heaven.This is what I love about comic strips, you know.You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbeliefbecause, if you start with a talking shark,readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door.You can kind of do anything.It becomes a near-death experience for Sherman.Meanwhile, Ernest finds his fins on the internet.There was a real website based in Chinathat actually sold shark fins,so I kind of exposed that.And he clicks the "buy now" button.And voila, next-day air, they show up,and they surgically reattach them.I ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petitionthat encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service,to force other countriesto have a stronger stance with shark management.(Applause)Thanks.I'd like to end with a little metaphor here.I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue,and this is what I came up with.Imagine you're in an enormous room,and it's as dark as a cave.And you can have anything in that room, anything you want,but you can't see anything.You've been given one tool, a hammer.So you wander around in the darkness, and you bump into something,and it feels like it's made of stone.It's big, it's heavy. You can't carry it away,so you bang it with your hammer, and you break off a piece.And you take the piece out into the daylight.And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster.So you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something."So you go back into the room,and you break this thing to pieces, and you haul it away.And you find other things, and you break that up, and you haul those away.And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff.And you hear other people doing the same thing.So you get this sense of urgency,like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible.And then some yells, "Stop!"And they turn up the lights.And you realize where you are; you're in the Louvre.And you've taken all this complexity and beauty,and you've turned it into a cheap commodity.And that's what we're doing with the ocean.And part of what Mission Blue is aboutis yelling, "Stop!"so that each of us --explorer, scientist, cartoonist, singer, chef --can turn up the lights in their own way.And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way.That's why I like what I do.Thanks for listening.(Applause)



seth_priebatsch_the_game_layer_on_top_of_the_world

I'm a proud Princeton dropout.where I actually grew up.(Applause) Yeah, Boston.a game layer on top of the world.but that's not quite true,And it looks like this right now.It's not very good. It's cluttered.coupon cards and all these loyalty schemesthey just suck.They're not very well-designed.(Laughter)So that's unfortunate.are game dynamics themselves.four really important game dynamics,you can use to influence behavior,both for good, for bad, for in-between.Hopefully for good.Why is this important?I'm making this claimhas been this framework for connections,There's still a lot to explore,but the framework itself is done,and it's called Facebook.I like it quite a lot.and they own all of our connections.They own half a billion people.And if you're happy with that, fantastic.And that's a real thing.and makes it productive down the road.The game layer is all about influence.and connecting you to other peopleeverywhere you are and everywhere you go,how you do it.That's really, really powerful.while it's just getting constructed,that we think about it very consciously,and can be leveraged for good.because construction has just begun,is not with glass and steel and cement.that we have.The resources are mindshare,Back at SCVNGR, we like to jokeToday, I'm going to show you four,(Laughter)It's called the appointment dynamic.It's a dynamic in which to succeed,generally at a predefined place.that will manipulate how I interact:what I do, where I do it, when I do it."can be frightening.so you can rationalize it a bit;I think everything is a game,or on a computer screen;and one of how it can be used for good,is something called, "Happy Hour."get your drinks half off.This game dynamic is so powerful,That's a really scary thought,If you haven't, I recommend playing it.It's incredibly powerful,to water your fake crops, or they wilt.when they say your crops wiltthey could make it a 30-minute cycle,and no one could do anything else, right?(Laughter)That's a little scary.But this could also be used for good.This local company called VitalityThat's an appointment.You should get points for doing it on timeand lose points for not doing it on time.and leverage the games.We're going to jump onto the next one.Influence and status.It's used in your wallets, right now.And you see someone at CVS or --not CVS -- like, Christian Dior --(Laughter)(Laughter)and I need that."And this is used in games as well.because they've got that cool red badge,And that's very powerful to me.Status is really good motivator.and can be used more consciously there.(Laughter)(Applause)So school is a game,But let's use it consciously.That sucks. Why not level-up?and you level up from B to an A.And it's very powerful.It can be used in interesting ways.in a very granular fashion.where I am an unwhole individual.I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn,and that bothers me.And this is so deep-seated in our psycheWe will find a way to move that blue lineI mean, this is a Paladin level 10,and that's a Paladin level 20.against the Ra's Al Ghul,I would.And so people work very hard to level-up.One of the things we work on at SCVNGR is:And here, we have a game that people play.engaging with the business,and unlock rewards.creates loyalty, creates engagement,is this concept of communal discovery,Communal discovery is powerfulto solve problems.which I'm sure you've all heard of.Digg is a communal dynamicAnd they made this into a game, initially.you would get points.recommending people's stories.So we have to use this one carefully.This is the DARPA balloon challenge,and the winner will get $40,000."The winner was a group out of MIT,all across the country.Really powerful dynamic.And so, I've got about 20 seconds left,last decade was the decade of social.This next decade is the decade of games.We can influence behavior.It's very powerful. It's very exciting.(Applause)

I was one of the founding membersof the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.The other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed,who is an Egyptian-American,who actually had the idea to go to the Middle East and try it out.Before we went out as a tour,he went out solo and did it first.Then there was Aron Kader, who was the Palestinian-American.And then there was me, the Iranian-American of the group.Now, being Iranian-Americanpresents its own set of problems, as you know.Those two countries aren't getting along these days.So it causes a lot of inner conflict, you know,like part of me likes me, part of me hates me.Part of me thinks I should have a nuclear program,the other part thinks I can't be trusted with one.These are dilemmas I have every day.But I was born in Iran; I'm now an American citizen,which means I have the American passport,which means I can travel.Because if you only have the Iranian passport,you're kind of limited to the countries you can go towith open arms, you know --Syria, Venezuela, North Korea.(Laughter)So anyone who's gotten their passport in Americawill tell you, when you get your passport,it still says what country you were born in.So I remember getting my American passport.I was like, "Woohoo! I'm going to travel."And I opened it up, it said, "Born in Iran." I'm like, "Oh, come on, man."(Laughter)"I'm trying to go places."But what's interesting is, I've never had troubletraveling in any other Western countries with my American passport,even though it says, "Born in Iran." No problems.Where I've had some problems is some of the Arab countries,because I guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either.And so I was in Kuwait recently,doing a comedy show with some other American comedians.They all went through, and then the border patrol saw my American passport."Ah ha! American, great."Then he opened it up. "Born in Iran? Wait."(Laughter)And he started asking me questions.He said, "What is your father's name?"I said, "Well, he's passed away, but his name was Khosro."He goes, "What is your grandfather's name?"I said, "He passed away a long time ago.His name was Jabbar."He says, "You wait. I'll be back," and he walked away.And I started freaking out,because I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into.(Laughter)Thought the guy was going to come back and be like,"We've been looking for you for 200 years."(Laughter)"Your grandfather has a parking violation. It's way overdue.You owe us two billion dollars."But as you can see, when I talk,I speak with an American accent, which you would thinkas an Iranian-American actor,I should be able to play any part, good, bad, what have you.But a lot of times in Hollywood,when casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent,they go, "Oh, you're Iranian. Great.Can you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah?'""I could say that, but what if I were to say,'Hello. I'm your doctor?'"They go, "Great. And then you hijack the hospital."(Laughter)Like I think you're missing the point here.Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys.I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank.I want to rob a bank in a film. I want to rob a bank in a film,but do it with a gun, with a gun, not with a bomb strapped around me, right.(Laughter)Because I imagine the director: "Maz, I think your characterwould rob the bank with a bomb around him.""Why would I do that?If I want the money, why would I kill myself?"(Laughter)Right.(Applause)"Gimme all your money, or I'll blow myself up."(Laughter)"Well, then blow yourself up.Just do it outside, please."(Laughter)But the fact is, there's good people everywhere.That's what I try and show in my stand-up. There's good people everywhere.All it takes in one person to mess it up.Like a couple months ago in Times Square in New York,there was this Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb.Now, I happened to be in Times Square that nightdoing a comedy show.And a few months before that, there was a white American guy in Austin, Texaswho flew his airplane into the IRS building,and I happened to be in Austin that daydoing a stand-up comedy show.Now I'll tell you, as a Middle Eastern male,when you show up around a lot of these activities,you start feeling guilty at one point.I was watching the news. I'm like, "Am I involved in this crap?"(Laughter)"I didn't get the memo. What's going on?"(Laughter)But what was interesting was, the Pakistani Muslim guy --see he gives a bad name to Muslimsand Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world.And one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Talibantook credit for that failed car bombing.My question is: why would you take creditfor a failed car bombing?"We just wanted to saywe tried."(Laughter)"And furthermore,it is the thought that counts."(Laughter)(Applause)"And in conclusion, win some, lose some."(Laughter)But what happened was, when the white guy flew his plane into the building,I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the Stateswere watching TV, going, "Please, don't be Middle Eastern.Don't be Hassan. Don't be Hussein."And the name came out Jack. I'm like, "Woooo!That's not one of us."But I kept watching the news in case they came back,they were like, "Before he did it, he converted to Islam.""Damn it! Why Jack? Why?"But the fact is, I've been luckyto get a chance to perform all over the world,and I did a lot of shows in the Middle East.I just did a seven-country solo tour.I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.I was in Dubai.And it's great, there's good people everywhere.And you learn great things about these places.I encourage people always to go visit these places.For example, Dubai -- cool place.They're obsessed with having the biggest, tallest, longest, as we all know.They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.It is so big, they have taxis in the mall.I was walking. I heard "Beep, beep."I'm like, "What are you doing here?"He goes, "I'm going to the Zara store. It's three miles away.Out of my way. Out of my way. Out of my way."And what's crazy -- there's a recession going on, even in Dubai,but you wouldn't know by the prices.Like in the Dubai Mall,they sell frozen yogurt by the gram.It's like a drug deal.I was walking by. The guy goes, "Psst. Habibi, my friend."(Laughter)"You want some frozen yogurt?Come here. Come here. Come here.I have one gram, five gram, 10 gram. How many gram do you want?"(Laughter)I bought five grams. 10 dollars. 10 dollars! I said, "What's in this?"He's like, "Good stuff, man. Columbian. Top of the line. Top of the line."The other thing you learn sometimeswhen you travel to these countries in the Middle East,sometimes in Latin American countries, South American countries --a lot of times when they build stuff,there's no rules and regulations.For example, I took my two year-old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall.And I've taken my two year-old son to playgrounds all over the United States.And when you put your two year-old on a slide in the United States,they put something on the slideto slow the kid down as he comes down the slide.Not in the Middle East.(Laughter)I put my two year-old on the slide; he went frrmrmm! He took off.I went down. I go, "Where's my son?""On the third floor, sir. On the third floor."(Laughter)"You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left."(Laughter)"Try the yogurt. It's very good. Little expensive."But one of the things I try to do with my stand-up is to break stereotypes.And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well.I was in Dubai. And there's a lot of Indians who work in Dubai.And they don't get paid that well.And I got it in my head that all the Indians there must be workers.And I forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai as well.I was doing a show,and they said, "We're going to send a driver to pick you up."So I went down to the lobby, and I saw this Indian guy.I go, "He's got to be my driver."Because he was standing there in like a cheap suit, thin mustache, staring at me.So I went over, "Excuse me, sir, are you my driver?"He goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel."(Laughter)I go, "I'm sorry. Then why were you staring at me?"He goes, "I thought you were my driver."(Applause)(Laughter)I'll leave you guys with this: I try, with my stand-up, to break stereotypes,present Middle Easterners in a positive light -- Muslims in a positive light --and I hope that in the coming years,more film and television programs come out of Hollywoodpresenting us in a positive light.Who knows, maybe one day we'll even have our own James Bond, right."My name is Bond, Jamal Bond."(Laughter)Til then, I'll keep telling jokes. I hope you keep laughing.Have a good day. Thank you.(Applause)

This talk is about righting writing wrongs.No, the sound's not faulty -- righting writing wrongs.The Middle East is huge,and with all our problems, one thing's for sure: we love to laugh.I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences.We need to take our responsibilities seriously,but not ourselves.Don't get me wrong: it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East.I grew up at a time when iconic actorsfrom Kuwait, Syria, Egyptused laughter to unite the region,just as football can.(Laughter)Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves,before others can laugh with us.This is the story of the rise and rise of stand-up comedy in the Middle East --a stand-up uprising, if you will.Working in London as TV maker and writer,I quickly realizedthat comedy connects audiences.Now, the best breeding ground for good comic writingis the stand-up comedy circuit,where they just happen to say that you kill when you do welland you bomb when you do badly.An unfortunate connection for us maybe,but it reminds methat we'd like to thank one man for, over the past decade,working tirelesslyto support comedians all around the world,specifically comedianswith a Middle Eastern background.(Applause)Like my good friends, Dean and Maysoon, at the bottom of the screen,who, two years after 9/11,started a festival to change the wayMiddle Easterners are perceived in the world.It's still going strong, with positive press to die for.Also, three guys working for years in Los Angeles,an Iranian, a Palestinian and an Egyptian,created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act.And wherever they went,they killed.Now, I didn't start this fire, but I did pour petrol on it.I moved to Dubai as the head of original contentfor a Western TV network.My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience.Now, the American head of programmingwanted new local Arabic comedy.In a thick Arabic accent, my brain went,"Berfect."(Laughter)Now, I had friends in the U.S.who had started a successful new tribe.And I had every intention of taking this tribefrom being outliers in the Middle Eastand pushing them over the tipping pointtowards success.Now, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.I had four phases to this plan.First, we'd need to buy content from the West and air it.Then I'd bring my friends, and we'd show local amateurs how it's done.We would film that and air it,and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy.I excitedly presented this to the big boss,and his reaction was, "Um, I don't get it."So I retreated back to my caveand continued to support and produce comedyand let my friends use my couchas a regional operations hub.Now, fast forward two years, to early 2007.The earth rotated, as did our management,(Laughter)and as if by divine intervention,things came togetherto help this revolution take shape.Here's how the dots connected.First, the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central specialthat aired in the States,and it was getting great hits on YouTube.Our new French CEObelieved in the power of positive PR ...(Laughter)and ideas du bon marche.Let's just say "value for money."I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmedto showcase his new Axis special to a packed room.I invited our new CEO,and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels,his reaction was very simple:"Let's make this happen.And one more thing: No, don't F it up."So I quickly went to workwith a great team around me.I happened to finda funny guy to present it in Arabic,who is originally Korean,a perfect fit for the Axis of Evil.This is all true.Now, while preparing for the tour,I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive.I used the three Bs of stand-up don'tsas I call them in the Middle East:blue content, keep it clean; beliefs, not religion;and the third B, bolitics.Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East.Oh course, you might think, what's leftwithout bolitics, sex and religion, how can you make people laugh?I'd say, watch any successful well-written,family-friendly sitcom in the Westfor your answers.Now, were the Axis successful?In five countries, in just under a month,we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live.We had millions see them on TV and on TV news.In Jordan, we had His Majesty the King come and see them.In fact, they were so successfulthat you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD,even before it was released in the Middle East.Anywhere you go.So everywhere we went,we auditioned amateurs.We filmed that process and aired a documentary.I called it "Three Guys and Wonho."It really is his name.And all this TV and Internet exposurehas led to a great manyrecruits to our cause.In Dubai this year, we've just hadthe first all-women's, homegrown stand-up show.And notice two of them are wearing headscarves,and yes, even they can laugh.Dubai, to me, is like a handthat supports anyone who wants to make things happen.20 years ago,no one had heard of it.Look at it now.With an inspirational leader, I think this year,the opening of the tallest tower in the worldis like adding a finger to that hand,that points at all thosewho spread fallacious stories about us.(Laughter)(Applause)Now, in three short years, we've come a long waywith stand-up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia.These comics are now going to the New York festival.And the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese,Nemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour,has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs.So clearly, from the inside, we are doing our best to change our image,and it's exploding.(Laughter)So, as for the outsiders looking in,watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival.The reporter did a great job, and I thank her,but somebody forgot to send the positive PR emailto the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom.For example, when Dean talks,the ticker says, "U.S.: Suspect gave 'actionable intel."Well, if you're used to listening to comedians,then I'm not surprised.Sadly, this leads me to another three Bsthat represents how the media in the Westtalks about us as bombers, billionairesand belly dancers.Enough.We're not all angry fanaticswho want to kill the infidel.We have a positive story to telland image to sell.In fact, one thing's for sure, in my experience,we love to laugh like hell.(Laughter)Here are three questions that I like to useto test the truthiness of our representationin any media story.One: Is the Middle Eastbeing shown in a current timeand correct context?(Laughter)Two: Do the Middle Eastern characterslaugh or smilewithout showing the whites of their eyes?(Laughter)Three: Is the Middle Eastern characterbeing played by one?Clearly, there are wrongs that need to be righted.We've started in our region.My challenge to the rest of the worldis please, start usingpositive Middle Eastern images in your stories.For inspiration, go to one of our festivals,go online, drop us a line.Let's change the narrative togetherand let's start righting writing wrongs.I'd like to end, before going back to the Middle East,with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhsto put quill to parchment.As my father likes to call him, "Asheikh Azubare;"as my mother would say, "Shakespeare."(Laughter)"And now we go in contentto liberty and not to banishment."Thank you.(Applause)

Up until now, our communication with machineshas always been limitedto conscious and direct forms.Whether it's something simplelike turning on the lights with a switch,or even as complex as programming robotics,we have always had to give a command to a machine,or even a series of commands,in order for it to do something for us.Communication between people, on the other hand,is far more complex and a lot more interestingbecause we take into accountso much more than what is explicitly expressed.We observe facial expressions, body language,and we can intuit feelings and emotionsfrom our dialogue with one another.This actually forms a large partof our decision-making process.Our vision is to introducethis whole new realm of human interactioninto human-computer interactionso that computers can understandnot only what you direct it to do,but it can also respondto your facial expressionsand emotional experiences.And what better way to do thisthan by interpreting the signalsnaturally produced by our brain,our center for control and experience.Well, it sounds like a pretty good idea,but this task, as Bruno mentioned,isn't an easy one for two main reasons:First, the detection algorithms.Our brain is made up ofbillions of active neurons,around 170,000 kmof combined axon length.When these neurons interact,the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse,which can be measured.The majority of our functional brainis distributed overthe outer surface layer of the brain,and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity,the brain surface is highly folded.Now this cortical foldingpresents a significant challengefor interpreting surface electrical impulses.Each individual's cortexis folded differently,very much like a fingerprint.So even though a signalmay come from the same functional part of the brain,by the time the structure has been folded,its physical locationis very different between individuals,even identical twins.There is no longer any consistencyin the surface signals.Our breakthrough was to create an algorithmthat unfolds the cortex,so that we can map the signalscloser to its source,and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.The second challengeis the actual device for observing brainwaves.EEG measurements typically involvea hairnet with an array of sensors,like the one that you can see here in the photo.A technician will put the electrodesonto the scalpusing a conductive gel or pasteand usually after a procedure of preparing the scalpby light abrasion.Now this is quite time consumingand isn't the most comfortable process.And on top of that, these systemsactually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.So with that, I'd like to invite onstageEvan Grant, who is one of last year's speakers,who's kindly agreedto help me to demonstratewhat we've been able to develop.(Applause)So the device that you seeis a 14-channel, high-fidelityEEG acquisition system.It doesn't require any scalp preparation,no conductive gel or paste.It only takes a few minutes to put onand for the signals to settle.It's also wireless,so it gives you the freedom to move around.And compared to the tens of thousands of dollarsfor a traditional EEG system,this headset only costsa few hundred dollars.Now on to the detection algorithms.So facial expressions --as I mentioned before in emotional experiences --are actually designed to work out of the boxwith some sensitivity adjustmentsavailable for personalization.But with the limited time we have available,I'd like to show you the cognitive suite,which is the ability for youto basically move virtual objects with your mind.Now, Evan is new to this system,so what we have to do firstis create a new profile for him.He's obviously not Joanne -- so we'll "add user."Evan. Okay.So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suiteis to start with traininga neutral signal.With neutral, there's nothing in particularthat Evan needs to do.He just hangs out. He's relaxed.And the idea is to establish a baselineor normal state for his brain,because every brain is different.It takes eight seconds to do this,and now that that's done,we can choose a movement-based action.So Evan, choose somethingthat you can visualize clearly in your mind.Evan Grant: Let's do "pull."Tan Le: Okay, so let's choose "pull."So the idea here nowis that Evan needs toimagine the object coming forwardinto the screen,and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screenwhile he's doing that.The first time, nothing will happen,because the system has no idea how he thinks about "pull."But maintain that thoughtfor the entire duration of the eight seconds.So: one, two, three, go.Okay.So once we accept this,the cube is live.So let's see if Evancan actually try and imagine pulling.Ah, good job!(Applause)That's really amazing.(Applause)So we have a little bit of time available,so I'm going to ask Evanto do a really difficult task.And this one is difficultbecause it's all about being able to visualize somethingthat doesn't exist in our physical world.This is "disappear."So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions,we do that all the time, so you can visualize it.But with "disappear," there's really no analogies --so Evan, what you want to do hereis to imagine the cube slowly fading out, okay.Same sort of drill. So: one, two, three, go.Okay. Let's try that.Oh, my goodness. He's just too good.Let's try that again.EG: Losing concentration.(Laughter)TL: But we can see that it actually works,even though you can only hold itfor a little bit of time.As I said, it's a very difficult processto imagine this.And the great thing about it is thatwe've only given the software one instanceof how he thinks about "disappear."As there is a machine learning algorithm in this --(Applause)Thank you.Good job. Good job.(Applause)Thank you, Evan, you're a wonderful, wonderfulexample of the technology.So, as you can see, before,there is a leveling system built into this softwareso that as Evan, or any user,becomes more familiar with the system,they can continue to add more and more detections,so that the system begins to differentiatebetween different distinct thoughts.And once you've trained up the detections,these thoughts can be assigned or mappedto any computing platform,application or device.So I'd like to show you a few examples,because there are many possible applicationsfor this new interface.In games and virtual worlds, for example,your facial expressionscan naturally and intuitively be usedto control an avatar or virtual character.Obviously, you can experience the fantasy of magicand control the world with your mind.And also, colors, lighting,sound and effectscan dynamically respond to your emotional stateto heighten the experience that you're having, in real time.And moving on to some applicationsdeveloped by developers and researchers around the world,with robots and simple machines, for example --in this case, flying a toy helicoptersimply by thinking "lift" with your mind.The technology can also be appliedto real world applications --in this example, a smart home.You know, from the user interface of the control systemto opening curtainsor closing curtains.And of course, also to the lighting --turning them onor off.And finally,to real life-changing applications,such as being able to control an electric wheelchair.In this example,facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands.Man: Now blink right to go right.Now blink left to turn back left.Now smile to go straight.TL: We really -- Thank you.(Applause)We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today,and with the community's input,and also with the involvement of developersand researchers from around the world,we hope that you can help us to shapewhere the technology goes from here. Thank you so much.

So, these arethe Dark Ages.And the Dark Ages are the time betweenwhen you put away the Legofor the last time as a kid,and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy.Started out with my then four-year-old:"Oh, should buy the kid some Lego.That stuff's cool."Walked into the Lego store.Bought him this.It's totally appropriate for a four-year-old.(Laughter)I think the box says --let's see here --"8 to 12" on it.I turn to my wife and said, "Who are we buying this for?"She's like, "Oh, us." I'm like, "Okay. All right. That's cool."Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control.The dining room looked like this.You walk there, and it hurts.So we took a room downstairs in the basementthat had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex.(Laughter)Torture, very funny.Wow, you guys are great.And we put down those little floor tiles,and then I went onto eBayand bought 150 pounds of Lego --(Laughter)which is insane.My daughter -- the day we got it, I was tucking her in --and I said,"Honey, you're my treasure."And she said, "No, the Lego is the treasure."(Laughter)And then she said, "Dad, we're Lego rich."I was like, "Yeah.I suppose we are."So then once you do thatyou're like, "Oh, crap. Where am I going to put all this?"So you go to The Container Storeand spend an enormous amount of money,and then you start this crazy sorting processthat never --it's just nuts.Whatever.So then you realize there are these conventions.And you go to one of these conventions, and some dude built the Titanic.And you're like, "Holy shit!He had to come in like a truck,a semi, with this thing."And then someone built this -- this is the Smith Tower in Seattle.Just beautiful.And there's a dude selling theseaftermarket weapons for Lego,because Lego -- the Danish --no, they're not into guns.But the Americans? Oh, we'll make some guns for Lego, no problem.And at a certain point, you look around,you're like, "Whoa, this is a really nerdy crowd."And I mean like this is a nerdy crowd,but that's like a couple of levels above furries.(Laughter)The nerds here, they get laid --except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket --and you say to yourself at some point,"Am I part of this group? Like, am I into this?"And I was just like, "Yeah, I guess I am.I'm coming out.I'm kind of into this stuff, and I'm going to stop being embarrassed."So then you really get into it,and you're like, "Well, the Lego people in Denmark, they've got all this softwareto let you build your own virtually."And so this is like this CAD program where you build it.And then whatever you design virtually,you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later.And then some of the designs that people dothey actually sell in the store.The Lego guys don't give you any royalties, strangely,but some user made this and then it sold.And it's pretty amazing actually.Then you notice that if thatLego-provided CAD program isn't enough,there's an entire open-source, third-party,independent Lego CAD programthat lets you do 3D modelingand 3D renderingand make, in fact, movies out of Lego,3D filmsof which there are thousands on YouTube,and some of them sort of mimicking famous filmsand some totally original content --just beautiful --and people recreating all sorts of things.I have to take a moment.I love the guy who's like running awaywith his clasps, his hooks.Okay. Anyway.(Laughter)There's a whole programming language and robotics tool,so if you want to teach someone how to program,kid, adult, whatever it is.And the guy that made this,he made a slot machine out of Lego.And I don't mean he made Lego that looked like a slot machine;I mean he made a slot machine out of Lego.The insides were Lego.There's people getting drunk building Lego,and you've got to finish the thing before you puke.There's a whole gray market for Lego,thousands of home-based businesses.And some people will fund their entire Lego habitby selling the little guy,but then you have no guys in your ships.And then, just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture.This is amazing what you can do.And don't kid yourself:some architectural details, incredible organic shapesand just, even, nature out of, again, little blocks.This is my house.And this is my house.I was afraid a car was going to come smash itas I was taking a picture for you guys.Anyway, I'm out of time.But just very quickly --we'll just see if I can do this quick.Because there aren't enough TED logos around here.(Laughter)Let's see here.Okay.Ta-da.(Applause)

So, if you're in the audience today,or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place,you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem.Whether you're an artist, a technologist,a lawyer or a fan,the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.Rights management is no longersimply a question of ownership,it's a complex web of relationshipsand a critical part of our cultural landscape.YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners,but in order to give them choices about what they can dowith copies, mashups and more,we need to first identifywhen copyrighted material is uploaded to our site.Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works.Two years ago, recording artist Chris Brownreleased the official video of his single "Forever."A fan saw it on TV,recorded it with her camera phone,and uploaded it to YouTube.Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's videoin our Content ID system,within seconds of attempting to upload the video,the copy was detected,giving Sony the choice of what to do next.But how do we know that the user's video was a copy?Well, it starts with content ownersdelivering assets into our database,along with a usage policythat tells us what to do when we find a match.We compare each uploadagainst all of the reference files in our database.This heat map is going to show youhow the brain of the system works.Here we can see the original reference filebeing compared to the user generated content.The system compares every momentof one to the other to see if there's a match.This means that we can identify a matcheven if the copy used is just a portion of the original file,plays it in slow motionand has degraded audio and video quality.And we do this every timethat a video is uploaded to YouTube.And that's over 20 hours of video every minute.When we find a match,we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down.And the scale and the speed of this systemis truly breathtaking.We're not just talking about a few videos,we're talking about over100 years of video every day,between new uploads and the legacy scanswe regularly do across all of the content on the site.When we compare those hundred years of video,we're comparing it against millionsof reference files in our database.It would be like 36,000 peoplestaring at 36,000 monitorseach and every day, without so much as a coffee break.Now, what do we do when we find a match?Well, most rights owners, instead of blocking,will allow the copy to be published.And then they benefit through the exposure,advertising and linked sales.Remember Chris Brown's video "Forever"?Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts,and that looked like the end of the story,but sometime last year, a young couple got married.This is their wedding video.You may have seen it.(Music)What's amazing about this is,if the processional of the wedding was this much fun,can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been?I mean, who are these people?I totally want to go to that wedding.So their little wedding video went onto get over 40 million views.And instead of Sony blocking,they allowed the upload to occur.And they put advertising against itand linked from it to iTunes.And the song, 18 months old,went back to number four on the iTunes charts.So Sony is generating revenue from both of these.And Jill and Kevin, the happy couple,they came back from their honeymoonand found that their video had gone crazy viral.And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows,and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference.The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donationsto end domestic violence.The "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popularthat NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office,"which just goes to show,it's truly an ecosystem of culture.Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios,but sometimes big studios borrowing back.By empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity.And all it took to change things aroundwas to allow for choice through rights identification.So why has no one ever solved this problem before?It's because it's a big problem,and it's complicated and messy.It's not uncommon for a single videoto have multiple rights owners.There's musical labels.There's multiple music publishers.And each of these can vary by country.There's lots of caseswhere we have more than one work mashed together.So we have to manage many claimsto the same video.YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases.But the system only works throughthe participation of rights owners.If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube,you should register in the Content ID system,and then you'll have the choiceabout how your content is used.And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content.By simply blocking all reuse,you'll miss out on new art forms,new audiences,new distribution channelsand new revenue streams.But it's not just about dollars and impressions.Just look at all the joythat was spread through progressive rights managementand new technology.And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading.Thank you.(Applause)

Hi there.I'm going to be talking a little bit aboutmusic, machines and life.Or, more specifically,what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machinefor a music video.Some of you may recognize this image.This is the opening frame of the video that we created.We'll be showing the video at the end,but before we do, I want to talk a little bit aboutwhat it is that they wanted.Now, when we first started talking to OK Go --the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" --we were really excited becausethey expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.And we were very excited about thisbecause, of course,they have a history of dancing with machines.They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."50-million-plus views on YouTube.Four guys dancing on treadmills,no cuts, just a static camera.A fantastically viral and wonderful video.So we were really excited about working with them.And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.And they explained that they wantedkind of a Rube Goldberg machine.Now, for those of you who don't know,a Rube Goldberg machineis a complicated contraption,an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinerythat accomplishes a relatively simple task.So we were excited by this idea,and we started talking aboutexactly what it would look like.And we came up with some parameters, because,you know, building a Rube Goldberg machinehas limitations,but it also is pretty wide open.And we wanted to make sure that we did somethingthat would work for a music video.So we came up with a list of requirements,the "10 commandments,"and they were, in order of ascending difficulty:The first is "No magic."Everything that happened on screen had to bevery easily understood by a typical viewer.The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it,then we couldn't use it in the video.They wanted band integration,that is, the machine acting upon the band members,specifically not the other way around.They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.So as the song picks up emotion,so should the machineget grander in its process.They wanted us to make use of the space.So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using,divided between two floors.It included an exterior loading dock.We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floorthat we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.The machine itself would start the music.So the machine would get started,it would travel some distance,reacting along the way,hit play on an iPod or a tape deckor something that would start playback.And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.And speaking of synchronization,they wanted it to sync to the rhythmand to hit specific beats along the way.Okay. (Laughter)They wanted it to end precisely on time.Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.And they wanted the music to drop outat a certain point in the videoand actual live audio from the machineto play part of the song.And as if that wasn't enough,all of these incredibly complicating things, right,they wanted it in one shot.(Laughter)(Applause)Okay.So, just some statisticsabout what we went through in the process.The machine itself has89 distinct interactions.It took us 85 takesto get it on filmto our satisfaction.Of those 85 takes,only three actually successfully completed their run.We destroyed two pianosand 10 televisions in the process.We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.(Laughter)And we lost one high-heeled shoewhen one of our engineers, Heather Knight,left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner,and returned back to the build --and left it in a pile of stuff.And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use"and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.And it's actually in the machine.So what did we learn from all of this?Well, having completed this,we have the opportunity to step back and reflecton some of the things.And we learned that small stuff stinks.Little balls in wooden tracksare really susceptible tohumidity and temperature and a little bit of dust,and they fall out of the tracks,the exact angles makes it hard to get right.And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.It doesn't matter what temperature it is,doesn't matter what's in its way;it will pretty much get where it needs to go.But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start,so that we would have somewhere to go.And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it.Small stuff stinks,but, of course, it's essential, right?What else? Planning is incredibly important.(Laughter)You know, we spent a lot of time ideatingand even building some of these things.It's been said that, "No battle plansurvives contact with the enemy."I think our enemy was physics --(Laughter)and she's a cruel mistress.Often, we had to pull things out as a resultbecause of timing or aesthetics or whatever.And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.These are all things that ended upnot making it into the final machine.So also, put reliable stuff last,the stuff that's going to run every time.Again, small to large is relevant here.The little Lego car in the beginning of the videoreferences the big, real carnear the end of the video.The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.The little one had a tendency to try to run off the trackand that's a problem.But you don't want to have to reset the whole machinebecause the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.So you put that up front so that, if it fails,at least you knowyou don't have to reset the whole thing.Life can bemessy.There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.And the wonderful elation that we hadwhen we finally completed it.So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad,"This Too Shall Pass."Thank you very much.(Applause)And now to introducetheir music video,we have OK Go.OK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.We are OK Go.What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC.We are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?"I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.Let me start again.We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."Tim's sundial hat.Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?Sorry, start again.(Barking)Dogs.Hello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go,and this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass."[unclear]Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.That one's pretty good. It's getting better.(Music)♫ You know you can't keep letting it get you down ♫♫ And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around ♫♫ If there ain't all that much to lug around ♫♫ Better run like hell when you hit the ground ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫♫ You can't stop these kids from dancing ♫♫ Why would you want to? ♫♫ Especially when you're already getting yours ♫♫ Cuz if your mind don't move and your knees don't bend ♫♫ Well don't go blaming the kids again ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫♫ Let it go ♫♫ This too shall pass ♫♫ Let it go ♫♫ This too shall pass ♫♫ You know you can't keep letting it get you down ♫♫ No, you can't keep letting it get you down ♫♫ Let it go ♫♫ This too shall pass ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫♫ When the morning comes ♫(Cheering)

I've been playing TED for nearly a decade,and I've very rarely playedany new songs of my own.And that was largely because there weren't any.(Laughter)So I've been busy with a couple of projects,and one of them was this:The Nutmeg.A 1930s ship's lifeboat,which I've been restoring in the gardenof my beach house in England.And, so now,when the polar ice caps melt,my recording studio will rise up like an ark,and I'll float off into the drowned worldlike a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.During the day,the Nutmeg collects energyfrom solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse,and from a 450 watt turbineup the mast.So that when it gets dark,I've got plenty of power.And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning,and I work on new songs.I'd like to play to you guys,if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.(Applause)It's about Billie Holiday.And it appears that,some night in 1947she left her physical spaceand was missing all night,until she reappeared in the morning.But I know where she was.She was with me on my lifeboat.And she was hot.(Music)♫ Billie crept softly ♫♫ into my waking arms ♫♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫♫ Strange fruit for ♫♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫♫ Panic at the stage door ♫♫ of Carnegie Hall ♫♫ "Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL" ♫♫ Must have left the building ♫♫ body and soul ♫♫ On a creaky ♫♫ piano stool tonight ♫♫ as the moon is my ♫♫ only witness ♫♫ She was breathing ♫♫ in my ear ♫♫ "This time it's love" ♫♫ But love is a loaded pistol ♫♫ By daybreak she's gone ♫♫ Over the frozen river, home ♫♫ Me and Johnny Walker ♫♫ See in the new age ♫♫ alone ♫♫ Stay with me ♫♫ again tonight ♫♫ Billie, time, ♫♫ time is a wily trickster ♫♫ Still an echo ♫♫ in my heart says, ♫♫ "This time it's love" ♫(Applause)



lies_damned_lies_and_statistics_about_tedtalks
2116355

If you go on the TED website,you can currently find thereover a full week of TEDTalk videos,over 1.3 millionwords of transcriptsand millions of user ratings.And that's a huge amount of data.And it got me wondering:If you took all this dataand put it through statistical analysis,could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk?Could you createthe ultimate TEDTalk?(Laughter) (Applause)And also, could you createthe worst possible TEDTalkthat they would still let you get away with?To find this out, I looked at three things:I looked at the topic that you should choose,I looked at how you should deliver itand the visuals onstage.Now, with the topic: There's a whole range of topics you can choose,but you should choose wisely,because your topic strongly correlateswith how users will react to your talk.Now, to make this more concrete,let's look at the list of top 10 wordsthat statistically stick outin the most favorite TEDTalksand in the least favorite TEDTalks.So if you came hereto talk about how French coffeewill spread happiness in our brains,that's a go.(Laughter) (Applause)Whereas, if you wanted to talk aboutyour project involvingoxygen, girls, aircraft --actually, I would like to hear that talk, (Laughter)but statistics say it's not so good.Oh, well.If you generalize this,the most favorite TEDTalks are thosethat feature topics we can connect with,both easily and deeply,such as happiness, our own body,food, emotions.And the more technical topics,such as architecture, materials and, strangely enough, men,those are not good topics to talk about.How should you deliver your talk?TED is famous for keepinga very sharp eye on the clock,so they're going to hate mefor revealing this, because, actually,you should talk as long as they will let you. (Laughter)Because the most favorite TEDTalksare, on average, over 50 percent longerthan the least favorite ones.And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.comexcept if you want to have a talkthat's beautiful, inspiring or funny.Then, you should be brief. (Laughter) But other than that,talk until they drag you off the stage.(Laughter)Now, while ...(Applause)While you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.I found these rules out by comparing the statisticsof four-word phrasesthat appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalksas opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks.I'll give you three examples.First of all, I must, as a speaker,provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you,instead of saying what I can't have.Secondly, it's imperativethat you do not cite The New York Times.(Laughter)And finally, it's okay for the speaker -- that's the good news --to fake intellectual capacity.If I don't understand something, I can just say, "etc., etc."You'll all stay with me.It's perfectly fine.(Applause)Now, let's go to the visuals.The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker.And analysis shows if you want to beamong the most favorite TED speakers,you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average,make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-upthan the average TED speaker.Slides are okay, though you might consider going for props.And now the most important thing,that is the mood onstage.Color plays a very important role.Color closely correlateswith the ratings that talks get on the website.(Applause)For example, fascinating talkscontain a statistically high amountof exactly this blue color, (Laughter)much more than the average TEDTalk.Ingenious TEDTalks, much more this green color,etc., et.(Laughter) (Applause)Now, personally, I thinkI'm not the first one who has done this analysis,but I'll leave thisto your good judgment.So, now it's time to put it all togetherand design the ultimate TEDTalk.Now, since this is TEDActive,and I learned from my analysisthat I should actually give you something,I will not impose the ultimateor worst TEDTalk on you,but rather give you a tool to create your own.And I call this tool the TEDPad.(Laughter)And the TEDPad is a matrixof 100 specifically selected,highly curated sentencesthat you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk.You only have to make one decision,and that is: Are you going to use the white versionfor very good TEDTalks,about creativity, human genius?Or are you going to go with a black version,which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks,mostly about blogs,politics and stuff?So, download it and have fun with it.Now I hope you enjoy the session.I hope you enjoy designing your ownultimate and worst possible TEDTalks.And I hope some of you will be inspired for next yearto create this, which I really want to see.Thank you very much.(Applause) Thanks.



roz_savage_why_i_m_rowing_across_the_pacific
616550

Hi, my name is Roz Savageand I row across oceans.Four years ago, I rowed solo across the Atlantic,and since then, I've done two out of three stagesacross the Pacific,from San Francisco to Hawaiiand from Hawaii to Kiribati.And tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boatto fly back to Kiribatito continue with the third and final stageof my row across the Pacific.Cumulatively, I will have rowedover 8,000 miles,taken over three million oar strokesand spent more than 312 days aloneon the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat.This has given me a veryspecial relationship with the ocean.We have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.I feel a bit about it like I did abouta very strict math teacher that I once had at school.I didn't always like her, but I did respect her,and she taught me a heck of a lot.So today I'd like to share with yousome of my ocean adventuresand tell you a little bit about what they've taught me,and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessonsand apply them to this environmental challengethat we face right now.Now, some of you might be thinking,"Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower.Isn't she meant to be about this talland about this wideand maybe look a bit more like these guys?"You'll notice, they've all got something that I don't.Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards. (Laughter)And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean,I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard,and I hope that it remains that way.For a long time, I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure.The story that I told myself wasthat adventurers looked like this.I didn't look the part.I thought there were them and there were us,and I was not one of them.So for 11 years, I conformed.I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do.I was working in an office in Londonas a management consultant.And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me.But that kind of conditioningjust kept me there for so many years,until I reached my mid-30s and I thought,"You know, I'm not getting any younger.I feel like I've got a purpose in this life, and I don't know what it is,but I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it.So, fast forward a few years.I'd gone through some changes.To try and answer that question of,"What am I supposed to be doing with my life?"I sat down one dayand wrote two versions of my own obituary,the one that I wanted, a life of adventure,and the one that I was actually heading forwhich was a nice, normal, pleasant life,but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life.I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituaryand thinking, "Oh boy,I'm on totally the wrong track here.If I carry on living as I am now,I'm just not going to end up where I want to bein five years, or 10 years,or at the end of my life."I made a few changes,let go of some loose trappings of my old life,and through a bit of a leap of logic,decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean.(Laughter)The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua,it's about 3,000 miles,and it turned out to bethe hardest thing I had ever done.Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone,but what I'd sort of failed to notice was thatgetting out of your comfort zone is, by definition,extremely uncomfortable.And my timing was not great either:2005, when I did the Atlantic,was the year of Hurricane Katrina.There were more tropical storms in the North Atlanticthan ever before, since records began.And pretty early on,those storms started making their presence known.All four of my oars brokebefore I reached halfway across.Oars are not supposed to look like this.But what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean.Oars are your only means of propulsion.So I just had to look around the boatand figure out what I was going to useto fix up these oars so that I could carry on.So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tapeand splintered the boat hookto the oars to reinforce it.Then, when that gave out,I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seatand used those.And then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.I'd never been very good at fixing stuffwhen I was living my old life,but it's amazing how resourceful you can becomewhen you're in the middle of the oceanand there's only one way to get to the other side.And the oars kind of became a symbolof just in how many waysI went beyond what I thought were my limits.I suffered from tendinitis on my shouldersand saltwater sores on my bottom.I really struggled psychologically,totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge,realizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour,3,000 miles was going totake me a very, very long time.There were so many timeswhen I thought I'd hit that limit,but had no choice but to just carry onand try and figure out how I was going to get to the other sidewithout driving myself crazy.And eventually after103 days at sea,I arrived in Antigua.I don't think I've ever felt so happyin my entire life.It was a bit like finishing a marathonand getting out of solitary confinementand winning an Oscar all rolled into one.I was euphoric.And to see all the people coming out to greet meand standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering,I just felt like a movie star.It was absolutely wonderful.And I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge,the bigger the sense of achievementwhen you get to the end of it.So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-outto answer a few FAQs about ocean rowingthat might be going through your mind.Number one that I get asked: What do you eat?A few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eatmuch more unprocessed foods.So I grow my own beansprouts.I eat fruits and nut bars,a lot of nuts.And generally arrive about 30 pounds lighterat the other end.Question number two: How do you sleep?With my eyes shut. Ha-ha.I suppose what you mean is:What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping?Well, I plan my route so that I'm driftingwith the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping.On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 milesin the right direction.Worst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.That's a bad day at the office.What do I wear?Mostly, a baseball cap,rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown,depending on whether I went backwards overnight --and lots of sun lotion.Do I have a chase boat?No I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there.I don't see anybody for the whole timethat I'm at sea, generally.And finally: Am I crazy?Well, I leave that one up to you to judge.So, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?Well, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific.Well, I thought the Atlantic was big,but the Pacific is really, really big.I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.I don't know for sure that the Britsinvented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so:we are right in the middle,and we've cut the Pacific in halfand flung it to the far corners of the world.Whereas if you look in Google Earth,this is how the Pacific looks.It pretty much covers half the planet.You can just see a little bit of North America up hereand a sliver of Australia down there.It is really big --65 million square miles --and to row in a straight line across itwould be about 8,000 miles.Unfortunately, ocean rowboatsvery rarely go in a straight line.By the time I get to Australia,if I get to Australia,I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.So, because nobody in their straight mind would rowstraight past Hawaii without dropping in,I decided to cut this very big undertakinginto three segments.The first attempt didn't go so well.In 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drillthree times in 24 hours.A bit like being in a washing machine.Boat got a bit dinged up,so did I.I blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebodywith a bit of a hero complex decided thatthis damsel was in distress and needed saving.The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.I tried to tell them to go away.We had a bit of a battle of wills.I lost and got airlifted.Awful, really awful.It was one of the worst feelings of my life,as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopterand looked down at my trusty little boatrolling around in the 20 foot wavesand wondering if I would ever see her again.So I had to launch a very expensivesalvage operationand then wait another nine monthsbefore I could get back out onto the ocean again.But what do you do?Fall down nine times, get up 10.So, the following year, I set outand, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.But it was not without misadventure.My watermaker broke,only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.Powered by my solar panels,it sucks in saltwaterand turns it into freshwater.But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean,which is what happened to it.Fortunately, help was at hand.There was another unusual boat out thereat the same time, doing as I was doing,bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch,that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas,with an estimated 3.5 milliontons of trash in it,circulating at the center ofthat North Pacific Gyre.So, to make the point, these guyshad actually built their boat out of plastic trash,15,000 empty water bottleslatched together into two pontoons.They were going very slowly.Partly, they'd had a bit of a delay.They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beachbecause the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone,and they were starting to sink.So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up.But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves,luckily, our courses were converging.They were running out of food; I was running out of water.So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.And it took about a weekfor us to actually gradually converge.I was doing a pathetically slow speedof about 1.3 knots,and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4:it was like two snails in a mating dance.But, eventually, we did manage to meet upand Joel hopped overboard,caught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,which was the best food I'd hadin, ooh, at least three months.Fortunately, the one that he caught that daywas better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.When they opened this one up,they found its stomach was full of plastic.And this is really bad news because plasticis not an inert substance.It leaches out chemicalsinto the flesh of the poor critter that ate it,and then we come along and eat that poor critter,and we get some of the toxins accumulatingin our bodies as well.So there are very real implications for human health.I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.And, the following year, set outon the second stage of the Pacific,from Hawaii down to Tarawa.And you'll notice something about Tarawa;it is very low-lying.It's that little green sliver on the horizon,which makes them very nervousabout rising oceans.This is big trouble for these guys.They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.And also, as an increase in extremeweather events due to climate change,they're expecting more wavesto come in over the fringing reef,which will contaminate their fresh water supply.I had a meeting with the president there,who told me about hisexit strategy for his country.He expects that within the next 50 years,the 100,000 people that live therewill have to relocate toNew Zealand or Australia.And that made me think about how would I feelif Britain was going to disappear under the waves;if the places where I'd been bornand gone to schooland got married,if all those places were just going to disappear forever.How, literally, ungroundedthat would make me feel.Very shortly, I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia,and if I'm successful, I'll be the first woman ever to row soloall the way across the Pacific.And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues,to bring a human face to the ocean.If the Atlantic was about my inner journey,discovering my own capabilities,maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey,figuring out how I can usemy interesting career choiceto be of service to the world,and to take some of those things that I've learned out thereand apply them to the situationthat humankind now finds itself in.I think there are probably three key points here.The first one is aboutthe stories that we tell ourselves.For so long, I told myselfthat I couldn't have an adventurebecause I wasn't six foot talland athletic and bearded.And then that story changed.I found out that people had rowed across oceans.I even met one of them and she was just about my size.So even though I didn't grow any taller,I didn't sprout a beard,something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.At the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselvesis that we need all this stuff,that we need oil.But what about if we just change that story?We do have alternatives,and we have the power of free willto choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones,to create a greener future.The second point is aboutthe accumulation of tiny actions.We might think that anything that we do as an individualis just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference.But it does. Generally, we haven'tgot ourselves into this mess through big disasters.Yes, there have been the Exxon Valdezesand the Chernobyls,but mostly it's been an accumulationof bad decisionsby billions of individuals,day after day and year after year.And, by the same token, we can turn that tide.We can start making better,wiser, more sustainable decisions.And when we do that, we're not just one person.Anything that we do spreads ripples.Other people will see if you're in the supermarket lineand you pull out yourreusable grocery bag.Maybe if we all start doing this,we can make it socially unacceptableto say yes to plastic in the checkout line.That's just one example.This is a world-wide community.The other point:It's about taking responsibility.For so much of my life,I wanted something else to make me happy.I thought if I had the right house or the right caror the right man in my life,then I could be happy.But when I wrote that obituary exercise,I actually grew up a little bit in that momentand realized that I needed to create my own future.I couldn't just wait passivelyfor happiness to come and find me.And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.I plan on being around for a long time,and when I'm 90 years old,I want to be happy and healthy.And it's very difficult to be happyon a planet that's rackedwith famine and drought.It's very difficult to be healthy on a planetwhere we've poisoned the earthand the sea and the air.So, shortly, I'm going to belaunching a new initiativecalled Eco-Heroes.And the idea here is thatall our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.It's meant to be a bit of a game.We're going to make an iPhone app out of it.We just want to try and create that awarenessbecause, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world,but that attitude,that awareness that leads you to change the light bulbor take your reusable coffee mug,that is what could change the world.I really believe that we standat a very important point in history.We have a choice. We've been blessed,or cursed, with free will.We can choose a greener future,and we can get thereif we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time.Thank you.(Applause)



tom_wujec_build_a_tower

Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillmanintroduced a design challengecalled the marshmallow challenge.And the idea's pretty simple:Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structureout of 20 sticks of spaghetti,one yard of tape, one yard of stringand a marshmallow.The marshmallow has to be on top.And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hardbecause it forces peopleto collaborate very quickly.And so, I thought this was an interesting idea,and I incorporated it into a design workshop.And it was a huge success.And since then, I've conductedabout 70 design workshops across the worldwith students and designers and architects,even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,and there's something about this exercisethat reveals very deep lessonsabout the nature of collaboration,and I'd like to share some of them with you.So, normally, most people beginby orienting themselves to the task.They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,they jockey for power.Then they spend some time planning, organizing,they sketch and they lay out spaghetti.They spend the majority of their timeassembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.And then finally, just as they're running out of time,someone takes out the marshmallow,and then they gingerly put it on top,and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! --they admire their work.But what really happens, most of the time,is that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh,"because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structureto buckle and to collapse.So there are a number of peoplewho have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others,and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.(Laughter)They lie, they cheat, they get distractedand they produce really lame structures.And of course there are teamsthat have a lot more "ta-da" structures,and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.(Laughter)And it's pretty amazing.As Peter tells us,not only do they produce the tallest structures,but they're the most interesting structures of them all.So the question you want to ask is:How come? Why? What is it about them?And Peter likes to say thatnone of the kids spend any timetrying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?They don't spend time jockeying for power.But there's another reason as well.And the reason is that business students are trainedto find the single right plan, right?And then they execute on it.And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,they run out of time and what happens?It's a crisis.Sound familiar? Right.What kindergarteners do differentlyis that they start with the marshmallow,and they build prototypes, successive prototypes,always keeping the marshmallow on top,so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.Designers recognize this type of collaborationas the essence of the iterative process.And with each version, kids get instant feedbackabout what works and what doesn't work.So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,but let's look at how different teams perform.So the average for most people is around 20 inches;business schools students, about half of that;lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,kindergarteners, better than most adults.Who does the very best?Architects and engineers, thankfully.(Laughter)Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.And why is it? Because they understand trianglesand self-reinforcing geometrical patternsare the key to buildingstable structures.So CEOs, a little bit better than average,but here's where it gets interesting.If you put you put an executive admin. on the team,they get significantly better.(Laughter)It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win."You can just tell beforehand. And why is that?Because they have special skillsof facilitation.They manage the process, they understand the process.And any team who managesand pays close attention to workwill significantly improve the team's performance.Specialized skills and facilitation skillsare the combination that leads to strong success.If you have 10 teams that typically perform,you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.And I tried something interesting.I thought, let's up the ante, once.So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.So what do you think happened to these design students?What was the result?Here's what happened:Not one team had a standing structure.If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,they would have taken home the prize.So, isn't that interesting? That high stakeshave a strong impact.We did the exercise again with the same students.What do you think happened then?So now they understand the value of prototyping.So the same team went from being the very worstto being among the very best.They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.So there's deep lessons for usabout the nature of incentives and success.So, you might ask: Why would anyoneactually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?And the reason is, I help createdigital tools and processesto help teams build cars and video gamesand visual effects.And what the marshmallow challenge doesis it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.Because, frankly,every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it?The challenge provides a shared experience,a common language,a common stance to build the right prototype.And so, this is the value of the experience,of this so simple exercise.And those of you who are interestedmay want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.It's a blog that you can look athow to build the marshmallows.There's step-by-step instructions on this.There are crazy examples from around the worldof how people tweak and adjust the system.There's world records that are on this as well.And the fundamental lesson, I believe,is that design truly isa contact sport.It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,and that we apply the very best of our thinking,our feeling and our doingto the challenge that we have at hand.And sometimes, a little prototype of this experienceis all that it takes to turn usfrom an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment.And that can make a big difference.Thank you very much.(Applause)

The brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy,wrote a volume called"People Who Led to My Plays."And if I were to write a volume,it would be called,"Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions"because my work,in understanding art and in understanding culture,has come by following artists,by looking at what artists meanand what they do and who they are.J.J. from "Good Times,"(Applause)significant to many people of coursebecause of "Dy-no-mite,"but perhaps more significantas the first, really, black artiston primetime TV.Jean-Michel Basquiat,important to me because [he was]the first black artist in real timethat showed me the possibility ofwho and what I was about to enter into.My overall project is about art --specifically, about black artists --very generallyabout the way in which artcan change the way we thinkabout culture and ourselves.My interest is in artistswho understand and rewrite history,who think about themselveswithin the narrativeof the larger world of art,but who have created new placesfor us to see and understand.two of many who really form for methe essential questions that I wanted to bringas a curator to the world.I was interested in the ideaof why and howI could create a new story,a new narrative in art historyand a new narrative in the world.And to do this, I knewthat I had to see the way in which artists work,understand the artist's studioas a laboratory,imagine, then,reinventing the museum as a think tankand looking at the exhibitionas the ultimate white paper -- asking questions,providing the spaceto look and to think about answers.In 1994,when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum,I made an exhibition called Black Male.It looked at the intersectionof race and genderin contemporary American art.It sought to expressthe ways in which artcould provide a space for dialogue --complicated dialogue,dialogue with many, many points of entry --and how the museum could be the spacefor this contest of ideas.This exhibition includedover 20 artistsof various ages and races,but all looking at black masculinityfrom a very particular point of view.What was significant about this exhibitionis the way in whichit engaged me in my roleas a curator, as a catalyst,for this dialogue.One of the things that happenedvery distinctly in the course of this exhibitionis I was confronted with the ideaof how powerful images can beI'm showing you two works, one on the right by Leon Golub,one on the left by Robert Colescott.And in the course of the exhibition --which was contentious, controversialand ultimately, for me,life-changingin my sense of what art could be --a woman came up to me on the gallery floorto express her concern about the natureof how powerful images could beand how we understood each other.And she pointed to the work on the leftto tell me how problematic this image was,as it related, for her, to the idea ofhow black people had been represented.And she pointed to the image on the rightas an example, to me, of the kind of dignitythat needed to be portrayedto work against those images in the media.She then assigned these works racial identities,basically saying to me that the work on the right,clearly, was made by a black artist,the work on the left, clearly, by a white artist,when, in effect,that was the opposite case:Bob Colescott, African-American artist;Leon Golub, a white artist.The point of that for me wasto say -- in that space, in that moment --that I really, more than anything,wanted to understandhow images could work, how images did work,and how artists provideda space bigger than onethat we could imagine in our day-to-day livesto work through these images.Fast-forward and I end up in Harlem;home for many of black America,very much the psychic heartof the black experience,really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed.Harlem now, sort of explainingand thinking of itself in this part of the century,looking both backwards and forwards ...I always say Harlem is an interesting communitybecause, unlike many other places,it thinks of itself in the past, presentand the future simultaneously;no one speaks of it just in the now.It's always what it was and what it can be.And, in thinking about that,then my second project, the second question I ask is:Can a museumbe a catalyst in a community?Can a museum house artistsand allow them to be change agentsas communities rethink themselves?This is Harlem, actually, on January 20th,thinking about itself in a very wonderful way.So I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem,thinking about exhibitions there,thinking about what it means todiscover art's possibility.Now, what does this mean to some of you?In some cases, I know that many of youare involved in cross-cultural dialogues,you're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation.Think about the place that artists can play in that --that is the kind of incubation and advocacythat I work towards, in working with young, black artists.Think about artists, not as content providers,though they can be brilliant at that,but, again, as real catalysts.The Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s.And I bring this up because it's important to locatethis practice in history.To look at 1968,in the incredible historic moment that it is,and think of the arc that has happened since then,to think of the possibilities that we are allprivileged to stand in todayand imagine that this museumthat came out of a moment of great protestand one that was so much aboutexamining the history and the legacyof important African-American artiststo the history of art in this countrylike Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis,Romare Bearden.And then, of course,to bring us to today.In 1975, Muhammad Aligave a lecture at Harvard University.After his lecture, a student got up and said to him,"Give us a poem."And Mohammed Ali said, "Me, we."A profound statement about the individual and the community.The space in which now,in my project of discovery, of thinking about artists,of trying to definewhat might beblack art cultural movement of the 21st century.What that might meanfor cultural movements all over this moment,the "me, we" seemsincredibly prescienttotally important.To this end,the specific project that has made this possible for meis a series of exhibitions,all titled with an F --Freestyle, Frequency and Flow --which have set out to discoverand definethe young, black artists working in this momentwho I feel stronglywill continue to work over the next many years.This series of exhibitionswas made specificallyto try and questionthe idea of what it would meannow, at this point in history,to see art as a catalyst;what it means now, at this point in history,as we define and redefine culture,black culture specifically in my case,but culture generally.I named this group of artistsaround an idea, which I put out therecalled post-black,really meant to define themas artists who came and start their work now,looking back at history but start in this moment, historically.It is really in this sense of discoverythat I have a new set of questions that I'm asking.This new set of questions is:What does it mean, right now,to be African-American in America?What can artwork say about this?Where can a museum existas the place for us allto have this conversation?Really, most exciting about thisis thinking about the energy and the excitementthat young artists can bring.Their works for me are about,not always just simplyabout the aesthetic innovationthat their minds imagine, that their visions createand put out there in the world,but more, perhaps, importantly,through the excitement of the communitythat they create as important voicesthat would allow us right now to understand our situation,as well as in the future.I am continually amazedby the way in whichthe subject of racecan take itself in many placesthat we don't imagine it should be.I am always amazedby the way in which artists are willingto do that in their work.It is why I look to art.It's why I ask questions of art.It is why I make exhibitions.Now, this exhibition, as I said,40 young artists done over the course of eight years,and for me it's about considering the implications.It's considering the implications ofwhat this generation has to say to the rest of us.It's considering what it means for these artiststo be both out in the world as their work travels,but in their communitiesas people who are seeing and thinkingabout the issues that face us.It's also about thinking aboutthe creative spirit and nurturing it,and imagining, particularly in urban America,about the nurturing of the spirit.Now, where, perhaps, does this end up right now?For me, it is about re-imaginingthis cultural discourse in an international context.So the last iteration of this projecthas been called Flow,with the idea now of creatinga real networkof artists around the world;really looking, not so muchfrom Harlem and out, but looking across,and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa.And as many of us think about that continentand think about what if meansto us all in the 21st century,I have begun that lookingthrough artists, through artworks,and imagining what they can tell us about the future,what they tell us about our future,and what they create in their sense ofoffering us this great possibility of watchingthat continent emerge as partof our bigger dialogue.So, what do I discoverwhen I look at artworks?What do I think aboutwhen I think about art?I feel like the privilege I've had as a curatoris not just the discovery of new works,the discovery of exciting works.But, really, it has beenwhat I've discovered about myselfand what I can offerin the space of an exhibition,to talk about beauty, to talk about power,to talk about ourselves,and to talk and speak to each other.That's what makes me get up every dayand want to think aboutthis generation of black artists and artists around the world.Thank you.

One day, Los Angeles Times columnistSteve Lopez was walking alongthe streets of downtown Los Angeleswhen he heard beautiful music.And the source was a man,an African-American man,charming, rugged, homeless,playing a violin that only had two strings.And I'm telling a story that many of you know,because Steve's columns became the basisfor a book, which was turned into a movie,with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers,the Juilliard-trained double bassistwhose promising career was cut shortby a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,and 30 years later he was living homelesson the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movieto understand not only the beautiful bondthat formed between these two men,but how music helped shape that bond,and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun --in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.I met Mr. Ayers in 2008,two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies,and came backstage and introduced himself.He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious wayabout Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clintonand how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series,all because of the treacherous first violin passage workin the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days latersaying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatmentbecause when he was treated it was with shock therapyand Thorazine and handcuffs,and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.But as a result now, he is prone tothese schizophrenic episodes,the worst of which can manifest themselves ashim explodingand then disappearing for days,wandering the streets of Skid Row,exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mindunleashed upon him.And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitationwhen we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,he was lost.And he was talking aboutinvisible demons and smoke,and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.And I was afraid,not for myself, but I was afraidthat I was going to lose him,that he was going to sink into one of his states,and that I would ruin his relationship with the violinif I started talking about scalesand arpeggios and other exciting forms ofdidactic violin pedagogy.(Laughter)So, I just started playing.And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.And as I played,I understood that there was a profound changeoccurring in Nathaniel's eyes.It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,a chemical reaction, for which my playing the musicwas its catalyst.And Nathaniel's manic ragewas transformed into understanding,a quiet curiosity and grace.And in a miracle, he lifted his own violinand he started playing, by ear,certain snippets of violin concertoswhich he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.And we started talking about music, from Bachto Beethoven and Brahms,Bruckner, all the B's,from Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.And I understood that he not onlyhad an encyclopedic knowledge of music,but he related to this music at a personal level.He spoke about it with the kind of passionand understanding that I share with my colleaguesin the Los Angeles Philharmonic.And through playing music and talking about music,this man had transformedfrom the paranoid, disturbed manthat had just come from walking the streetsof downtown Los Angelesto the charming, erudite,brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.Music is medicine. Music changes us.And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.Because music allows him to take his thoughtsand delusions and shape themthrough his imagination and his creativity,into reality.And that is an escapefrom his tormented state.And I understood that this was the very essence of art.This was the very reason why we made music,that we take something that exists within all of usat our very fundamental core,our emotions,and through our artistic lens,through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.And the reality of that expressionreaches all of usand moves us, inspires and unites us.And for Nathaniel,music brought him back into a fold of friends.The redemptive power of music brought him backinto a family of musiciansthat understood him,that recognized his talentsand respected him.And I will always make music with Nathaniel,whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hallor on Skid Row, because he reminds mewhy I became a musician.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks.Robert Gupta.(Applause)Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists.So, please forgive me.(Laughter)(Music)(Applause)

So, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called "Elizabeth."And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying,"She's a fantastic woman, she does everything.How are we going to introduce her?"So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer,and they came to me and said, "Shekhar, what do you think?"And I said, "I think she's dancing."And I could see everybody looked at me,somebody said, "Bollywood."The other said, "How much did we hire him for?"And the third said, "Let's find another director."I thought I had better change.So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth,and I said, "OK, maybe I am too Bollywood.Maybe Elizabeth, this great icon, dancing?What are you talking about?"So I rethought the whole thing,and then we all came to a consensus.And here was the introduction of thisgreat British icon called "Elizabeth."Leicester: May I join you, my lady?Elizabeth: If it please you, sir.(Music)Shekhar Kapur: So she was dancing.So how many people who saw the film did not getthat here was a woman in love,that she was completely innocentand saw great joy in her life, and she was youthful?And how many of you did not get that?That's the power of visual storytelling,that's the power of dance, that's the power of music:the power of not knowing.When I go out to direct a film,every day we prepare too much, we think too much.Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom.You know, simple words lostin the quicksand of experience.So I come up, and I say,"What am I going to do today?" I'm not going to do what I planned to do,and I put myself into absolute panic.It's my one way of getting rid of my mind,getting rid of this mind that says,"Hey, you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing.You're a director, you've done it for years."So I've got to get thereand be in complete panic.It's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script,I go and I panic myself, I get scared.I'm doing it right now; you can watch me. I'm getting nervous,I don't know what to say, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't want to go there.And as I go there, of course, my A.D. says,"You know what you're going to do, sir." I say, "Of course I do."And the studio executives, they would say,"Hey, look at Shekhar. He's so prepared."And inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khanbecause he's chaotic.I'm allowing myself to go into chaosbecause out of chaos, I'm hoping some moments of truth will come.All preparation is preparation.I don't even know if it's honest.I don't even know if it's truthful.The truth of it all comes on the moment, organically,and if you get five great momentsof great, organic stuffin your storytelling, in your film,your film, audiences will get it.So I'm looking for those moments, and I'm standing thereand saying, "I don't know what to say."So, ultimately, everybody's looking at you,200 people at seven in the morningwho got there at quarter to seven, and you arrived at seven,and everybody's saying,"Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?"And you put yourself into a state of panicwhere you don't know, and so you don't know.And so, because you don't know,you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universethat something -- I'm going to try and access the universethe way Einstein -- say a prayer --accessed his equations,the same source. I'm looking for the same sourcebecause creativity comes from absolutely the same sourcethat you meditate somewhere outside yourself,outside the universe.You're looking for something that comes and hits you.Until that hits you, you're not going to do the first shot.So what do you do?So Cate says, "Shekhar, what do you want me to do?"And I say, "Cate, what do you want to do?" (Laughter)"You're a great actor, and I like to give to my actors --why don't you show me what you want to do?"(Laughter)What am I doing? I'm trying to buy time.I'm trying to buy time.So the first thing about storytelling that I learned,and I follow all the time is: Panic.Panic is the great access of creativitybecause that's the only way to get rid of your mind.Get rid of your mind.Get out of it, get it out.And let's go to the universe becausethere's something out there that is moretruthful than your mind,that is more truthful than your universe.[unclear], you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating itbecause that's what I follow constantlyto find the shunyata somewhere, the emptiness.Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity.So that's what I do.When I was a kid -- I was about eight years old.You remember how India was. There was no pollution.In Delhi, we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota.Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace --and we used to sleep out at night.At school I was being just taught about physics,and I was told thatif there is something that exists,then it is measurable.If it is not measurable,it does not exist.And at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky,as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid,and I used to stare at the universe and say,"How far does this universe go?"My father was a doctor.And I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?"And he said, "Son, it goes on forever."So I said, "Please measure foreverbecause in school they're teaching methat if I cannot measure it, it does not exist.It doesn't come into my frame of reference."So, how far does eternity go?What does forever mean?And I would lie there crying at nightbecause my imagination could not touch creativity.So what did I do?At that time, at the tender age of seven,I created a story.What was my story?And I don't know why, but I remember the story.There was a woodcutterwho's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood,and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax.And when that ax hits that piece of wood,that's when everything will destroyand the Big Bang will happen again.But all before that there was a woodcutter.And then when I would run out of that story,I would imagine that woodcutter's universeis one atom in the ax of another woodcutter.So every time, I could tell my story again and againand get over this problem,and so I got over the problem.How did I do it? Tell a story.So what is a story?A story is our -- all of us --we are the stories we tell ourselves.In this universe, and this existence,where we live with this dualityof whether we exist or notand who are we,the stories we tell ourselves are the storiesthat define the potentialitiesof our existence.We are the stories we tell ourselves.So that's as wide as we look at stories.A story is the relationshipthat you develop between who you are,or who you potentially are,and the infinite world, and that's our mythology.We tell our stories,and a person without a story does not exist.So Einstein told a storyand followed his stories and came up with theoriesand came up with theories and then came up with his equations.Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him,and he went out to conquer the world.We all, everybody, has a story that they follow.We tell ourselves stories.So, I will go further, and I say,"I tell a story, and therefore I exist."I exist because there are stories,and if there are no stories, we don't exist.We create stories to define our existence.If we do not create the stories,we probably go mad.I don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time.Now, a film.A film tells a story.I often wonder when I make a film -- I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha --and I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elementsthat are given to a director --if he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera --would we get Buddhism better?But that puts some kind of burden on me.I have to tell a storyin a much more elaborate way,but I have the potential.It's called subtext.When I first went to Hollywood, they said --I used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me,"Would you kindly not talk about subtext?"And I said, "Why?" He said, "Because nobody is going to give you a filmif you talk about subtext.Just talk about plotand say how wonderful you'll shoot the film,what the visuals will be."So when I look at a film,here's what we look for:We look for a story on the plot level,then we look for a storyon the psychological level,then we look for a story on the political level,then we look at a storyon a mythological level.And I look for stories on each level.Now, it is not necessarythat these stories agree with each other.What is wonderful is,at many times, the stories will contradict with each other.So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician,I often tell him, "Don't follow what the script already says.Find that which is not.Find the truth for yourself,and when you find the truth for yourself,there will be a truth in it, but it may contradict the plot,but don't worry about it."So, the sequel to "Elizabeth," "Golden Age."When I made the sequel to "Elizabeth," here was a story thatthe writer was telling:A woman who was threatenedby Philip IIand was going to war,and was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh.Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh,she was giving up the reasons she was a queen,and then Walter Raleighfell in love with her lady in waiting,and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to waror she wanted...Here's the story I was telling:The gods up there,there were two people.There was Philip II, who was divinebecause he was always praying,and there was Elizabeth, who was divine,but not quite divine because she thought she was divine,but the blood of being mortal flowed in her.But the divine one was unjust,so the gods said,"OK, what we need to do ishelp the just one."And so they helped the just one.And what they did was, they sent Walter Raleigh downto physically separate her mortal selffrom her spirit self.And the mortal self was the girlthat Walter Raleigh was sent,and gradually he separated herso she was free to be divine.And the two divine people fought,and the gods were on the side of divinity.Of course, all the British press got really upset.They said, "We won the Armada."But I said, "But the storm won the Armada.The gods sent the storm."So what was I doing?I was trying to find a mythic reasonto make the film.Of course, when I asked Cate Blanchett, I said, "What's the film about?"She said, "The film's about a womancoming to terms with growing older."Psychological.The writer said "It's about history, plot."I said "It's about mythology,the gods."So let me show you a film --a piece from that film --and how a camera also --so this is a scene, where in my mind,she was at the depths of mortality.She was discovering what mortality actually means,and if she is at the depths of mortality,what really happens.And she's recognizing the dangers of mortalityand why she should break away from mortality.Remember, in the film, to me,both her and her lady in waitingwere parts of the same body,one the mortal selfand one the spirit self.So can we have that second?(Music)Elizabeth: Bess?Bess?Bess Throckmorton?Bess: Here, my lady.Elizabeth: Tell me, is it true?Are you with child?Are you with child?Bess: Yes, my lady.Elizabeth: Traitorous.You dare to keep secrets from me?You ask my permission before you rut,before you breed.My bitches wear my collars.Do you hear me? Do you hear me?Walsingham: Majesty. Please, dignity. Mercy.Elizabeth: This is no time for mercy, Walsingham.You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business.Is it his?Tell me. Say it. Is the child his? Is it his?Bess: Yes.My lady,it is my husband's child.Elizabeth: Bitch! (Cries)Raleigh: Majesty.This is not the queen I love and serve.Elizabeth: This man has seduced a ward of the queen,and she has married without royal consent.These offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him.Go.You no longer have the queen's protection.Bess: As you wish, Majesty.Elizabeth: Get out! Get out! Get out!Get out.(Music)Shekhar Kapur: So, what am I trying to do here?Elizabeth has realized,and she's coming face-to-facewith her own sense of jealousy,her own sense of mortality.What am I doing with the architecture?The architecture is telling a story.The architecture is telling a storyabout how, even though she's the most powerful womanin the world at that time,there is the other, the architecture's bigger.The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic.It'll survive her.So it's telling you, to me, stone is part of her destiny.Not only that, why is the camera looking down?The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well.She's in the absolute wellof her own sense of being mortal.That's where she has to pull herself outfrom the depths of mortality,come in, release her spirit.And that's the moment where, in my mind,both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.But that's the momentshe's surgically removing herself from that.So the film is operating onmany many levels in that scene.And how we tell storiesvisually, with music, with actors,and at each level it's a different senseand sometimes contradictory to each other.So how do I start all this?What's the process of telling a story?About ten years ago,I heard this little thing from a politician,not a politician that was very well respected in India.And he said that these people in the cities,in one flush, expend as much wateras you people in the rural areasdon't get for your family for two days.That struck a chord, and I said, "That's true."I went to see a friend of mine,and he made me waitin his apartment in Malabar Hillon the twentieth floor,which is a really, really upmarket area in Mumbai.And he was having a shower for 20 minutes.I got bored and left, and as I drove out,I drove past the slums of Bombay,as you always do,and I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sunof women and children with bucketswaiting for a tankerto come and give them water.And an idea started to develop.So how does that become a story?I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster.So my next film is called "Paani"which means water.And now, out of the mythology of that,I'm starting to create a world.What kind of world do I create,and where does the idea, the design of that come?So, in my mind, in the future,they started to build flyovers.You understand flyovers? Yeah?They started to build flyoversto get from A to B faster,but they effectively went from one area of relative wealthto another area of relative wealth.And then what they did wasthey created a city above the flyovers.And the rich people moved to the upper cityand left the poorer people in the lower cities,about 10 to 12 percent of the peoplehave moved to the upper city.Now, where does this upper city and lower city come?There's a mythology in India about --where they say, and I'll say it in Hindi,[Hindi]Right. What does that mean?It says that the rich are always sitting on the shouldersand survive on the shoulders of the poor.So, from that mythology, the upper city and lower city come.So the design has a story.And now, what happens is that the people of the upper city,they suck up all the water.Remember the word I said, suck up.They suck up all the water, keep to themselves,and they drip feed the lower city.And if there's any revolution, they cut off the water.And, because democracy still exists,there's a democratic way in which you say"Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water."So, okay my time is up.But I can go on about telling youhow we evolve stories,and how stories effectively are who we areand how these get translated into the particular disciplinethat I am in, which is film.But ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction.Everything's a contradiction.The universe is a contradiction.And all of us are constantly looking for harmony.When you get up, the night and day is a contradiction.But you get up at 4 a.m.That first blush of blue is where the night and dayare trying to find harmony with each other.Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you,but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that.All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony.It's the effect of looking for harmonyin the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind,a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind.In a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities.In a poet's mind, it's a conflict of words,in the universe's mind, between day and night.In the mind of a man and a woman,we're looking constantly atthe contradiction between male and female,we're looking for harmony within each other.The whole idea of contradiction,but the acceptance of contradictionis the telling of a story, not the resolution.The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywoodand many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his,that we try to resolve the contradiction.Harmony is not resolution.Harmony is the suggestion of a thingthat is much larger than resolution.Harmony is the suggestion of somethingthat is embracing and universaland of eternity and of the moment.Resolution is something that is far more limited.It is finite; harmony is infinite.So that storytelling, like all other contradictions in the universe,is looking for harmony and infinityin moral resolutions, resolving one, but letting another go,letting another go and creating a question that is really important.Thank you very much.(Applause)

I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.and my goal for the next decadeNow, I have a plan for this,and it entails convincing more people,Some of you might be thinking,Maybe too much time,actually the opposite is true.to solve the world's most urgent problems.the next century on this planet,I've calculated the total we needso I'll say it again, let it sink in:If we want to solve problems like hunger,(Laughter)No. I'm serious. I am.Here's why.(Laughter)Truly.And this is a classic gaming emotion.Now, if you're not a gamer,You probably see the sense of urgency,is a sign of optimism,and the eyebrows up is surprise.(Laughter)Oh, you've heard of that.OK, good, so we have some gamers among us.That's an epic win.And this is the face that we need to seethe face of someone who, against all odds,is on the verge of an epic win.This is actually me making it.Can you see? Yes. Good.We do achieve more in game worlds.inspired to collaborate and to cooperate.And when we're in game worlds,to get up after failure and try again.And in real life, when we face failure,We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed,they just don't exist in games.What about games makes it impossibleto feel that we can't achieve everything?How can we take those feelings from gamesand apply them to real-world work?And I started to notice a few thingsespecially in World of Warcraft,But not just any mission,Right? So you can do it.so you have to try hard.wringing your hands --There are also tons of collaborators.and what we're doing,and we get all this positive feedback.When I get off this stage,+20 crazy idea.I don't get that feedback in real life.It's just better than reality.have spent 5.93 million yearssolving the virtual problems of Azeroth.Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.It might sound like it's a bad thing.But to put that in context:5.93 million years agoThat was the first upright primate.So when we talk about how much timewhich is an extraordinary thing.But it's also apt,This is true. I believe this.by the age of 21.if you have perfect attendance.(Laughter)the "10,000 hours" theory of success.that says if we can master 10,000 hourswe will be virtuosos at it.We will be as good at whatever we doas the greatest people in the world.And so, now what we're looking atSo, the big question is,Because if we could figure that out,These are our virtuoso gamers,And in the next decade,we're going to have another billion gamersThe game industry is developing consolesinstead of broadband Internet,so that gamers all over the world,It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.So I've started to think aboutHere are the four things I came up with.The first is urgent optimism.to tackle an obstacle,Gamers don't sit around.even if they've beaten us badly.that they will play by the same rules,And so, playing a game togetherBlissful productivity. I love it.that we're actually happier working hardthan we are relaxing, or hanging out.to do hard and meaningful work.if they're given the right work.Finally: epic meaning.to human planetary-scale stories.is the World of Warcraft wiki.Five million people use it every month.They are building an epic story.about the World of Warcraft.of changing the world.And the only problem is,and not the real world.His work is brilliant.and money in online worlds.And he says,And he's an economist, so he's rational.And he says --(Laughter)But he says that this makes perfect sense,than they can in real life.than they can have in real life;than they do in real life.So he says, for now it makes perfect sense2,500 years ago.Before we had awesome game controllers,we had sheep's knuckles.designed by human beings,you might know this history,were invented in the kingdom of Lydia,during a time of famine.Apparently, there was such a severe famineand they set up a kingdom-wide policy:On one day, everybody would eat,because games are so engaging,and on the next day, they would eat.And according to Herodotus,they passed 18 years this way,surviving through a famine,we're using games to get awayand we're getting what we need from games.But it doesn't have to end there.This is really exciting.They divided the entire kingdom in half.They played one dice game,They would leave Lydia,leaving behind just enough peopleNow, this sounds crazy, right?who then led to the Roman Empire,So this crazy story might be true.escaping to games for 18 years,and then been so inspired,Okay, we can do that.(Laughter)We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.That was 16 years ago.They played dice games for 18 years,we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.I say we are ready for our own epic game.Let's get half of us to agreeto spend an hour a day playing games,until we solve real-world problems.Now, I know you're asking,at the Institute for the Future.What we want to do is make the future.We want to imagine epic wins,in their own futures.This is World Without Oil.We made this game in 2007.This is an online gameThe oil shortage is fictional,but we put enough online content out therefor you to believe that it's real,So when you come to the game,you sign up, tell us where you live,how transportation is being affected,if schools are closed, if there's rioting,as if this were true.And then we ask you to blog about it,to post videos, to post photos.Nobody wants to change how they live,and tell them, "We've run out of oil.that they learned in this game.So for the next world-saving game,This supercomputer was calledWe asked people to come online --almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.(Laughter)we said, "Everybody's on the dream team,the future of food, the future of health,So, finally, the last game,we're launching it March 3rd.If you complete the game,as a Social Innovator, class of 2010.I would like to invite all of youwho might benefit from coming togetherSo, I'm going to wrap up now.I want to ask a question.What do you think happens next?that we can use to do real-world work,We have all these amazing superpowers:Let the world-changing games begin.Thank you.(Applause)



eric_mead_the_magic_of_the_placebo

For some time I have been interested inthe placebo effect,which might seem like an odd thingfor a magician to be interested in,unless you think of it in the terms that I do,which is, "Something fakeis believed in enough by somebodythat it becomes something real."In other words, sugar pillshave a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies,the placebo effect,just because the person thinksthat what's happening to them is a pharmaceuticalor some sort of a --for pain management, for example,if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the bodycalled the placebo effect.Something fake becomessomething realbecause of someone's perception of it.In order for us to understand each other,I want to start by showing you a rudimentary,very simple magic trick.And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trickthat's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s.I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s.I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.And then I'll explain why I explained it.So, here's what happens.The knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine.I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this.I'll get my sleeve back.And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeveI'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here.That way you can see that at no timecan anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing therenothing can go up or down my sleeve.And the object of this is quite simple.I'm going to open my hand,and hopefully, if all is well,my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife.In fact it's held so tightly in placethat I can shake it,and the knife does not come off.Nothing goes up or down my sleeve,no trickery. And you can examine everything.Ta-da!(Applause)So, this is a trick that I often teach to young childrenthat are interested in magic, because you can learna great deal about deception by studyingthis very -- even though it's a very simple trick methodologically.Probably many of you in the room know this trick.What happens is this.I hold the knife in my hand.I say I'm going to grab hold of my wristto make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve,that is a lie.The reason I'm holding onto my wristis because that's actually the secretof the illusion.In a moment when my hand moves from facing youto being away from you,this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shiftfrom where it is, to a positionpointing out like this.Nice one.Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there.(Laughter)So, it goes like this, from here, right.And as I move around my finger shifts.And we could talk about why this is deceptive,why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here,because the mind, and the way it processes information,it doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them.But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up.Obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism,but by chicanery,my index finger being there.And then when I close my finger, same thing,as I move back, this motionkind of covers the moving back of my finger.I take this hand away. You give the knife out.There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks.Now, (Laughter)what does that have to do with the placebo effect?I read a study a year or so agothat really blew my mind wide open.I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me,was an astonishing thing.It turns out that if you administera placebo in the form of a white pill,that's like aspirin shaped --it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect.But if you change the form that you give the placebo in,like you make a smaller pill,and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it,it is actually measurably more effective.Even though neither one of these thingshas any pharmaceutical -- they're sugar pills.But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.What? (Laughter) That really flipped me out.Turns out though, that that's not even where it stops.If you have capsules,they're more effective than tablets in any form.A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the otheris better than a white capsule.Dosage has something to do with this.One pill twice a dayis not as good at three pills --I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry.But the point is ...(Laughter) ... these dosages have something to do with it.And the form has something to do with it.And if you want the ultimate in placebo,you've go to the needle.Right? A syringe with some inert --a couple CCs of some inert something,and you inject this into a patient ...Well this is such a powerful image in their mind,it's so much stronger than the white pill.It's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to yousome other time when we have slides.The point isthe white pill is not as good as the blue pillis not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle.And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality,it's only your belief that makes it realin your body and makes a stronger effect.I wanted to see if I could take that ideaand apply it to a magic trick.And take something that is obviously a fake trickand make it seem real.And we know from that studythat when you want reality, you go to the needle.This is a seven-inch hatpin. It's very, very sharp,and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit.This is really my flesh. This is notDamian's special-grown flesh.That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect.I'm going to pierce my skinand run this needle through to the other side.If you're queasy -- (Laughs)if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friendsin the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know,and one woman almost passed out.So, I suggest if you get queasy easythat you look away for about the next 30 --in fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it.You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.So, here is what happens, right here,the beginning of my fleshat the lower part of my arm I just makea little pierce.I'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out?OK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit,and then out the other side like this.Now, essentially we're in the same position we were inwith the knife trick.(Laughter)Sort of.But you can't count my fingers right now can you?So, let me show them to you. That's one, twothree, four, five.Yes, well...I know what people think when they see this.They go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enoughto stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes.So, let me give you a little peek.How's that look out there? Pretty good.(Laughs)Yeah, I know. (Laughs)And the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that."People in the satellite room are starting to move in now.Let me give you good close look at this.That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect.That's my flesh, and I can twist that around.I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away,don't look at the thing.People in the back or people on video years from now watching thiswill go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neatin some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be --see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding.Well let me work up some blood for you.(Laughter)Yes, there it is.(Applause)(Laughter)Normally now, I would take the needle out.I would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds.But I think in this contextand with the idea of taking something fakeand making it into something real,I'm just going to leave it there,and walk off the stage.(Laughter)I will be seeing you several times over the next few days.I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.(Laughter)(Applause)

(Music)(Applause)I'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer,I'm not a choreographer -- I'm actually a filmmaker, a storyteller.I directed a movie two years agocalled "Step Up 2: The Streets."Anybody? Anybody? Yeah!During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers --amazing, the best in the world --and they brought me into a society, the sort of undergroundstreet culture that blew my mind.I mean, this is literally human beingswith super-human strength and abilities.They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back.They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row.I'd never seen anything like that.When I was growing up, my heroes were people likeFred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.I grew up in a musical family.(Laughter)And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes.Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valleywith low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger.Those guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do thatmoonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl."(Applause)And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared,sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos.But after seeing what I've seen,the truth is, they have not disappeared at all.They're here, getting better and better every day.And dance has progressed.It is insane what dance is right now.Dance has never had a better friend than technology.Online videos and social networking ...dancers have created a whole global laboratory onlinefor dance, where kids in Japan are taking movesfrom a YouTube video created in Detroit,building on it within days and releasing a new video,while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing itwith a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself.And this is happening every day.And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages,with cheap webcams,lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.Our Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellysour Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips,and may not have that opportunity, except for us.So, we created the LXD,sort of a -- the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers,a justice league of dancers that believethat dance can have a transformative effect on the world.A living, breathing comic book series,but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man,these guys can actually do it.And we're going to show you some today. So, let me introduce to you,some of our heroes right now.We got Madd Chadd,Lil' C, Kid David and J Smooth.Please be excited, have fun, yell, scream.Ladies and gentlemen: The LXD.(Applause)(Video): Madd Chadd: When people first see me,I get a lot of different reactions actually.Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it,but sometimes they get a little freaked out.And, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit.(Music)(Applause)J Smooth: When I'm in the zone -- I'm dancing and free styling it --I actually visually kind of picturelines, and moving them.I think of like, Transformers,like how panels open and then they fold,they fold in, and then you close that panel.And then another thing opens,you close that.(Music)(Applause)Kid David: It's kind of like, honestly a lot of timesI don't really know what's going onwhen I'm dancing.Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.It's not really a conscious decision,"I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this."It's kind of like this other levelwhere you can't make choices anymore,and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music.I got my name just because I was so young.I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with.So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid.(Music)(Applause)L'il C: I tell them to create a ball,and then you just use that ball of energy.And instead of throwing it out, people would thinkthat's a krump move, that's a krump move.That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out,you throw it out, and you hold it.And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail,you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.And you just got this piece of energyand you just, you're manipulating it.You know, you create power, then you tame it.(Music)(Applause)(Music)(Applause)

I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.In high school, I took a bus to schoolan hour each way every day.And I was always absorbed in a book,science fiction book,which took my mind to other worlds,and satisfied, in a narrative form,this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.And you know, that curiosity also manifested itselfin the fact that whenever I wasn't in schoolI was out in the woods,hiking and taking "samples" --frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water --and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope.You know, I was a real science geek.But it was all about trying to understand the world,understand the limits of possibility.And my love of science fictionactually seemed mirrored in the world around me,because what was happening, this was in the late '60s,we were going to the moon,we were exploring the deep oceans.Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living roomswith his amazing specials that showed usanimals and places and a wondrous worldthat we could never really have previously imagined.So, that seemed to resonatewith the whole science fiction part of it.And I was an artist.I could draw. I could paint.And I found that because there weren't video gamesand this saturation of CG movies and all of thisimagery in the media landscape,I had to create these images in my head.You know, we all did, as kids having toread a book, and through the author's description,put something on the movie screen in our heads.And so, my response to this was to paint, to drawalien creatures, alien worlds,robots, spaceships, all that stuff.I was endlessly getting busted in math classdoodling behind the textbook.That was -- the creativityhad to find its outlet somehow.And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau showsactually got me very excited about the fact that there wasan alien world right here on Earth.I might not really go to an alien worldon a spaceship someday --that seemed pretty darn unlikely.But that was a world I could really go to,right here on Earth, that was as rich and exoticas anything that I had imaginedfrom reading these books.So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diverat the age of 15.And the only problem with that was that I livedin a little village in Canada,600 miles from the nearest ocean.But I didn't let that daunt me.I pestered my father until he finally founda scuba class in Buffalo, New York,right across the border from where we live.And I actually got certifiedin a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winterin Buffalo, New York.And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,for another two years,until we moved to California.Since then, in the intervening40 years,I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,and 500 hours of that was in submersibles.And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,and even the shallow oceans,are so rich with amazing lifethat really is beyond our imagination.Nature's imagination is so boundlesscompared to our ownmeager human imagination.I still, to this day, stand in absolute aweof what I see when I make these dives.And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,and just as strong as it ever was.But when I chose a career as an adult,it was filmmaking.And that seemed to be the best way to reconcilethis urge I had to tell storieswith my urges to create images.And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and storiestogether, and that made sense.And of course the stories that I chose to tellwere science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens"and "The Abyss."And with "The Abyss," I was putting together my loveof underwater and diving with filmmaking.So, you know, merging the two passions.Something interesting came out of "The Abyss,"which was that to solve a specific narrativeproblem on that film,which was to create this kind of liquid water creature,we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.And this resulted in the first soft-surfacecharacter, CG animationthat was ever in a movie.And even though the film didn't make any money --barely broke even, I should say --I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,the global audience, was mesmerizedby this apparent magic.You know, it's Arthur Clarke's lawthat any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.They were seeing something magical.And so that got me very excited.And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embracedinto the cinematic art."So, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film,we took that much farther.Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dudein that film. The success hung in the balanceon whether that effect would work.And it did, and we created magic again,and we had the same result with an audience --although we did make a little more money on that one.So, drawing a line through those two dotsof experiencecame to, "This is going to be a whole new world,"this was a whole new world of creativityfor film artists.So, I started a company with Stan Winston,my good friend Stan Winston,who is the premier make-up and creature designerat that time, and it was called Digital Domain.And the concept of the company wasthat we would leapfrog pastthe analog processes of optical printers and so on,and we would go right to digital production.And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90sin the creature and character design stuffthat we had actually founded the company to do.So, I wrote this piece called "Avatar,"which was meant to absolutely push the envelopeof visual effects,of CG effects, beyond,with realistic human emotive charactersgenerated in CG,and the main characters would all be in CG,and the world would be in CG.And the envelope pushed back,and I was told by the folks at my companythat we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.(Laughter)You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:"It's going to be this epic romance,passionate film."Secretly, what I wanted to do wasI wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic."And that's why I made the movie.(Applause)And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.But I convinced them. I said,"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.We'll be using it in the opening of the film.It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook."And I talked them into funding an expedition.(Laughter)Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that themeabout your imagination creating a reality.Because we actually created a reality where six months later,I find myself in a Russian submersibletwo and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,looking at the real Titanic through a view port.Not a movie, not HD -- for real.(Applause)Now, that blew my mind.And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build camerasand lights and all kinds of things.But, it struck me how muchthis dive, these deep dives,was like a space mission.You know, where it was highly technical,and it required enormous planning.You get in this capsule, you go down to this darkhostile environmentwhere there is no hope of rescueif you can't get back by yourself.And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like,living in a science fiction movie.This is really cool."And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it --it was everything. It was adventure,it was curiosity, it was imagination.And it was an experience thatHollywood couldn't give me.Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we couldcreate a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeingout that window.As we did some of our subsequent expeditions,I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal ventsand sometimes things that I had never seen before,sometimes things that no one had seen before,that actually were not described by scienceat the time that we saw them and imaged them.So, I was completely smitten by this,and had to do more.And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.After the success of "Titanic,"I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day jobas a Hollywood movie maker,and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while."And so, we started planning theseexpeditions.And we wound up going to the Bismark,and exploring it with robotic vehicles.We went back to the Titanic wreck.We took little bots that we had createdthat spooled a fiber optic.And the idea was to go in and do an interiorsurvey of that ship, which had never been done.Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,so we created technology to do it.So, you know, here I am now, on the deckof Titanic, sitting in a submersible,and looking out at planks that look much like this,where I knew that the band had played.And I'm flying a little robotic vehiclethrough the corridor of the ship.When I say, "I'm operating it,"but my mind is in the vehicle.I felt like I was physically presentinside the shipwreck of Titanic.And it was the most surreal kindof deja vu experience I've ever had,because I would know before I turned a cornerwhat was going to be there before the lightsof the vehicle actually revealed it,because I had walked the set for monthswhen we were making the movie.And the set was based as an exact replicaon the blueprints of the ship.So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.And it really made me realize thatthe telepresence experience --that you actually can have these robotic avatars,then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,into this other form of existence.It was really, really quite profound.And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happeningsome decades outas we start to have cyborg bodiesfor exploration or for other meansin many sort ofpost-human futuresthat I can imagine,as a science fiction fan.So, having done these expeditions,and really beginning to appreciate what was down there,such as at the deep ocean ventswhere we had these amazing, amazing animals --they're basically aliens right here on Earth.They live in an environment of chemosynthesis.They don't survive on sunlight-basedsystem the way we do.And so, you're seeing animals that are living next toa 500-degree-Centigradewater plumes.You think they can't possibly exist.At the same timeI was getting very interested in space science as well --again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.And I wound up getting involved withthe space community,really involved with NASA,sitting on the NASA advisory board,planning actual space missions,going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonautbiomedical protocols,and all these sorts of things,to actually go and fly to the international space stationwith our 3D camera systems.And this was fascinating.But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientistswith us into the deep.And taking them down so that they had access --astrobiologists, planetary scientists,people who were interested in these extreme environments --taking them down to the vents, and letting them see,and take samples and test instruments, and so on.So, here we were making documentary films,but actually doing science,and actually doing space science.I'd completely closed the loopbetween being the science fiction fan,you know, as a kid,and doing this stuff for real.And you know, along the way in this journeyof discovery,I learned a lot.I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lotabout leadership.Now you think director has got to be a leader,leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.I didn't really learn about leadershipuntil I did these expeditions.Because I had to, at a certain point, say,"What am I doing out here?Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?"We don't make money at these damn shows.We barely break even. There is no fame in it.People sort of think I went awaybetween "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nailssomeplace, sitting at the beach.Made all these films, made all these documentary filmsfor a very limited audience.No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing?You're doing it for the task itself,for the challenge --and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is --for the thrill of discovery,and for that strange bond that happenswhen a small group of people form a tightly knit team.Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people,working for years at a time,sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.And in that bond, you realizethat the most important thingis the respect that you have for themand that they have for you, that you've done a taskthat you can't explain to someone else.When you come back to the shore and you say,"We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,and the this and the that,all the technology of it, and the difficulty,the human-performance aspects of working at sea,"you can't explain it to people. It's that thing thatmaybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something togetherand they know they can never explain it.Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect.So, when I came back to make my next movie,which was "Avatar,"I tried to apply that same principle of leadership,which is that you respect your team,and you earn their respect in return.And it really changed the dynamic.So, here I was again with a small team,in uncharted territory,doing "Avatar," coming up with new technologythat didn't exist before.Tremendously exciting.Tremendously challenging.And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period.And it completely changed how I do movies.So, people have commented on how, "Well, you know,you brought back the ocean organismsand put them on the planet of Pandora."To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business,the process itself, that changed as a result of that.So, what can we synthesize out of all this?You know, what are the lessons learned?Well, I think number one iscuriosity.It's the most powerful thing you own.Imagination is a forcethat can actually manifest a reality.And the respect of your teamis more important than all thelaurels in the world.I have young filmmakerscome up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this."And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself.Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself,don't bet against yourself,and take risks."NASA has this phrase that they like:"Failure is not an option."But failure has to be an optionin art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.And no important endeavorthat required innovationwas done without risk.You have to be willing to take those risks.So, that's the thought I would leave you with,is that in whatever you're doing,failure is an option,but fear is not. Thank you.(Applause)

So, what I'm going to do isjust give you the latest episode of India's --maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera,which is cricket.And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:It's got love, joy, happiness,sadness, tears, laughter,lots of deceit, intrigue.And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 yearswhen the audience interest changes.And that's exactly what cricket has done.It's jumped 20 yearsinto 20-over game.And that's what I'm going to talk about,how a small changeleads to a very big revolution.But it wasn't always like that.Cricket wasn't always thisspeed-driven generations game.There was a time when you played cricket,you played timeless test matches,when you played on till the game got over.And there was this game in March 1939that started on the third of Marchand ended on the 14th of March.And it only ended because the English cricketershad to go from Durban to Cape Town,which is a two-hour train journey,to catch the ship that left on the 17th,because the next ship wasn't around for a long time.So, the match was ended in between.And one of the English batsmen said, "You know what?Another half an hour and we would have won."(Laughter)Another half an hour after 12 days.There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained,so they all sat around making friends with each other.But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket:because we had about the same pace of life.(Laughter)The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it?You fought by day, then it was sunset,so everyone went back home.And then you worked out your strategy,and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket wasthat in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.Princes patronize the game,not because they love the game,but because it was a means of ingratiating themselvesto the British rulers.But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket,which was, all you needed was a plank of woodand a rubber ball, and any number of peoplecould play it anywhere.Take a look:You could play it in the dumpwith some rocks over there,you could play it in a little alley --you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.(Laughter)You could play it on the banks of the Ganges --that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.Or you could play many games in one small patch of land,even if you didn't know which game you were actually in.(Laughter)As you can see, you can play anywhere.But slowly the game moved on,you know, finally.You don't always have five days. So, we moved on,and we started playing 50-over cricket.And then an enormous accident took place.In Indian sport we don't make things happen,accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.And we won this World Cup in 1983.And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,and we played it virtually every day.There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.But there was another big date.1983 was when we won the World Cup.1991,'92, we found a finance ministerand a prime ministerwilling to let the world look at India,rather than be this great country of intrigueand mystery in this closed country.And so we allowed multinationals into India.We cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,and we got all the multinationals coming in,with multinational budgets,who looked at per-capita incomeand got very excited about the possibilities in India,and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real, one scripted.The scripted one is what you see in the movies,the real one was cricket.And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me,Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take itall over the world.And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.And so cricket started becoming big;cricket started bringing riches in.Television started covering cricket. For a long timetelevision said, "We won't cover cricketunless you pay us to cover it."Then they said, "OK,the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars."So, it's a bit of a curve, that.And then another big accident happened in our cricket.England invented 20 overs cricket,and said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket."Just as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.Thank God for them.(Laughter)And so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see.India didn't want to play the T20 World Cup.But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin.And then something very dramatic happened.We got to the final, and then this moment,that will remain enshrined forever,for everybody, take a look.(Crowd cheering)The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.Announcer: And Zishan takes it! India wins!What a match for a Twenty20 final.India, the world champions.(Cheering)India, T20 champions.But what a game we had, M. S. Dhonigot it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player.A massive, massive success:India, the world TT champions.Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.The accident, of course, there, was that the batsmanthought the bowler was bowling fast.(Laughter)If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go,but it didn't go. And we suddenly discoveredthat we could be good at this game.And what it also did wasit led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.It was at a time when investment was coming in,India was feeling a little more confident about itself.And so there was a feeling that there was great pridein what we can do.And thankfully for all of us,the English are very good at inventing things,and then the gracious people that they are,they let the world become very good at it.(Laughter)And so England invented T20 cricket,and allowed India to hijack it.It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine,we just took it straight away, as is.(Laughter)And so, we launched our own T20 league.Six weeks, city versus city.It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country --the only two areas in which India was very proud abouttheir country, representing itself on the field.One was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.The other was Indian cricket.Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues.But the people getting into these city leagueswere people who were taking their cues from the West.America is a home of leagues. And they said,"Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India."But was India ready for it?Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.It was never promoted, it was never sold -- it was organized.And look what they did with our beautiful, nice,simple family game.All of a sudden, you had that happening.(Music)An opening ceremony to match every other.This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per monththan New Zealand's population twice over.So, it was a different India.But it was also a slightly more orthodox Indiathat was very happy to be modern,but didn't want to say that to people.And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.(Music)(Laughter)The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.They were not bureaucrats who were forcedinto sport because they didn't actually love it;these were people who ran serious companies.And so they started promoting cricket big time,started promoting clubs big time.And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollarsbefore a ball was bowled,1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years,and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchisesthat were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.But what they were very good at doingwas making it very localized.So, just to give you an example of how they did it --not Manchester United style promotion,but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.(Music)Of course, a lot of people said, "Maybe they dance better than they play."(Laughter)But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.All along, if you wanted a young cricketer,you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality,your own city, and you were very proudof the system that produced those cricketers.Now, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot --if Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example,they needn't go to Kalbadevior Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them,they could go to Trinidad.This was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world,where you can source from anywhereas long as you get the best product at the best price.And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the realitythat you can source the best product for the best priceanywhere in the world.So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago,overnight. And when he had to go back to representthe West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?"He said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today."We said, "No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave;it's about when do you have to reach there?"And so he said, "I've got to reach on date X."And they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one."So, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game,went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport,sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal,second refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.(Laughter)Never would India have thought on this scale before.Never would India have said, "I want a player to playone game for me, and I will use a corporate jetto send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaicato play a game."And I just thought to myself,"Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big."But what this also did was it startedmarrying the two most important things in Indian cricket,which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.There is cricket and the movies.And they came together because people in the moviesnow started owning clubs.And so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.And something very interesting happened.We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team --as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well,you got a hug from Preity Zinta.So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look --everyone's watching Preity Zinta.(Music)And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.We'd all seen matches in Kolkata,but we'd never seen anything like this:Shah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked upfor Kolkata -- not for India, but for Kolkata.But take a look at this.(Music)An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketerbecause they'd won in Kolkata.Can you imagine?And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said?(Applause)"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team."(Laughter)But I thought I'd take this opportunity --there's a few people from Pakistan in here.I'm so happy that you're herebecause I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right?We can play cricket together, we can be friends.So thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.(Applause)There was criticism too because they said,"Players are being bought and sold?Are they grain?Are they cattle?"Because we had this auction, you see.How do you fix a price for a player?And so the auction that followedliterally had people saying,"Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player."There it is.(Music)Auctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai.Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars.HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day --so 250 rupees for a test match,but if you finish in four days you only got 200.The best Indian players who played every test match --every one of the internationals, the top of the line players --standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year.Now they were getting 500,000 for six days' work.Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England,he got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said,"For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard,and I'm earning more than the footballers, wow."And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India.Could you have imagined that day would come?One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work.That's not bad, is it?So, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled.What India was doing, though, was benchmarkingitself against the best in the world,and it became a huge brand.Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.IPL became the biggest brand in Indiaand, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa,and we had to start the tournament in three weeks.Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks.But we did it. You know why?Because no country works as slowly as we dotill three weeks before an event,and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks.(Applause)Our population, which for a long time we thought was a problem,suddenly became our biggest assetbecause there were more people watching --the huge consuming class --everybody came to watch the cricket.We'd also made cricket the only sport in India,which is a pity, but in India every other sportpushes cricket to become big,which is a bit of a tragedy of our times.Now, this last minute before I go --there's a couple of side effects of all this.For a long time, India was this country of poverty,dust, beggars,snake charmers, filth,Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.Cricketers all over the world said,"You know, we love India. We love to play in India."And that felt good, you know?We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on viewand there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.Right so, finally,an English game that India usurped a little bit,but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.If you want to take the game around the world,it's got to be the shortest form of the game.You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end,or you can't take it all over the world.So that's what T20 is doing.Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game biggerand hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.Thank you very much. Thank you.(Applause)

I think it was in my second grade that I was caughtdrawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo.I was sent straight away to my school principal,and my school principal, a sweet nun,looked at my book with disgust,flipped through the pages, saw all the nudes --you know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her --and the nun slapped me on my face and said,"Sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun."I had no clue what she was talking about,but it was convincing enough for me never to draw againuntil the ninth grade.Thanks to a really boring lecture,I started caricaturing my teachers in school.And, you know, I got a lot of popularity.I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports.I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home.I'm not on top of the class.So for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity.I got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again.So what I did was I quickly put togethera collage of all the teachers I had drawn,glorified my school principal, put him right on top,and gifted it to him.He had a good laugh at the other teachersand put it up on the notice board.(Laughter)This is a part of that.And I became a school hero.All my seniors knew me. I felt really special.I have to tell you a little bit about my family.That's my mother. I love her to bits.She's the one who taught me how to draw and, more importantly, how to love.She's a bit of a hippie.She said, "Don't say that," but I'm saying it anyway.The rest of my family are boring academics,busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car.My father's a little different.My father believed in a holistic approach to living,and, you know, every time he taught us,he'd say, "I hate these books,because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution."While he still held that worldview, I was 16,I got the best lawyer in town,my older brother Karthik,and I sat him down, and I said, "Pa,from today onwards I've decidedI'm going to be disciplined,I'm going to be curious,I'm going to learn something new every day,I'm going to be very hard working,and I'm not going to depend on youemotionally or financially."And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me.And I said, "Hold that thought."I said, "Can I quit school then?"But, to cut a long story short,I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist.I must have done about 30,000 caricatures.I would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces,anything for anyone who wanted to use my services.But, most importantly, while I was traveling,I taught children cartooning,and in exchange, I learned how to be spontaneous.And mad and crazy and fun.When I started teaching them, I said let me start doing this professionally.When I was 18 I started my own school.However, an 18 year-old trying to start a schoolis not easy unless you have a big patronor a big supporter.So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of Indiawhen I saw that the Prime Minister of Indiawas visiting my home town, Bangalore.And, you know, just like howevery cartoonist knows Bush here,and if you had to meet Bush,it would be the funnest thing becausehis face was a cartoonist's delight.I had to meet my Prime Minister.I went to the place wherehis helicopter was about to land.I saw layers of security.I caricatured my way through three layersby just impressing the guards,but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third.And what happened was, to my luck,I saw a nuclear scientistat whose party I had done cartoons.I ran up to him, and said, "Hello, sir. How do you do?"He said, "What are you doing here, Raghava?"I said, "I'm here to meet the Prime Minister."He said, "Oh, so am I."I hopped into his car, and off we wentthrough the remaining layers of security.(Applause)Thank you.I sat him down, I caricatured him,and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities.This is one I remember fondly.Salman Rushdie was pissed-off I thinkbecause I altered the map of New York, if you notice.(Laughter)Anyway, the next slide I'm about to show you --(Laughter)Should I just turn that off?The next slide I'm about to show you,is a little more serious.I was hesitant to include this in my presentationbecause this cartoon was publishedsoon after 9/11.What was, for me, a very naive observation,turned out to be a disaster.That evening, I came home to hundreds of hate mails,hundreds of people telling me how theycould have lived another day without seeing this.I was also asked to leave the organization,a cartoonists' organization in America,that for me was my lifeline.That's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful,art comes with responsibility.Anyway, what I did was I decidedthat I need to take a break.I quit my job at the papers, I closed my school,and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks,and I decided to go traveling.When I went traveling, I remember,I met this fabulous old man,who I met when I was caricaturing,who turned out to be an artist, in Italy.He invited me to his studio. He said, "Come and visit."When I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever.I saw this dead, naked effigy of himselfhanging from the ceiling.I said, "Oh, my God. What is that?"And I asked him, and he said,"Oh, that thing? In the night, I die.In the morning, I am born again."I thought he was koo koo,but something about that really stuck.I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that.So I said, "I am dead, so I need to be born again."So, I wanted to be a painter like him,except, I don't know how to paint.So, I tried going to the art store.You know, there are a hundred types of brushes.Forget it, they will confuse youeven if you know how to draw.So I decided, I'm going to learn to paint by myself.I'm going to show you a very quick clipto show you how I painted and a little bitabout my city, Bangalore.(Music)They had to be larger than life.Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger.And even bigger.And for me it was, I had to dance while I painted.It was so exciting.Except, I even started painting dancers.Here for example is a Flamenco dancer,except there was one problem.I didn't know the dance form, so I started following them,and I made some money,sold my paintings and would rush offto France or Spain and work with them.That's Pepe Linares, the renowned Flamenco singer.But I had one problem, my paintings never danced.As much energy as I put into themwhile making them, they never danced.So I decided -- I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning.I called my friends, painted on their bodies,and had them dance in front of a painting.And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive.And then I was fortunate enoughto actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus.And I sat like you guys there in the audience.And I saw my work come alive.You know, normally you work in isolation,and you show at a gallery,but here, the work was coming alive,and it had some other artists working with me.The collaborative effort was fabulous.I said, I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet.I started doing fashion.This is a fashion show we held in London.The best collaboration, of course, is with children.They are ruthless, they are honest,but they're full of energy and fun.This is a work, a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation.And I must say, I spent time in the Bronxworking with these kids.And, in exchange for me working with them,they taught me how to be cool.I don't think I've succeeded, but they've taught me.They said, "Stop saying sorry. Say, my bad."(Laughter)Then I said, all this is good,but I want to paint like a real painter.American education is so expensive.I was in India, and I was walking down the streets,and I saw a billboard painter.And these guys paint humongous paintings,and they look really good.And I wondered how they did it from so close.So, one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys,and I said, "How do you paint like that? Who taught you?"And he said, "Oh, it's very easy. I can teach you,but we're leaving the city,because billboard painters are a dying,extinct bunch of artists,because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them."I said, in exchange for education in how to paint,I will support them, and I started a company.And since then, I've been painting all over the place.This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment.This is another painting.And, in fact, I started painting on anything,and started sending them around town.Since I mentioned my wife, the most important collaborationhas been with her, Netra.Netra and I met when she was 18.I must have been 19 and a half then,and it was love at first sight.I lived in India. She lived in America.She'd come every two months to visit me,and then I said I'm the man,I'm the man, and I have to reciprocate.I have to travel seven oceans, and I have to come and see you.I did that twice, and I went broke.So then I said, "Nets, what do I do?"She said, "Why don't you send me your paintings?My dad knows a bunch of rich guys.We'll try and con them into buying it,and then..."But it turned out, after I sent the works to her,that her dad's friends,like most of you, are geeks.I'm joking.(Laughter)No, they were really big geeks,and they didn't know much about art.So Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine.So what we did was we rented a little vanand we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it.She contacted anyone and everyonewho was willing to buy my work.She made enough money, she sold off the whole collectionand made enough money to move me for four yearswith lawyers, a company, everything,and she became my manager.That's us in New York.Notice one thing,we're equal here.Something happened along the line.(Laughter)But this brought me -- with Netra managing my career --it brought me a lot of success.I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar.I loved the attention.This is all the press we got, and we said,it's time to celebrate.And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra.I said, "Let's get married."And I said, "Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us,all the people who bought our work."And you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people,who had made a difference -- a ridiculous list,but I was determined to bring them to India, so --a lot of them were in India.150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding.We had fashion designers, installation artists,models, we had makeup artists, jewelry designers,all kinds of people working with meto make my wedding an art installation.And I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws.I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me.But all this excitement ledto the press writing about us.We were in the papers, we're still in the news three years later,but, unfortunately, something tragic happened right after.My mother fell very ill.I love my motherand I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die.And they said you have to say bye to her,you have to do what you have to do.And I was devastated.I had shows booked up for another year.I was on a high.And I couldn't. I could not.My life was not exuberant.I could not live this larger than life person.I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind.Of course, my work turned ugly,but another thing happened.I lost all my audiences.The Bollywood stars who I would party withand buy my work disappeared.The collectors, the friends, the press,everyone said, "Nice, but thank you.""No thank you," was more like it.But I wanted people to actuallyfeel my work from their gut,because I was painting it from my gut.If they wanted beauty,I said, this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized.Of course, none of them liked it.My works also turned autobiographical.At this point, something else happened.A very, very dear friend of minecame out of the closet,and in India at that time, it was illegal to be gay,and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person.I was very upset.I remember the time when my mother used to dress me upas a little girl -- that's me there --because she wanted a girl, and she has only boys.(Laughter)Anyway, I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk.It's a secret.So, after this, my works turned a little violent.I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform.And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality.This time, not only did my collectors disappear,the political activists decided to ban meand to threaten meand to forbid me from showing.It turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken.I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat.So, I decided it was timeto end and go back home.This time I said let's try something different.I need to be reborn again.And I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children,the best way to have a new lease on life,is to have a child.I decided to have a child,and before I did that, I quickly studied what can go wrong.How can a family get dysfunctional?And Rudra was born.That's my little son.And two magical things happened after he was born.My mother miraculously recoveredafter a serious operation,and this man was elected president of this country.You know I sat at home and I watched.I teared up and I said that's where I want to be.So Netra and I wound up our life,closed up everything we had,and we decided to move to New York.And this was just eight months ago.I moved back to New York, my work has changed.Everything about my work has become more whimsical.This one is called "What the Fuck Was I Thinking?"It talks about mental incest.You know, I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy.But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything.But I'm very civil in my action, I assure you.(Laughter)These are just different cartoons.And, before I go, I want to tell you a little story.I was talking to mother and father this morning,and my dad said, "I know you have so much you want to say,but you have to talk about your work with children."So I said, okay.I work with children all over the world,and that's an entirely different talk,but I want to leave you with one storythat really, really inspired me.I met Belinda when she was 16.I was 17.I was in Australia,and Belinda had cancer,and I was told she's not going to live very long.They, in fact, told me three weeks.I walk into her room, and there was a shy girl,and she was bald, and she was trying to hide her baldness.I whipped out my pen, and I started drawing on her headand I drew a crown for her.And then, we started talking, and we spent a lovely time --I told her how I ended up in Australia,how I backpacked and who I conned, and how I got a ticket,and all the stories.And I drew it out for her.And then I left.Belinda diedand within a few days of her death,they published a book for her,and she used my cartoon on the cover.And she wrote a little note, she said,"Hey Rags, thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world."For me, my art is my magic carpet ride.I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride,and touch children and be honest.Thank you so much.(Applause)

That creates the front page.But this isn't about Reddit.One of the ways they wanted to do it(Laughter)And this was a special name.In fact, someone on Reddit thought,And Redditors responded and all agreed.So the voting started.to 70 percent at the end of voting.(Laughter)really got behind this.Facebook groups were created.Facebook applications were created.(Laughter)Which is obvious. It's a great name.(Laughter)I think that's what helped drive this.What was cool were the repercussions.Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins,the whales were happy -- that's a quote.(Laughter)is that it's OK to lose control,you could ultimately achieve your goal.Thank you.(Applause)

Hello, everyone. Because this is my first time at TED,I've decided to bring along an old friendto help break the ice a bit.Yes. That's right. This is Barbie.She's 50 years old. And she's looking as young as ever.(Laughter)But I'd also like to introduce you towhat may be an unfamiliar face.This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations,Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.They have different interests. They have divergent values.And should they ever come in contact ...well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty.My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.Where I work, in the Arab region,people are busy taking up Western innovationsand changing them into thingswhich are neither conventionally Western,nor are they traditionally Islamic.I want to show you two examples.The first is 4Shbab.It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel.(Video): Video clips from across the globe.The USA.♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫♫ I am not afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side ♫♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫♫ Everything will be all right ♫♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫The Arab world.(Music)♫ She was preserved by modesty of the religion ♫♫ She was adorned by the light of the Quran ♫Shereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV.Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producercalled Ahmed Abu Haïba,wants young people to be inspiredby Islam to lead better lives.He reckons the best way to get that message acrossis to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.4Shbab was set up as an alternativeto existing Arab music channels.And they look something like this.(Music)That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop starand pan-Arab pin-up girl.In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.But it's not about fire and brimstone either.Its videos are intended to showa kinder, gentler face of Islam,for young people to deal with life's challenges.Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.And it's called "The 99."Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologistcalled Naif Al Mutawa.And his desire is to rescue Islamfrom images of intolerance,all in a child-friendly format."The 99." The characters are meant to embodythe 99 attributes of Allah:justice, wisdom, mercy, among others.So, for example, there is the character of Noora.She is meant to have the powerto look inside peopleand see the good and bad in everyone.Another character called Jamihas the ability to create fantastic inventions.Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book.It's now a theme park.There is an animated series in the works.And by this time next year,the likes of Superman and Wonder Womanwill have joined forces with "The 99"to beat injustice wherever they find it."The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examplesof this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations.Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations,in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined.Now, while 4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny,there is actually a very long tradition of this.Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizationsboth ancient and modern.After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this:"We made you into nations and tribesso that you could learn from one another."And to my mind, those are pretty wise words,no matter what your creed. Thank you.(Applause)

As an Indian, and now as a politicianand a government minister,I've become rather concerned aboutthe hype we're hearing about our own country,all this talk about India becoming a world leader,even the next superpower.In fact, the American publishers of my book,"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,"added a gratuitous subtitle saying,"India: The next 21st-century power."And I just don't think that's what India's all about,or should be all about.Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadershipseems to me terribly archaic.It's redolent of James Bond moviesand Kipling ballads.After all, what constitutes a world leader?If it's population, we're on course to top the charts.We will overtake China by 2034.Is it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.The Americans have even recognized it,in an agreement.Is it the economy? Well, we have nowthe fifth-largest economy in the worldin purchasing power parity terms.And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,we grew at 6.7 percent.But, somehow, none of that adds up to me,to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,in this part of the 21st century.And so I wondered, couldwhat the future beckons for India to be all aboutbe a combination of these things allied to something else,the power of example,the attraction of India's culture,what, in other words, people like to call "soft power."Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,Joseph Nye, a friend of mine.And, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,it's essentially the ability of a country to attract othersbecause of its culture, its political values,its foreign policies.And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,but we know the Alliance Francaiseis all about French soft power, the British Council.The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.But, the fact is, in fact,that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonaldshave done more for American soft poweraround the world than any specifically government activity.So soft power is something that really emergespartly because of governments,but partly despite governments.And in the information era we all live in today,what we might call the TED age,I'd say that countries are increasingly being judgedby a global public that's been fedon an incessant diet of Internet news,of televised images,of cellphone videos, of email gossip.In other words, all sorts of communication devicesare telling us the stories of countries,whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.Now, in this age, again, countries with accessto multiple channels of communicationand information have a particular advantage.And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.India has more all-news TV channelsthan any country in the world,in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.But, the fact still is that it's not just that.In order to have soft power, you have to be connected.One might argue that India has becomean astonishingly connected country.I think you've already heard the figures.We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.Currently there are 509 million cellphonesin Indian hands, in India.And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.In fact, those 15 million cellphonesare the most connections that any country,including the U.S. and China,has ever established in the history of telecommunications.But, what perhaps some of you don't realizeis how far we've come to get there.You know, when I grew up in India,telephones were a rarity.In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliamenthad the right to allocate 15 telephone linesas a favor to those they deemed worthy.If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessmanor an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.But sometimes it just sat there.I went to high school in Calcutta.And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.But half the time we would pick it upwith an expectant look on our faces,there would be no dial tone.If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.In fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello."(Laughter)If you then wanted to connect to another city,let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,you'd have to book something called a trunk call,and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.Or you could pay eight times the going ratefor something called a lightning call.But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.In fact, so woeful was our telephone servicethat a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly mannerthat in a developing countrycommunications are a luxury, not a right,that the government had no obligation to provide better service,and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting listfor telephones in India.Now, fast-forward to today and this is what you see:the 15 million cell phones a month.But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cartthat looks like it was designed in the 16th century,wielding a coal-fired steam ironthat might have been invented in the 18th century.He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.The other day I was in Kerala, my home state,at the country farm of a friend,about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.And it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?"And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drinkon a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,and a voice said, "I'm up here."And right on top of the nearest coconut tree,with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,was a local toddy tapper,who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coastto find out where they get the best possible prices.Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking laborto find out if the market town was open,if the market was on,whether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudgeto the market town to get that information and come back,then they'd load the cart.Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.So this empowerment of the underclassis the real result of India being connected.And that transformation is part of where India is heading today.But, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarizedin the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump --Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me --and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.And the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad."And the second goat says, "No, the book was better."(Laughter)I usually tend to think that the book is usually better,but, having said that,the fact is that Bollywood is nowtaking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate motherin a village in Senegaltakes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,just to watch a Bollywood movie.She can't understand the dialogue.She's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.And this is happening more and more.Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problemAfghanistan is for so many of us in the world.India doesn't have a military mission there.You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?One simple fact:you couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.Why? Because that was the momentwhen the Indian television soap opera,"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.Every Afghan family wanted to watch it.They had to suspend functions at 8:30.Weddings were reported to be interruptedso guests could cluster around the T.V. set,and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch --so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency --about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,any moving part they could find, at 8:30,because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,"Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi."(Laughter)That's soft power. And that is what India is developingthrough the "E" part of TED:its own entertainment industry.The same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples --but it's true of our music, of our dance,of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurantssince I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North Americaand not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.But, today in Britain, for example,Indian restaurants in Britainemploy more people than the coal mining,ship building and iron and steel industries combined.So the empire can strike back.(Applause)But, with this increasing awareness of India,with you and with I, and so on,with tales like Afghanistan,comes something vital in the information era,the sense that in today's worldit's not the side of the bigger army that wins,it's the country that tells a better story that prevails.And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.as a student in the mid '70s,I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewherespeak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technologywith the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.I had a friend, a history major like me,who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,by an anxiously perspiring European saying,"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?"(Laughter)We've gone from the image of India asland of fakirs lying on beds of nails,and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,computer wizards, software gurus.But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.But, there is something more substantive to that.The story rests on a fundamental platformof political pluralism.It's a civilizational story to begin with.Because India has been an open society for millennia.India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first templeby the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.In fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas,landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state,somewhere around 52 A.D.,he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.And to this day remains the only Jewish diasporain the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountereda single incident of anti-semitism.(Applause)That's the Indian story.Islam came peacefully to the south,slightly more differently complicated history in the north.But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting populationkeeps growing by 20 million a year.But, the fact isthat the last elections, five years ago,gave the world extraordinary phenomenonof an election being won by a woman political leaderof Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,to be sworn in as Prime Ministerby a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,in a country 81 percent Hindu.(Applause)This is India, and of course it's all the more strikingbecause it was four years later that we all applaudedthe U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,more than 220 years of free and fair elections,which took till last year to elect a president or a vice presidentwho wasn't white, male or Christian.So, maybe -- oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon --and he is male, but he isn't white.All the others have been all those three.(Laughter)All his predecessors have been all those three,and that's the point I was trying to make.(Laughter)But, the issue isthat when I talked about that example,it's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.Because ultimately, that electoral outcomehad nothing to do with the rest of the world.It was essentially India being itself.And ultimately, it seems to me,that always works better than propaganda.Governments aren't very good at telling stories.But people see a society for what it is,and that, it seems to me, is what ultimatelywill make a difference in today's information era,in today's TED age.So India now is no longerthe nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,we've every religion know to mankind,with the possible exception of Shintoism,though that has some Hindu elements somewhere.We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.And those of you who cashed your money heremight be surprised to see how many scripts there areon the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.We've got all of that.We don't even have geography uniting us,because the natural geography of the subcontinentframed by the mountains and the sea was hackedby the partition with Pakistan in 1947.In fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,because the name "India" comes from the river Indus,which flows in Pakistan.But, the whole point is that Indiais the nationalism of an idea.It's the idea of an ever-ever-land,emerging from an ancient civilization,united by a shared history,but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.And it's the nationalism of an idea thatessentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,and still rally around a consensus.And the consensus is of a very simple principle,that in a diverse plural democracy like Indiayou don't really have to agree on everything all the time,so long as you agree on the ground rulesof how you will disagree.The great success story of India,a country that so many learned scholars and journalistsassumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.And I do want to make the pointthat if there is anything worth celebrating about India,it isn't military muscle, economic power.All of that is necessary,but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.We can't really be both of those.We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with thehardware of development,the ports, the roads, the airports,all the infrastructural things we need to do,and the software of development,the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in Indiato be able to have a couple of square meals a day,to be able to send his or her childrento a decent school,and to aspire to work a jobthat will give them opportunities in their livesthat can transform themselves.But, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.But, it's all taking place in an open society,in a rich and diverse and plural civilization,in one that is determined to liberate and fulfillthe creative energies of its people.That's why India belongs at TED,and that's why TED belongs in India.Thank you very much.(Applause)

One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.Under a tree she saw a womanmeditating furiously.The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri.She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree.Just then, with a loud bang,the heavens opened. (Claps)And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri.Ah-hah.The woman paid him no heed.So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor,and proceeded to rape her.Then Indra disappeared. (Clap! Clap!)And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared.He realized at once what had happened.So, he petitioned the higher godsso that he may have justice.So, the god Vishnu arrived."Are there any witnesses?""Just a one-eyed monkey," said the Brahmin.Now, the one-eyed monkeyreally wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice,so she retold events exactly as they had happened.Vishnu gave his judgment."The god Indra has sinned,in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin.May he be called to wash away his sins."So, Indra arrived,and performed the sacrifice of the horse.And so it transpiredthat a horse was killed,a god was made sin-free,a Brahmin's ego was appeased,a woman ... was ruined,and a one-eyed monkey was left ...very confused at what we humans call justice.In India there is a rape every three minutes.In India, only 25 percent of rapescome to a police station,and of these 25 percent that come to a police station,convictions are only in four percent of the cases.That's a lot of women who don't get justice.And it's not only about women.Look around you, look at your own countries.There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail.If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis,our tribals, the Naxalites.If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks.There is a trend here.And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story,always get to tell their truth as The Truth.So, have we all becomeone-eyed -- two-eyed instead of one-eyed -- monkeys?Have we stopped seeing injustice?Good morning.(Applause)You know, I have told this storyclose to 550 times,in audiences in 40 countries,to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth,and every time it hits something.Now, if I were to go into the same crowdand say, "I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,"they would say, "Thank you very much, we have other things to do."And that is the astonishing power of art.Art can go through where other things can't.You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices,breaks through everything that you have as your mask,that says, "I am this, I am that, I am that."No. It breaks through those.And it reaches somewhere where other things don't.And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change,we need a language that reaches through.Hitler knew it; he used Wagnerto make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atopthis huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth.And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies,and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require,they also know the power of the arts.For me it came very early.When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer,came upon a phenomenon that worried her.It was a phenomenon where young brideswere committing suicide in rural Gujarat,because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families.And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.He came to talk to her and said, "What is this about?"She told him and he set out the first inquiryinto what today we call Dowry Dance.Imagine a dance piecefor the first inquiry into somethingthat even today kills thousands of women.Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brookin "The Mahabharata" playing this feisty feminine feministcalled Draupadi, I had similar experiences.Big fat black mamas in the Bronxused to come and say, "Hey girl, that's it!"And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,"Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça? Ça!"And then aboriginal women in Africawould come and say, "This is it!"And I thought, "This is what we need,as a language."We had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health.Well, millions of people around the world dieof waterborne disease every year.And that's because there is no clean water to drink,or in countries like India,people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation.So, what do they do?They drink the water they know is dirty,they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundiceand they die.And governments have not been able to provide clean water.They try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.So what do you do? Do you let them die?Well, somebody had a great idea.And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybodybut would help health in every field.Most houses in Asia and Indiahave a cotton garment.And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this,that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over,can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through.So, why aren't governments blaring this on television?Why isn't it on every poster across the third world?Because there is no profit in it.Because nobody can get a kickback.But it still needs to get to people.And here is one of the ways we get it to people.[Video] Woman: Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.Man: You know how expensive those are.I have a solution that requires neither machine,nor wood, nor cooking gas.Woman: What solution?Man: Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have.Boy: Grand-dad, tell me the solution please.Man: I will tell all of you. Just wait.Woman: Here father. (Man: Is it clean?) Woman: Yes, of course.Man: Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds.Woman: All right, father.Man: And you, you count that she does it right. (Boy: All right, grand-dad.)Man: One, two, three, four folds we make.All the germs from the water we take.Chorus: One, two, three, four folds we make.All the germs from the water we take.Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.Our drinking water safe we make.Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.Our drinking water safe we make.Woman: Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari.Man: So this is the cotton sari.And through this we will have clean water.(Applause)I think it's safe to say that all of us hereare deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution,and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders,we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage,or whether it's domestic violence,whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing herbecause she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere.So, why are we not doing somethingto actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?What are we doing to try and make childrenand young people realizethat violence is something that we indulge in,that we can stop,and that there are other ways of actuallytaking violence, taking anger, taking frustrationsinto different things that do not harm other people.Well, here is one such way.(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people.Your parents were peaceful people.Your grandparents were peaceful people.So much peace in one place?How could it be otherwise?(Music)But, what if ...Yes. What if ...One little gene in youhas been trying to get through?From your beginnings in Africa,through each generation, may be passed on to you,in your creation. It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you.And if it's in you, then it's in me too. Oh, dear.It's what made you smack your baby brother,stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother.It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside,when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide.Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work,and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear.And as for outsiders, white, black or brown,tar and feather them, and whip them out of town.It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection.Adrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will.Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it.You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln.Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi.Goodbye, Martin Luther King.Hello, gangs from this neighborhoodkilling gangs from that neighborhood.Hello governments of rich countriesselling arms to governments of poor countrieswho can't even afford to give them food.Hello civilization. Hello, 21st century.Look what we've ...look what they've done.(Applause)Mainstream art, cinema,has been used across the world to talk about social issues.A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti,which suddenly spawned thousands of young peoplewanting to volunteer for social change.In Venezuela, one of the most popularsoap operas has a heroine called Crystal.And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer,75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done.And of course, "The Vagina Monologues" we know about.And there are stand-up comicswho are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues.So, why is it,that if we think that we all agreethat we need a better world,we need a more just world,why is it that we are not using the one languagethat has consistently showed usthat we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?What I need to say to the planners of the world,the governments, the strategistsis, "You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake.It needs to be the yeast."Because, any future planning,if 2048 is when we want to get there,unless the arts are put with the scientists,with the economists,with all those who prepare for the future, badly,we're not going to get there.And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen.So, what is it that we require? What is it that we need?We need to break down our visionof what planners are,of what the correct way of a path is.And to say all these years of tryingto make a better world, and we have failed.There are more people being raped. There are more wars.There are more people dying of simple things.So, something has got to give. And that is what I want.Can I have my last audio track please?Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully.(Whistling)Her father the king said, "Don't whistle."Her mother the queen said, "Hai, don't whistle."But the princess continued whistling.(Whistling)The years went by and the princess grew upinto a beautiful young woman,who whistled even more beautifully.(Whistling)Her father the king said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"Her mother the queen said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"But the king had an idea.He announced a Swayamvara.He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling."Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdomand her hand in marriage!"Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.(Whistling)Some whistled badly.Some whistled well.But nobody could defeat the princess."Now what shall we do?" said the king."Now what shall we do?" said the queen.But the princess said, "Father, Mother, don't worry.I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young menand I am going to ask themif they defeated correctly.And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."So she went up to each and said, "Do you accept that I have defeated you?"And they said, "Me? Defeated by a woman?No way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible."Till finally one prince said,"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me.""Uh-huh ..." she said."Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."(Whistling)Thank you.(Applause)



cynthia_schneider_the_surprising_spread_of_idol_tv

I'd like to ask you,what do these three people have in common?Well, you probably recognize the first person.I'm sure you're all avid "American Idol" watchers.But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani,who is a contestant, indeed a finalist,in the Poet of the Millions competition,which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi,and seen throughout the Arab world.In this contestpeople have to write and reciteoriginal poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry,which is the traditional Bedouin form.And Lima Sahar was a finalistin the Afghan Star singing competition.Now, before I go any further,yes, I know it all began with "Britain's Got Talent."But my point in discussing thisis to show you -- I hope I'll be able to show youhow these merit-based competitions,with equal access to everyone,with the winner selected via voting by SMS,are changing tribal societies.And I'm going to focus on Afghanistanand the Arab world with the UAE,how they're changing tribal societies,not by introducing Western ideas,but by being integrated into the language in those places.It all begins with enjoyment.Video: We are late to watch "Afghan Star."We are going to watch "Afghan Star." We are late.We are running late.We must go to watch "Afghan Star."Cynthia Schneider: These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society.In Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengthsto be able to watch this program.And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set.People watch it all over the countryalso in public places.But it goes beyond watching,because also, part of thisis campaigning.People become so engagedthat they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway,who fan out over the countryside,campaigning for their candidate.Contestants also put themselves forward.Now, of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely.Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group.This has opened up the door,particularly for women.And in the last season there were two women in the finalists.One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar,a very conservative part of the country.And here she relates, in the documentary film "Afghan Star,"how her friends urged her not to do thisand told her that she was leaving them for democracy.But she also confides thatshe knows that members of the Talibanare actually SMS-ing votes in for her.Aydah Al Jahnani also took risksand put herself out, to competein the Poet of the Millions competition.I have to say, her husband backed her from the start.But her tribe and family urged her not to competeand were very much against it.But, once she started to win,then they got behind her again.It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.And she's out there.Her poetry is about women,and the life of women in society.So just by presenting herselfand being in competition with men --this shows the voting on the program --it sets a very important example for young women --these are young women in the audience of the program --in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.Now you'd think that "American Idol"would introduce a measure of Americanization.But actually, just the opposite is happening.By using this engaging popular formatfor traditional, local culture,it actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revivalof interest in Nabati poetry,also in traditional dress and dance and music.And for Afghanistan,where the Taliban banned music for many years,it is reintroducing their traditional music.They don't sing pop songs,they sing Afghan music.And they also have learned how to lose gracefully,without avenging the winner.(Laughter)No small thing.And the final, sort of, formulationof this "American Idol" format,which has just appeared in Afghanistan,is a new program called "The Candidate."And in this program, people presentpolicy platforms that are then voted on.Many of them are too young to run for president,but by putting the issues out there,they are influencing the presidential race.So for me, the substance of things unseenis how reality TV is driving reality.Thank you.(Applause)



julian_treasure_the_4_ways_sound_affects_us
1464316

Over the next five minutes,my intention is to transform your relationship with sound.Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental,and much of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise)We stand on street corners, shouting over noise like this,and pretending that it doesn't exist.Well, this habit of suppressing sound has meant that ourrelationship with sound has become largely unconscious.There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time,and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today.First is physiological. (Loud alarm clocks)Sorry about that. I've just given you a shot of cortisol, your fight/flight hormone.Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time,but also your breathing, your heart rate -- which I just also did --and your brainwaves.It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it.This is surf. (Ocean waves)It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute.Most people find that very soothing,and, interestingly, 12 cycles per minuteis roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human.There is a deep resonance with being at rest.We also associate it with being stress-freeand on holiday.The second way in which sound affects you is psychological.Music is the most powerful form of sound that we knowthat affects our emotional state. (Albinoni's Adagio)This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sadif I leave it on.Music is not the only kind of sound, however, which affects your emotions.Natural sound can do that too.Birdsong, for example, is a sound which most peoplefind reassuring. (Birds chirping)There is a reason for that. Over hundreds of thousands of yearswe've learned that when the birds are singing, things are safe.It's when they stop you need to be worried.The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively.You can't understand two people talking at once ("If you're listening to this version of")("me you're on the wrong track.") or in this case one person talking twice.Try and listen to the other one. ("You have to choose which me you're going to listen to.")We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input,which is why noise like this -- (Office noise) --is extremely damaging for productivity.If you have to work in an open-plan office like this,your productivity is greatly reduced.And whatever number you're thinking of, it probably isn't as bad as this.(Ominous music)You are one third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.And I have a tip for you. If you have to work in spaces like that,carry headphones with you, with a soothing sound like birdsong.Put them on and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be.The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally.With all that other stuff going on, it would be amazingif our behavior didn't change.(Techno music inside a car) So, ask yourself: Is this person ever going to driveat a steady 28 miles per hour? I don't think so.At the simplest, you move away from unpleasant soundand towards pleasant sounds.So if I were to play this -- (Jackhammer) --for more than a few seconds, you'd feel uncomfortable;for more than a few minutes, you'd be leaving the room in droves.For people who can't get away from noise like that,it's extremely damaging for their health.And that's not the only thing that bad sound damages.Most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental, and even hostile,and it has a dramatic effect on sales.For those of you who are retailers, you may want to look awaybefore I show this slide.They are losing up to 30 percent of their businesswith people leaving shops faster, or just turning around on the door.We all have done it, leaving the areabecause the sound in there is so dreadful.I want to spend just a moment talking aboutthe model that we've developed, which allows us to start at the topand look at the drivers of sound, analyze the soundscapeand then predict the four outcomes I've just talked about.Or start at the bottom,and say what outcomes do we want,and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect.At last we've got some science we can apply.And we're in the business of designing soundscapes.Just a word on music. Music is the most powerful sound there is,often inappropriately deployed.It's powerful for two reasons. You recognize it fast,and you associate it very powerfully.I'll give you two examples. (First chord of The Beatles' "A Hard Day's Night")Most of you recognize that immediately.The younger, maybe not. (Laughter)(First two notes of "Jaws" theme) And most of you associate that with something!Now, those are one-second samples of music.Music is very powerful. And unfortunatelyit's veneering commercial spaces, often inappropriately.I hope that's going to change over the next few years.Let me just talk about brands for a moment,because some of you run brands. Every brand is out theremaking sound right now.There are eight expressions of a brand in sound.They are all important. And every brand needs to have guidelines at the center.I'm glad to say that is starting to happen now.(Intel ad jingle)You all recognize that one. (Nokia ringtone) This is themost-played tune in the world today.1.8 billion times a day, that tune is played.And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing.Just leave you with four golden rules, for those of you who run businesses,for commercial sound.First, make it congruent,pointing in the same direction as your visual communication.That increases impact by over 1,100 percent.If your sound is pointing the opposite direction, incongruent,you reduce impact by 86 percent.That's an order of magnitude, up or down.This is important.Secondly, make it appropriate to the situation.Thirdly, make it valuable. Give people something with the sound.Don't just bombard them with stuff.And, finally, test and test it again.Sound is complex. There are many countervailing influences.It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens.So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness.If you're listening consciously,you can take control of the sound around you.It's good for your health. It's good for your productivity.If we all do that we move to a statethat I like to think will be sound living in the world.I'm going to leave you with a little bit more birdsong. (Birds chirping)I recommend at least five minutes a day, but there is no maximum dose.Thank you for lending me your ears today.(Applause)



david_hanson_robots_that_relate_to_you
862064

I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.And by that, I meanthat I develop robots that are characters,but also robots that will eventuallycome to empathize with you.So we're starting with a variety of technologiesthat have converged into these conversational character robotsthat can see faces, make eye contact with you,make a full range of facial expressions, understand speechand begin to model how you're feelingand who you are, and build a relationship with you.I developed a series of technologiesthat allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressionsthan previously achieved, on lower power,which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.So, it's a full range of facial expressionssimulating all the major muscles in the human face,running on very small batteries,extremely lightweight.The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressionsis a material that we call Frubber,and it actually has three major innovationsin the material that allow this to happen.One is hierarchical pores,and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.There he's starting to walk.This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.I built the head. They built the body.So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines,and not just sentience, but empathy.We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratoryat the U.C. San Diego.They have this really remarkable facial expression technologythat recognizes facial expressions,what facial expressions you're making.It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation.We're emulating all the major facial expressions,and then controlling it with the softwarethat we call the Character Engine.And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.In fact, right now -- plug it from here, and then plug it in here,and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions.Okay. So I'm smiling.(Laughter)Now I'm frowning.And this is really heavily backlit.Okay, here we go.Oh, it's so sad.Okay, so you smile, frowning.So his perception of your emotional statesis very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.Machines are becoming devastatingly capableof things like killing. Right?Those machines have no place for empathy.And there is billions of dollars being spent on that.Character robotics could plant the seedfor robots that actually have empathy.So, if they achieve human level intelligenceor, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence,this could be the seeds of hope for our future.So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D.And then I started Hanson Robotics,which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.This is one of our robotsthat we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.And it sees multiple people in a scene,remembers where individual people are,and looks from person to person, remembering people.So, we're involving two things.One, the perception of people,and two, the natural interface,the natural form of the interface,so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.You start to believe that it's alive and aware.So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff togetherin an artistic display of an android portraitof science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick,who wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"which was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner."In these stories, robots often thinkthat they're human, and they sort of come to life.So we put his writings, letters,his interviews, correspondences,into a huge database of thousands of pages,and then used some natural language processingto allow you to actually have a conversation with him.And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these thingsthat just sounded like they really understood you.And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing,which is a little character that's a spokesbotfor friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.And we're getting this mass-manufactured.We specked it out to actually be doablewith a very, very low-cost bill of materials,so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. That's incredible.(Applause)



sam_martin_builds_a_room_of_his_own
701403

So, I am indeed going to talk aboutthe spaces men create for themselves,but first I want to tell you why I'm here.I'm here for two reasons. These two guysare my two sons Ford and Wren.When Ford was about three years old,we shared a very small room together,in a very small space.My office was on one half of the bedroom,and his bedroom was on the other half.And you can imagine, if you're a writer,that things would get really crowded around deadlines.So when Wren was on the way,I realized I needed to find a space of my own.There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard,and without any previous building experience,and about 3,000 dollars and somerecycled materials, I built this space.It had everything I needed. It was quiet.There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.As I was building this space, I thoughtto myself, "Surely I'm not the only guyto have to have carved out a space for his own."So I did some research.And I found that there was an historic precedence.Hemingway had his writing space.Elvis had two or three manspaces,which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude,and there was, of course, the Batcave.So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journeyand see what guys were creating for themselves now.Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas,which is where I'm from.On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.But on the inside, it's anything but.And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.It has neon concert posters, a barand, of course, the leg lamp,which is very important.I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard,out of landscaping timbers, astroturf.And he found the scoreboard in the trash.Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.This a 1923 wooden tugboat,made completely out of Douglas fir.The guy did it all himself.And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.So, pretty early on in my investigationsI realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find,which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramidsand overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.There were definitely hang-out spots.But some were for working, some were for playing,some were for guys to collect their things.Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.Take this place for example.On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.This is in Long Island, New York.The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.On the inside it's a recreation of a16th century Japanese tea house.The man imported all the materials from Japan,and he hired a Japanese carpenterto build it in the traditional style.It has no nails or screws.All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.But you open one of the garage doorsand there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.(Laughter)And so there is a good reason for this.It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.He won the silver medal for Irelandin the 1992 Olympics,and he trains in this space. He trains other people.And right off the garage he has his own trophy roomwhere he can sort of bask in his accomplishments,which is another sort of important part about a manspace.So, while this space represents someone's profession,this one certainly represents a passion.It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.Museum quality.So, as I came to the end of my journey,I found over 50 spaces.And they were unexpected and they were surprising.But they were also --I was really impressed by how personalized they were,and how much work went into them.And I realized that's because the guys that I metwere all very passionate about what they did.And they really loved their professions.And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.And so they created these spacesto reflect what they love to do,and who they were.So if you don't have a space of your own,I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.Thank you very much.(Applause)

I'm extremely excited to be given the opportunityto come and speak to you todayabout what I consider to bethe biggest stunt on Earth.Or perhaps not quite on Earth.A parachute jump from the very edge of space.More about that a bit later on.What I'd like to do first is take you througha very brief helicopter ride of stuntsand the stunts industry in the movies and in television,and show you how technologyhas started to interface with the physical skillsof the stunt performerin a way that makes the stunts biggerand actually makes them safer than they've ever been before.I've been a professional stunt man for 13 years.I'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stuntsI often design them.During that time, health and safety has become everything about my job.It's critical now that when a car crash happensit isn't just the stunt person we make safe, it's the crew.We can't be killing camera men. We can't be killing stunt men.We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set,or any passerby. So, safety is everything.But it wasn't always that way.In the old days of the silent movies --Harold Lloyd here, hanging famously from the clock hands --a lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable.They had no safety, no real technology.What safety they had was very scant.This is the first stunt woman,Rosie Venger, an amazing woman.You can see from the slide, very very strong.She really paved the wayat a time when nobody was doing stunts, let alone women.My favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt.Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight.He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you seein the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated.This is a screen capture from "Stagecoach,"where Yakima Canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts I've ever seen.There is no safety, no back support,no pads, no crash mats, no sand pits in the ground.That's one of the most dangerous horse stunts, certainly.Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date,some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts.We couldn't do them without technology.These are particularly dangerousbecause there is no mask on my face.They were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper,one for FHM magazine.Highly dangerous, but also you'll noticeit doesn't look as though I'm wearing anything underneath the suit.The fire suits of old, the bulky suits, the thick woolen suits,have been replaced with modern materialslike Nomex or, more recently, Carbonex --fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionalsto burn for longer, look more spectacular, and in pure safety.Here's a bit more.There's a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for.One of the things that a stuntman often does,and you'll see it every time in the big movies,is be blown through the air.Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had.And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air,and hopefully you make it look good.Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram.It's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer,because it will break your legs very, very quicklyif you land on it wrong.Having said that, it works with compressed nitrogen.And that's in the up position. When you step on it,either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot,it will fire you, depending on the gas pressure,anything from five feet to 30 feet.I could, quite literally, fire myself into the gallery.Which I'm sure you wouldn't want.Not today.Car stunts are another areawhere technology and engineeringadvances have made life easier for us, and safer.We can do bigger car stunts than ever before now.Being run over is never easy.That's an old-fashioned, hard, gritty, physical stunt.But we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane --the materials that help us, when we're hit like this,not to hurt ourselves too much.The picture in the bottom right-hand corner thereis of some crash test dummy work that I was doing.Showing how stunts work in different areas, really.And testing breakaway signpost pillars.A company makes a Lattix pillar, which is a network,a lattice-type pillar that collapses when it's hit.The car on the left drove into the steel pillar.And you can't see it from there, but the engine was in the driver's lap.They did it by remote control.I drove the other one at 60 miles an hour, exactly the same speed,and clearly walked away from it.Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology.We used to have to drive up a ramp, and we still do sometimes.But now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon.You can just see, underneath the car, there is a black rod on the floorby the wheel of the other car.That's the piston that was fired out of the floor.We can flip lorries, coaches, buses, anything overwith a nitrogen cannon with enough power. (Laughs)It's a great job, really. (Laughter)It's such fun!You should hearsome of the phone conversations that I have with peopleon my Bluetooth in the shop."Well, we can flip the bus over, we can have it burst into flames,and how about someone, you know, big explosion."And people are looking like this ...(Laughs)I sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are.The next thing that I'd like to show you is something thatDunlop asked me to do earlier this yearwith our Channel Five's "Fifth Gear Show."A loop-the-loop, biggest in the world.Only one person had ever done it before.Now, the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be,"Let's hit this as fast as possible. 60 miles an hour.Let's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor."Well, you'd die if you did that.We went to Cambridge University, the other university,and spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there,a physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour.Even then, I caught seven Gand lost a bit of consciousness on the way in.That's a long way to fall, if you get it wrong. That was just about right.So again, science helps us, and with the engineering too --the modifications to the car and the wheel.High falls, they're old fashioned stunts.What's interesting about high fallsis that although we use airbags,and some airbags are quite advanced,they're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to,if you land a bit wrong. So, they're a much safer proposition.Just basically though, it is a basic piece of equipment.It's a bouncy castlewith slats in the side to allow the air to escape.That's all it is, a bouncy castle.That's the only reason we do it. See, it's all fun, this job.What's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes.They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them.And that's interesting because they are almost retrospective.They're great for catching you, up to certain heights.And on the other side of the fence,that physical art, the physical performance of the stuntman,has interfaced with the very highesttechnology in I.T. and in software.Not the cardboard box, but the green screen.This is a shot of "Terminator," the movie.Two stunt guys doing what I consider to be a rather benign stunt.It's 30 feet. It's water. It's very simple.With the green screen we can put any background in the world on it,moving or still,and I can assure you, nowadays you can't see the joint.This is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing.Completely in the safety of a studio,and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took,and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by.Decelerator rigs and wires, we use them a lot.We fly people on wires, like this.This guy is not skydiving. He's being flown like a kite,or moved around like a kite.And this is a Guinness World Record attempt.They asked me to open their 50th anniversary show in 2004.And again, technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters,and stop within a couple of feet of the groundwithout melting the rope with the friction,because of the alloys I used in the descender device.And that's Centre Point in London.We brought Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road to a standstill.Helicopter stunts are always fun,hanging out of them, whatever.And aerial stunts. No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving.Which brings us quite nicely to why I'm really here today:Project Space Jump.In 1960, Joseph Kittenger of the United States Air Forcedid the most spectacular thing.He did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise,and he did it to test high altitude systemsfor military pilotsin the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so.And I'd just like to show you a little footageof what he did back then.And just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind.Project Excelsior, it was called.There were three jumps.They first dropped some dummies.So that's the balloon, big gas balloon.It's that shape because the helium has to expand.My balloon will expand to 500 timesand look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top.These are the dummies being dropped from 100,000 feet,and there is the camera that's strapped to them.You can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude.And I'm planning to go from 120,000 feet,which is about 22 miles.You're in a near vacuum in that environment,which is in minus 50 degrees.So it's an extremely hostile place to be.This is Joe Kittenger himself.Bear in mind, ladies and gents, this was 1960.He didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man.I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.He's a very humble and wonderful human being.He sent me an email, saying, "If you get this thing off the groundI wish you all the best." And he signed it, "Happy landings,"which I thought was quite lovely.He's in his 80s and he lives in Florida. He's a tremendous guy.This is him in a pressure suit.Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude iswhen you get to 30,000 feet -- it's great, isn't it? --When you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen.Above 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet,you need pressure breathing, which is where you're wearing a G suit.This is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there,pushing him in, those turned up jeans.You need a pressure suit.You need a pressure breathing systemwith a G suit that squeezes you, that helps you to breathe inand helps you to exhale.Above 50,000 feet you need a space suit, a pressure suit.Certainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly.Not even a jet engine.It needs to be rocket-powered or one of these things,a great big gas balloon.It took me a while; it took me years to find the right balloon teamto build the balloon that would do this job.I've found that team in America now.And it's made of polyethylene, so it's very thin.We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps,and two balloons for the main jump, because theynotoriously tear on takeoff.They're just so, so delicate.This is the step off. He's written on that thing,"The highest step in the world."And what must that feel like?I'm excited and I'm scared,both at the same time in equal measures.And this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbledbefore his drogue chute opened to stabilize him.A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down.You can just see them there, popping open.Those are the drogue chutes. He had three of them.I did quite a lot of research.And you'll see in a second there, he comes back down to the floor.Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon,the little black dots are people.It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.That's in New Mexico.That's the U.S. Air Force Museum.And they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like.My gondola will be more simple than that.It's a three sided box, basically.So I've had to do quite a lot of training.This is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains,training in preparation for some high altitude jumps.This is what the view is going to be likeat 90,000 feet for me.Now you may think this is justa thrill-seeking trip, a pleasure ride,just the world's biggest stunt.Well there's a little bit more to it than that.Trying to find a space suit to do thishas led me to an area of technologythat I never really expected when I set about doing this.I contacted a company in the Stateswho make suits for NASA.That's a current suit. This was me last year with their chief engineer.That suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars.And it weighs 300 pounds and you can't skydive in it.So I've been stuck. For the past 15 years I've been trying to find a space suitthat would do this job, or someone that will make one.Something revolutionary happeneda little while ago, at the same facility.That's the prototype of the parachute. I've now had them custom make one,the only one of its kind in the world. And that's the only suit of its kind in the world.It was made by a Russian that's designedmost of the suits of the past18 years for the Soviets.He left the company because he saw,as some other people in the space suit industry,an emerging market for space suits for space tourists.You know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feetand the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen.If you're at 100,000 feet you die.In six seconds you've lost consciousness. In 10 seconds you're dead.Your blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization.The body swells up. It's awful.And so we expect -- it's not much fun.We expect, and others expect,that perhaps the FAA, the CAAmight say, "You need to put someone in a suitthat's not inflated, that's connected to the aircraft."Then they're comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor.And then if the cabin depressurizeswhile the aircraft is coming back down,in whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay.I would like to bring Costa on, if he's here,to show you the only one of its kind in the world.I was going to wear it,but I thought I'd get Costa to do it, my lovely assistant.Thank you. He's very hot. Thank you, Costa.This is the communication headset you'll seeon lots of space suits.It's a two-layer suit. NASA suits have got 13 layers.This is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about 15 pounds.It's next to nothing. Especially designed for me.It's a working prototype. I will use it for all the jumps.Would you just give us a little twirl, please, Costa?Thank you very much.And it doesn't look far different when it's inflated,as you can see from the picture down there.I've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel,which means that I can practice everything I need to practice, in safety,before I ever jump out of anything. Thanks very much, Costa.(Applause)Ladies and gentlemen, that's just about it from me.The status of my mission at the momentis it still needs a major sponsor.I'm confident that we'll find one.I think it's a great challenge.And I hope that you will agree with me,it is the greatest stunt on Earth.Thank you very much for your time.(Applause)



emmanuel_jal_the_music_of_a_war_child
722453

I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal.And I come from a long way.I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me.It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world,telling my story in form of a book.And also telling it like now.And also, the easiest one waswhen I was doing it in form of a music.So I have branded myself as a war child.I'm doing thisbecause of an old lady in my village now,who have lost her children.There is no newspaper to cover her pain,and what she wants to change in this society.And I'm doing it for a young manwho want to create a change and has no way to project his voicebecause he can't write.Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace,YouTube, for them to talk.Also one thing that kept me pushing this story,this painful stories out, the dreams I have,sometimes, is like the voices of the dead,that I have seenwould tell me, "Don't give up. Keep on going."Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it,because I didn't know what I was putting myself into.Well I was born in the most difficult time,when my country was at war.I saw my village burned down.The world that meant a lot to me, I saw itvanish in my face.I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five.My mother was claimed by the war.My brothers and sisters were scattered.And up to now, me and my fatherwere detached and I still have issues with him.Seeing people die every day,my mother crying,it's like I was raised in a violence.And that made me call myself a war child.And not only that, when I was eightI became a child soldier.I didn't know what was the war for.But one thing I knewwas an image that I saw that stuck in my head.When I went to the training camp I say,"I want to kill as many Muslims,and as many Arabs, as possible."The training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force,because I wanted to revenge for my family.I wanted to revenge for my village.Luckily now things have changedbecause I came to discover the truth.What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims,wasn't the Arabs.It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system,and using religion to get what they want to get out of us,which is the oil, the diamond,the gold and the land.So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose:should I continue to hate, or let it go?So I happened to forgive. Now I singmusic with the Muslims. I dance with them.I even had a movie out called "War Child,"funded by Muslim people.So that pain has gone out.But my story is huge.So I'm just going to go into a different step now,which is easier for me.I'm going to give you poemcalled "Forced to Sin,"which is from my album "War Child."I talk about my story.One of the journey that I treadwhen I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no foodand we were like around 400.And only 16 people survived that journey.So I hope you're going to hear this.My dreams are like torment.My every moment.Voices in my brain, of friends that was slain.Friends like Lual who died by my side,of starvation.In the burning jungle, and the desert plain.Next was I, but Jesus heard my cry.As I was tempted to eat the rotten fleshof my comrade,he gave me comfort.We used to raid villages,stealing chickens, goats and sheeps,anything we could eat.I knew it was rude, but we needed food.And therefore I was forced to sin,forced to sin to make a living,forced to sin to make a living.Sometimes you gotta lose to win.Never give up. Never give in.Left home at the age of seven.One year later, live with an AK-47 by my side.Slept with one eye open wide.Run, duck, play dead and hide.I've seen my people die like flies.But I've never seen a dead body,at least one that I've killed.But still as I wonder, I won't go under.Guns barking like lightning and thunder.As a child so young and tender,Words I can't forget I still remember.I saw sergeant command raising his hand,no retreat, no surrender.I carry the banner of the trauma.War child, child without a mama,still fighting in the saga.Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama.No sit or stop, as I reach for the topI'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop.I'm on a fight, day and night.Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right.It's like I'm living a dream.First time I'm feeling like a human being.Ah! The children of Darfur.Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's youthat I'm fighting for.Left home.Don't even know the day I'll ever return.My country is war-torn.Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns.So many people die that I don't even cry no more.Ask God question, what am I here for.And why are my people poor.And why, why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write,I was learning how to fight.I ate snails, vultures, rabbits,snakes, and anything that had life.I was ready to eat.I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed?That's my story shared in the form of a lesson.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)What energized me and kept me going is the music I do.I never saw anybodyto tell my story to themso they could advise me or do therapy.So the music had been my therapy for me.It's been where I actually see heaven,where I can be happy,where I can be a child again, in dances, through music.So one thing I know about music:music is the only thing that has powerto enter your cell system,your mind, your heart,influence your soul and your spirit,and can even influence the way you livewithout even you knowing.Music is the only thing that canmake you want to wake up your bedand shake your leg,without even wanting to do it.And so the power music hasI normally compare to the power lovewhen love doesn't see a color.You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it.One testimony about how I find musicis powerful is whenI was still a soldier back then.I hated the people in the north.But I don't know why I don't hate their music.So we party and dance to their music.And one thing that shocked me is one daythey brought an Arab musicianto come and entertain the soldiers.And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music.But I had this question.So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is.So what's happening here?I've been in a painful journey.Today is day number 233in which I only eat dinner.I don't eat breakfast. No lunch.And I've done a campaign calledLose to Win.Where I'm losing so that I could winthe battle that I'm fighting now.So my breakfast, my lunch,I donate it to a charity that I foundedbecause we want to build a school in Sudan.And I'm doing this because alsoit's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day.Here I am in the West. I choose not to.So in my village now, kids there,they normally listen to BBC, or any radio,and they are waiting to know,the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfastit means he got the money to build our school.And so I made a commitment. I say,"I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month,but I've been humbled.(Laughter)So it's taken me 232 days.And I said, "No stop until we get it."And like it's been done on Facebook, MySpace.The people are giving three dollars.The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents.Somebody donated 20 cents online.I don't know how they did it.(Laughter)But that moved me.And so, the importance of education to meis what I'm willing to die for.I'm willing to die for this,because I know what it can do to my people.Education enlighten your brain,give you so many chances,and you're able to survive.As a nation we have been crippled.For so many years we have fed on aid.You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-oldfamilies in a refugee camps.They only get the food that drops from the sky, from the U.N.So these people,you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid.If anybody want to help usthis is what we need.Give us tools. Give the farmers tools.It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops.(Applause)Invest in education.Education so that we have strong institutionthat can create a revolution to change everything.Because we have all those old menthat are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon.But if you invest in educationthen we'll be able to change Africa.That's what I'm asking.(Applause)So in order to do that,I founded a charter called Gua Africa,where we put kids in school.And now we have a couple in university.We have like 40 kids, ex-child soldiersmixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support.And I said "I'm going to put it in practice."And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things.That's what I want to do to change,to make a difference in the world.Well now, my time is going,so I want to sing a song.But I'll ask you guys to stand upso we celebrate the life of a British aid workercalled Emma McCunethat made it possible for me to be here.I'm gonna sing this song,just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference.She came to my country and saw the importanceof education.She said the only way to help Sudanis to invest in the women, educating them,educating the children,so that they could come and create a revolutionin this complex society.So she even ended up marrying a commanderfrom the SPLA.And she rescued over 150 child soldiers.One of them happened to be me now.And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me.Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma?Audience: Yes!Emmanuel Jal: All right.♫ This one goes to Emma McCune ♫♫ Angel to rescue came one afternoon ♫♫ I'm here because you rescued me ♫♫ I'm proud to carry your legacy ♫♫ Thank you.

"The Better Man."I was the better at getting and keeping.You were the better at spend and spend;I was the better at grubbing and heaping,But who was the better man in the end?Yes, who was the better man, my friend?You were the better with lords and ladies,I was the better at pillaging Troy;You were the better at kissing the babies,I was the better at search and destroy.But who was the better man, old boy?Who was the better man?I was the better at improvisation,You were the better at spinning the plates;I was the better at procrastination,You were the better at quiet debate.But who was the better man, old mate?Who was the better man?You were the better at rolling a reefer,I was the better at coke and rum;Remember that night on the beach in Ibiza?The Maori twinswith the tattooed bum?But who was the better man, old chum?Who was the better man?Now we come down to it, relatives grieving.Out in the hall with their crocodile tears;Now that you're out of it, now that you're leaving,Now that they've sealed your arse and your ears,What I've been meaning to tell you for years,And years, and years, and years, old friend ...Is that you were the better man, in the end;You were the better man,My friend.(Applause)I wrote this next poem for my mother.Every one of us had a mother,only one --probably the most important person in your life,if you're lucky enough to know them.My mother was certainly the most important in mine.Let me try and describe her to you.She's 86 years old. She's frail.White, platinum hair.Why do they do that? Why do old ladies go to those hair shops,and make those helmets?(Laughter)Bright as a button. All the ducks in a row.Looks like a much prettier versionof Margaret Thatcher,(Laughter)but without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character.(Laughter)I wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs.But my mother has lived by this creedall her life."Never Go Back."Never go back. Never go back.Never return to the haunts of your youth.Keep to the track, to the beaten track;Memory holds all you need of the truth.Never look back. Never look back.Never succumb to the gorgon's stare.Keep to the track, to the beaten track;No-one is waiting and nothing is there.Never go back. Never go back.Never surrender the future you earned.Keep to the track, to the beaten track;Never return to the bridges you've burned.Never look back. Never look back.Never retreat to the 'glorious past.'Keep to the track, to the beaten track;Treat every day of your life as your last.Never go back. Never go back.Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair.Keep to the track, to the beaten track;No-one is waiting and nothing is there.(Applause)Now ladies and gentlemen, I'm up on me hobbyhorse.If every commercially minded cosmetic surgeonwere tied end to end along a railroad track,that would be me,stoking the trainwithout a qualm in the world.Ladies, don't do it.Don't do it.You think we want you to do it, but we don't want you to do it.Stop it.Tell them to go to hell.You bodies are wonderful as they are.Just leave them alone."To a Beautiful Lady of a Certain Age."Lady lady, do not weep.What is gone is gone. Now sleep.Turn your pillow. Dry your tears.Count thy sheep and not thy years.Nothing good can come of this.Time rules all, my dearest.'Tis but folly to be waging warOn one who never lost before.Lady, this is all in vain.Youth can never come again;We have drunk the summer wine.None can make a stitch in time.Nip and tuck till crack of doom.What is foretold in the wombMay not be foresworn with gold.Nor may time be bought or sold.Dearest, do I love thee less?Do I shrink from thy caress?Think you I could cease to care?Never was there one so fair!Lady lady, do not weep --What is gone is gone. Now sleep.Lean against me, calm your fears,Count thy blessings, not thy years.(Applause)America, ladies and gentlemen, has done more for me financially than Britainever has, or ever could have done.I was born in Britain, as you have probably guessed.Even when on its worst behavior,I find myself automatically defending the USAfrom the sneers of green-eyed Europhilesplaying their Greek card to Roman trumps.America is an empire.I hope you know that now.All empires, by definition, are bumbling,shambolic, bullying, bureaucratic affairs,as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy,as they are corrupted by power in their dotage.I am no historian, ladies and gentlemen.But it seems to be that the USA's sins,compared to those of many previous empires,are of a more moderate,if more pervasive, kind.Let me put this bluntly.If Americans are so fat,stupid and ignorant,my dear friends from Birmingham,how come they rule the world?"Hail to the Gods of America."Hail to the Gods of America!Hail to the gods of the dream.Invictus E Pluribus Unum.But which of them reigns supreme?Which is America's Jupiter?The Brahmins of Capital Hill?A sorcerer's profit on Wall Street?They eye of a dollar bill?Or is it celebrity status?The worship of those we hate.Or the cult of living forever,If only we'd watch our weight.What of the titans of media?Or Hollywood's siren call?What of the temples of justice,Whose servants enslave us all?What of the Brand and the Label?What of the upstart Sport?And what of the Constitution,That bully of last resort?Hail to the God of America,Whose power the masses extol --Convenience rules America;Convenience owns our soul.Aye, that it does.(Applause)And if you would like to know why I am not a father --I, who by a miracle have 22 godchildren --the answer is in this poem,which upsets me every time I read it."Love Came to Visit Me."Love came to visit me,shy as a fawn.But finding me busy,she fled, with the dawn.At 20 the torch of resentment was lit.My rage at injusticewaxed hot as the pits.The flux of its lava cleared all in its path.Comrades and enemies fled from its wrath.Yet lovers grew wary, once novelty wanedTo lie with a bloody man,his terror unfeigned.At 30 my powers seemed mighty to me.The fruits of my rivals, I shook from the tree.By guile and by bluster,by night and by day,I battered and scattered the fools from my way.And women grew willing to sham and to bluff.Their trinkets and baubles cost little enough.From 40 to 50, grown easy and sly,I wined them and dined them, like pigs in a sty.We feasted and reveled and rutted in muck,Forgetting our peril, forgetting to duck,Forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives.Grown sick to our stomachs,and sick of our lives.Love came to visit me,shy as a fawn.But finding me busy,she fled with the dawn.(Applause)Um, there are --I've got far too much money and I have far too much funin my businesses.So poetry came as a complete shock to me, ladies and gentlemen.A complete shock. I was a little ill.Okay, I was ill.Okay, I had a life-threatening illness, you know.I was in a clinic. I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls.I wasn't allowed to see any of my -- you know, whatever.So, in the end I begged a pack of Post-it notes off a nurse.And from another nurse, I begged a pencil, pen.And I didn't know what else to do. So I started to write poetry.That was in October of 2000.I'm not an evil man.But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position.I'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman,who men fall down, you know, when she walks in a room.But sometimes I try to put myself in that position.(Laughter)Not with much success.But it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse.I love to think what they thought, what it was like.Because althoughmany of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience,although you guys can not only go to the moon,you know, you're going to totally transform everything.Cloning will transform everything. Voice navigation will transform everything.I don't know. You can do anything you want.All you guys are so clever, and women, you can do it all!But human nature doesn't change, mate.My friends, human nature is exactly the same as it waswhen my ancestor --probably it was my ancestor --got his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal,and battered the bastard to death.You think we didn't do that?Oh, we did.We killed every single one of them.Inch by inch we killed them.We hunted them down wherever they were.Rivals for meat. Rivals for berries.We're still doing it,with all of the genius assembled in this room.Our natures haven't changed a single iota.And they never will.Even when we've got off this little planet,and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets.And I am as bad as you.I spent eight yearsrunning one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world.And at seven o'clock every night,I took me some more girls, already corrupted.I never did anything to anyone that wasn't.And I took crack cocaine,every single night for seven years.It was like Dante's "Inferno."It was unbelievable.One of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erectionfor about four hours.And you stay up for 12.It was absolutely unbelievable.Twenty-two godchildren I've got.What do I say to them?I only stopped because I thought if I got caught,what would happen to my mother.If you're a woman, remember that.The love of your soncan utterly transform anything he does."Our Lady in White."Pale she was, listless;And soft to the touch.A generous mistress Whom many loved much.Shoulder to shoulder, Night after night,We hoarded and sold her --Our Lady in White.We breathed but to savorher crystal caress.We craved but to favor the hem of her dress.We dabbled and babbled,Denying our thirsts.But always we scrabbledto lie with her first.Absent, we missed her,grew haggard and limp.Toyed with her sister,or threatened her pimp.Came word out of Babel, the lady returns!And there on the table we took her, in turns.Sensing the power that tyranny craves,There in that hour, she made us her slaves.Many there were, to covet her kiss.My shame as a spur,I fled the abyss.But only just.(Applause)

matthew_childs_9_rules_of_rock_climbing
698191

It's pretty simple. There are nine, sort of, rulesthat I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing.Most of them are pretty basic.Number one: don't let go --very sure success method.But really, truly -- often you think aboutletting go way before your body does.So hang in there,and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions.Number two: hesitation is bad.This is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows,in the Yosemite high country.Friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges.You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock.The most friction you have is when you first put your handor your foot on the rock.And then from that point on, you're basically falling.So momentum is good. Don't stop.Rule number three: have a plan.This is a climb called the Naked Edge,in El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder.This climber is on the last pitch of it.He's actually right about where I fell.There is about 1,000 feet of air below him.And all the hard pitches are actually below him.Often what happens isyou're planning so hard for like,"How do I get through the hardest part? How do I get through the hardest part?"And then what happens?You get to the last pitch. It's easy.And you're completely flamed out. Don't do it.You have to plan ahead to get to the top.But you also can't forget that each individual moveyou have to be able to complete.This is a climb called the Dike Route,on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard.But if you're the leader on it,at the hardest move, you're looking at about 100 foot fall,onto some low angle slabs.So you've got to focus.You don't want to stop in the middle likeColeridge's Kubla Kahn.You've got to keep going.Rule number five: know how to rest.It's amazing. The best climbersare the ones that in the most extreme situationscan get their bodies into some positionwhere they can rest,regroup, calm themselves, focus,and keep going.This is a climb in the Needles, again in California.Fear really sucks because what it means isyou're not focusing on what you're doing.You're focusing on the consequences offailing at what you're doingbecause any given move should requireall your concentration and thought processesto execute it effectively.One of the things in climbing is, most peoplesort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution.This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming,which is a columnar basalt formationthat most of you probably know from "Close Encounters."With this, typically crack climberswould put their hands in and their toes inand just start climbing.The cracks are too small to get your toes intoso the only way to climb is using your fingertipsin the cracks,and using opposing pressureand forcing yourself up.Rule number eight: strength doesn't always equal success.In the 35 years I've been a climbing guideand taught on indoor walls, and stuff like that,the most important thing I've learnedwas, guys will always try to do pull-ups.Beginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash,they get 15 feet up --and they can do about 15 pull-ups right --And then they just flame out.Women are much more in balancebecause they don't have that ideathat they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups.They think about how to get the weight over their feetbecause it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long.So balance is really critical,and keeping your weight on your feet,which is your strongest muscle.And of course there is rule number nine.I came up with rule number nine afterI actually didn't plan for a fall,and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib.Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen,you need to start thinking about how you're going to let gobecause that is the critical pieceof not getting hurt --how you're going to fall onto the rope,or if you're climbing without a rope,fall to a place where you can actually control the fall.So don't hang on till the bitter end.Thank you very much.(Applause)



emily_levine_s_theory_of_everything
1874492

I am going to talk about myself,which I rarely do, because I --well for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about.And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.(Laughter)I didn't know I was a narcissist actually.I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.And then someone told me there is a flip side to it.So it's actually drearier than self-love;it's unrequited self-love.(Laughter)I don't feel I can afford a relapse.But I want to, though, explainhow I came to design my own particular brand of comedybecause I've been through so many different forms of it.I started with improvisation,in a particular form of improvisation called theater games,which had one rule,which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society.And the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality,you could only build on it.And of course we live in a society that's all aboutcontradicting other peoples' reality.It's all about contradiction,which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general.I see it everywhere.Like polls. You know, it's always curious to methat in public opinion pollsthe percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given questionis always two percent.75 percent of Americansthink Alaska is part of Canada.But only two percent don't know the effectthat the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy --(Laughter)seems a contradiction.Or this ad that I read in the New York Times:"Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.Buying it from us screams good taste."(Laughter)Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer,in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron."Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts."(Laughter)"Don't use big words."(Laughter)"Learn the lingua franca."(Laughter)Yeah. "Lingua this, Frankie."(Laughter)And I suppose it's a contradiction that Italk about science when I don't know math.You know, because -- and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamenfor pointing out that one of the reasons,that there are cultural reasonsthat women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology --because for instance, the reason I don't do math is,I was taught to do math and read at the same time.So you're six years old, you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,and it becomes rapidly obviousthat there are only two kinds of men in the world:dwarves and Prince Charmings.And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince.(Laughter)That's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing.(Laughter)Of course, by talking about scienceI also may, as I did the other night,incur the violent wrath of some scientistswho were very upset with me.I used the word postmodern as if it were OK.And they got very upset.One of them, to his credit, I think really just wanted to engage mein a serious argument.But I don't engage in serious arguments.I don't approve of thembecause arguments, of course, are all about contradiction,and they're shaped by the values that I have questions with.I have questions with the values of Newtonian science,like rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument.Well rationality is constructedby what Christie Hefner was talking about today,that mind-body split, you know?The head is good, body bad.Head is ego, body id.When we say "I," -- as when Rene Descartes said,"I think therefore I am," --we mean the head.And as David Lee Roth sang in "Just a Gigolo,""I ain't got no body."That's how you get rationality.And that's why so much of humoris the body asserting itself against the head.That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor.That's why you have the Raspyni Brotherswhacking Richard in the genital area.And we're laughing doubly thenbecause he's the body, but it's also --Voice offstage: Richard.Emily Levine: Richard. What did I say?(Laughter)Richard. Yes but it's also the head,the head of the conference.That's the other way that humor --like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure --(Laughter)but nevertheless, what makes us treasure you and adore you.There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though,which is, as much as we revere the head,we are very anti-intellectual.I know this because I read in the New York Times,the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page adafter September 11,in which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran,the problem in this country, facing this countryis the university professors and their spawn."(Laughter)So I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."(Laughter)I don't know how many of you have read it.And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.(Laughter)But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217."The act of a mastertaking painful contemptuous possession of her,was the kind of rapture she wanted.When they lay together in bed it was,as it had to be, as the nature of the act demanded,an act of violence.It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable.Not a caress, but a wave of pain.The agony as an act of passion."So you can imagine my surpriseon reading in The New Yorkerthat Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve,claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor.(Laughter)It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.(Laughter)Bad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress.Now we have to picture Alan Greenspanin a black leather corset, with a butt tattoo that says,"Whip inflation now."(Laughter)And Ayn Rand of course, Ayn Randis famous for a philosophy called Objectivism,which reflects another value of Newtonian physics,which is objectivity.Objectivity basically is constructedin that same S&amp;M way.It's the subject subjugating the object.That's how you assert yourself.You make yourself the active voice.And the object is the passive no-voice.I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial.I don't know if you know this but --maybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement --but in many hospital nurseries across the country,until very recently anyway, according to a book by Jessica Benjamin,the signs over the little boys cribs read,"I'm a boy,"and the signs over the little girls cribs read,"It's a girl." Yeah.So the passivity was culturallyprojected onto the little girls.And this still goes on as I think I told you last year.There's a poll that proves --there was a poll that was given by Time magazine,in which only men were asked, "Have you ever had sexwith a woman you actively disliked?"And well, yeah.Well, 58 percent said yes,which I think is overinflated thoughbecause so many men if you just say,"Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!"They don't even wait for the rest of it.(Laughter)And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had --(Laughter)That's the first callback,of my attempted quadruple.(Laughter)So this subject-object thing,is part of something I'm very interested inbecause this is why, frankly, I believe in political correctness.I do. I think it can go too far.I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too farwith an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine."We have a lifelong emotional and financialcommitment to our Asian Elephant partners."(Laughter)Maybe too far. But you know --I don't think thata person of color making fun of white peopleis the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color.Or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women.Or poor people making fun of rich people, the same as rich people.I think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots,which is why you don't see me making fun ofKenneth Lay and his charming wife.(Laughter)What's funny about being down to four houses?(Laughter)And I really learned this lessonduring the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or,Or as I call them, the good ol' days.(Laughter)When people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal,and everything else,were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones.Basically, they were making fun of them for beingtrailer trash or white trash.It seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudiceand that you're not really hurting anybody.Until you read, as I did, an ad in the Los Angeles Times."For sale: White trash compactor."(Laughter)So this whole subject-object thinghas relevance to humor in this way.I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin,who is the chair of the Classics department at USC.And the book is called "The Garden of Priapus."And she says that Roman humormirrors the construction of Roman society.So that Roman society was very top/bottom,as ours is to some degree.And so was humor.There always had to be the butt of a joke.So it was always the satirist,like Juvenal or Martial,represented the audience,and he was going to make fun of the outsider,the person who didn't share that subject status.And in stand-up of course,the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience.A lot of heckling is the tensionof trying to make sure that thecomedian is going to be able to dominate,and overcome the heckler.And I got good at that when I was in stand up.But I always hated it because they weredictating the terms of the interaction,in the same way that engaging in a serious argumentdetermines the content, to some degree,of what you're talking about.And I was looking for a formthat didn't have that.And so I wanted something that was more interactive.I know that word is so debased nowby the use of it by Internet marketers.I really miss the old telemarketers now, I'll tell you that.(Laughter)I do, because at least there you stood a chance. You know?I used to actually hang up on them.But then I read in "Dear Abby" that that was rude.So the next time that one calledI let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said,"You sound sexy."(Laughter)He hung up on me!(Laughter)But the interactivity allows the audienceto shape what you're going to do as much asyou shape their experience of the world.And that's really what I'm looking for.And I was sort of, as I was starting to analyzewhat exactly it is that I do,I read a book called "Trickster Makes This World," by Lewis Hyde.And it was like being psychoanalyzed.I mean he had laid it all out.And then coming to this conference,I realized that most everybody hereshared those same qualitiesbecause really what trickster isis an agent of change.Trickster is a change agent.And the qualities that I'm about to describeare the qualities that make it possibleto make change happen.And one of these is boundary crossing.I think this is what so, in fact, infuriated the scientists.But I like to cross boundaries.I like to, as I said, talk about things I know nothing about.(Phone Ringing)I hope that's my agent,because you aren't paying me anything.(Laughter)And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing aboutbecause I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know?I'm able to see the contradictionthat you may not be able to see.Like for instance a mime once --or a meme as he called himself.He was a very selfish meme.And he said that I had to show more respectbecause it took up to 18 yearsto learn how to do mime properly.And I said, "Well, that's how you know only stupid people go into it."(Laughter)It only takes two years to learn how to talk.(Laughter)(Applause)And you know people, this is the problem withquote, objectivity, unquote.When you're only surrounded by peoplewho speak the same vocabulary as you,or share the same set of assumptions as you,you start to think that that's reality.Like economists, you know, their definition of rational,that we all act out of our own economic self-interest.Well, look at Michael Hawley,or look at Dean Kamen,or look at my grandmother.My grandmother always acted in other people's interests,whether they wanted her to or not.(Laughter)If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom,my grandmother would have lost on purpose.(Laughter)"No, you take the prize.You're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it?Where am I going? I'm going to die soon."(Laughter)So that's one -- this boundary crossing,this go-between which --Fritz Lanting, is that his name,actually said that he was a go-between.That's an actual quality of the trickster.And another is, non-oppositional strategies.And this is instead of contradiction.Where you deny the other person's reality,you have paradoxwhere you allow more than one reality to coexist,I think there's another philosophical construction.I'm not sure what it's called.But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store.It said, "Ears pierced while you wait."(Laughter)There the alternative just boggles the imagination.(Laughter)"Oh no. Thanks though, I'll leave them here. Thanks very much.I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them uparound five, if that's OK with you.Huh? Huh? What? Can't hear you."(Laughter)And another attribute of the tricksteris smart luck.That accidents, that Louis Kahn, who talked about accidents,this is another quality of the trickster.The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.That, and I will say this to the scientists,that the trickster has the ability to holdhis ideas lightlyso that he can let room in for new ideasor to see the contradictions or the hidden problemswith his ideas.I had no joke for that.I just wanted to put the scientists in their place.(Laughter)But here's how I think I like to make change,and that is in making connections.This is what I tend to seealmost more than contradictions.Like the, what do you call those toes of the gecko?You know, the toes of the gecko,curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen.I love connections.Like I'll read that one of the two attributesof matter in the Newtonian universe --there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe --one is space occupancy. Matter takes up space.I guess the more you matter the more space you take up,which explains the whole SUV phenomenon.(Laughter)And the other one though is impenetrability.Well, in ancient Rome, impenetrabilitywas the criterion of masculinity.Masculinity depended on youbeing the active penetrator.And then, in economics, there's an active producerand a passive consumer,which explains why business always has topenetrate new markets.Well yeah, I mean why we forced Chinato open her markets.And didn't that feel good?(Laughter)And now we're being penetrated.You know the biotech companies are actually going inside usand planting their little flags on our genes.You know we're being penetrated.And I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.(Laughter)That's the second of the quadruple.Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much.I still have a way to go.(Laughter)And what I hope to do, when I make these connections,is short circuit people's thinking.You know, make you not follow your usualtrain of association,but make you rewire.It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition,it's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think --I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.I'm so sorry. I'm getting likethe woman in that joke about --have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother?And the mother is elderly.And the mother goes right through a red light.And the daughter doesn't want to say anything.She doesn't want to be like, "You're too old to drive."And the mother goes through a second red light.And the daughter says, as tactfully as possible,"Mom, are you aware that you just went through two red lights?"And the mother says, "Oh! Am I driving?"(Laughter)And that's the shock of recognitionat the shock of recognition.That completes the quadruple.(Laughter)I just want to say two more things.One is, another characteristic of tricksteris that the trickster has towalk this fine line.He has to have poise.And you know the biggest hurdle for me,in doing what I do,is constructing my performanceso that it's prepared and unprepared.Finding the balance between those thingsis always dangerousbecause you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.But being too prepared doesn't leave roomfor the accidents to happen.I was thinking about what Moshe Safdiesaid yesterday about beautybecause in his book, Hyde says thatsometimes trickster can tip over into beauty.But to do that you have tolose all the other qualitiesbecause once you're into beautyyou're into a finished thing.You're into something thatoccupies space and inhabits time.It's an actual thing.And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty.But if you don't do that,if you allow for the accident to keep on happening,you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength.I like to think of what I do as a probability wave.When you go into beauty the probability wavecollapses into one possibility.And I like to explore all the possibilitiesin the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience.And the one final quality I want to say about trickster isthat he doesn't have a home.He's always on the road.I want to say to you Richard, in closing,that in TED you've created a home.And thank you for inviting me into it.Thank you very much.(Applause)

One thing I wanted to say about film making is -- about this film --in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here,Michael Moschen, and some of the talks about music,this idea that there is a narrative line,and that music exists in time.A film also exists in time; it's an experiencethat you should go through emotionally.And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seenwere all about learning something,or knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas.And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions,and really to follow my journey.So instead of doing the talking head thing, instead it's composed of scenes,and we meet people along the way.We only meet them once.They don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey.It's something like life, that once you get in ityou can't get out.There are two clips I want to show you,the first one is a kind of hodgepodge,its just three little moments, four little momentswith three of the people who are here tonight.It's not the way they occur in the film,because they are part of much larger scenes.They play off each other in a wonderful way.And that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou,talking about something that is very dear to him,which is the accidents of life.I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental,and perhaps not planned at all.And those three clips will be followed by a scene ofperhaps what, to me, is really his greatest buildingwhich is a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh.He built the capital over there.And I think you'll enjoy this building, it's never been seen --it's been still photographed, but never photographed by a film crew.We were the first film crew in there.So you'll see images of this remarkable building.A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it,it was built entirely by hand,I think they got a crane the last year.It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding,people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads,dumping them in the forms.It is the capital of the country,and it took 23 years to build,which is something they seem to be very proud of over there.It took as long as the Taj Mahal.Unfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished.He died in 1974.The building was finished in 1983.So it continued on for many yearsafter he died.Think about that when you see that building,that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished.And that really struck me about my father,in the sense that he had such beliefthat somehow, doing these thingsgiving in the way that he gave, that something good would come out of it,even in the middle of a war, there was a war with Pakistan at one point,and the construction stopped totally and he kept working,because he felt, "Well when the war is donethey'll need this building."So, those are the two clips I'm going to show.Roll that tape.(Applause)Richard Saul Wurman: I remember hearing him talk at Penn.And I came home and I said to my father and mother,"I just met this man: doesn't have much work,and he's sort of ugly, funny voice,and he's a teacher at school.I know you've never heard of him, but just mark this daythat someday you will hear of him,because he's really an amazing man."Frank Gehry: I heard he had some kind of a fling with Ingrid Bergman. Is that true?Nathaniel Kahn: If he did he was a very lucky man.(Laughter)NK: Did you hear that, really?FG: Yeah, when he was in Rome.Moshe Safdie: He was a real nomad.And you know, when I knew him when I was in the office,he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the officefor two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go.You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with usand there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him.I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station,it was so consistent with his life, you know?I mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane,or I'm going to die in an airport,or die jogging without an identification on me.I don't know why I sort of carry thatfrom that memory of the way he died.But he was a sort of a nomad at heart.Louis Kahn: How accidental our existences are reallyand how full of influence by circumstance.Man: We are the morning workers who come, all the time, hereand enjoy the walking, city's beauty and the atmosphereand this is the nicest place of Bangladesh.We are proud of it.NK: You're proud of it?Man: Yes, it is the national image of Bangladesh.NK: Do you know anything about the architect?Man: Architect? I've heard about him; he's a top-ranking architect.NK: Well actually I'm here because I'm the architect's son,he was my father.Man: Oh! Dad is Louis Farrakhan?NK: Yeah. No not Louis Farrakhan, Louis Kahn.Man: Louis Kahn, yes!(Laughter)Man: Your father, is he alive?NK: No, he's been dead for 25 years.Man: Very pleased to welcome you back.NK: Thank you.NK: He never saw it finished, Pop.No, he never saw this.Shamsul Wares: It was almost impossible, building for a country like ours.In 30, 50 years back, it was nothing, only paddy fields,and since we invited him here,he felt that he has got a responsibility.He wanted to be a Moses here, he gave us democracy.He is not a political man,but in this guise he has given usthe institution for democracy, from where we can rise.In that way it is so relevant.He didn't care for how much money this country has,or whether he would be able to ever finish this building,but somehow he has been able to do it, build it, here.And this is the largest project he has got in here, the poorest country in the world.NK: It cost him his life.SW: Yeah, he paid. He paid his life for this,and that is why he is great and we'll remember him.But he was also human.Now his failure to satisfy the family life,is an inevitable association of great people.But I think his son will understand this,and will have no sense of grudge,or sense of being neglected, I think.He cared in a very different manner,but it takes a lot of time to understand that.In social aspect of his lifehe was just like a child, he was not at all matured.He could not say no to anything,and that is why, that he cannot say no to things,we got this building today.You see, only that way you can be able to understand him.There is no other shortcut,no other way to really understand him.But I think he has given us this buildingand we feel all the time for him,that's why, he has given love for us.He could not probably give the right kind of love for you,but for us, he has given the people the right kind of love,that is important.You have to understand that.He had an enormous amount of love,he loved everybody.To love everybody, he sometimes did not seethe very closest ones,and that is inevitable for men of his stature.(Applause)



ueli_gegenschatz_extreme_wingsuit_jumping
1384612

I started with paragliding.Paragliding is taking off from mountainswith a paraglider, with the possibility tofly cross-country, distance,just with the use of thermals to soar.Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possiblewith a paraglider.From there I started with skydiving.In this picture you can seethere is a four-way skydive,four people flying together,and on the left hand side it's the camera flierwith the camera mounted to his helmetso he can film the whole jump,for the film itself and also for the judging.From regular, relative skydivingI went on to freeflying.Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving.You can see the skydiver with the red suit,he's in a stand-up position.The one with the yellow-green suit,he's flying head-down.And that's me in the background, carving around the whole formationin freefall also, with the helmet camto film this jump.From freeflying I went on to skysurfing.Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.You can imagine with this big surfaceof a skysurfing board,there is a lot of force, a lot of power.Of course I can use this powerfor example for nice spinning -- we call it "helicopter moves."From there I went on to wingsuit flying.Wingsuit flying is a suit,that I can make fly, just only with my body.If I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit,I can make it fly. And as you seethe fall rate is much much slowerbecause of the bigger surface.With a proper body position I'm able to really move forwardto gain quite some distance.This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro.You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side.From there with all the skills and knowledgefrom paragliding and all the different disciplinesin skydiving, I went on to BASE jumping.BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects,like buildings, antennae, bridges and earth --meaning mountains, cliffs.It's for sure -- for me -- it's the ultimate feelingof being in free fall,with all the visual references.So my goal soon was to discover new placesthat nobody had jumped before.So in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jumpthe Eiger North Face in Switzerland.Two years after this, I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn,a very famous mountain that probablyeverybody knows in here.2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau,three very famous mountains in Switzerland.The special thing on these three jumps were,I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day.In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris.(Laughter)So with all this knowledge, I alsowanted to get into stunts.So with some friends we started to do different tricks,like for example this jump here,I jumped from a paraglider.Or here -- everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me,because it was very cold in Austriawhere we did this filming.Everybody sitting in a basket,and I was on top of the balloon,ready to slide down with my skysurf board.Or this jump, from a moving truck on the highway.(Laughter)Extreme sports on top level like thisis only possible if you practice step by step,if you really work hard on your skillsand on your knowledge.Of course you need to be in physical, very good, condition,so I'm training a lot.You need to have the best possible equipment.And probably the most important isyou have to work on your mental skills, mental preparation.And all this to come as close as possibleto the human dream of being able to fly.So for 2009,I'm training hard for my two new projects.The first one, I want to set a world recordin flying from a cliff with my wingsuit.And I want to set a new record,with the longest distance ever flown.For my second project,I have a sensational ideaof a jump that never has been done before.So now, on the following movie you will seethat I'm much better in flying a wingsuitthan speaking in English.Enjoy, and thank you very much.(Applause)(Applause)June Cohen: I have some questions.I think we all might have some questions.Question one: so does that actually feelthe way the flying dream does?Because it looks like it might.Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closestpossibility to come to the dream of being able to fly.JC: I know the answer to this, but how do you land?UE: Parachute. We have to open a parachutejust seconds before, I would say, impact.(Laughter)It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet.JC: Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those --you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it?UE: It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah.We're still working on it and we'redeveloping the wingsuits to get better performance,to get more knowledge.And I believe soon.JC: All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions.What is the -- there was exhaust comingout of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing?UE: Nope. It's just smoke.JC: Coming off of you?(Laughter)UE: Hopefully not.(Laughter)JC: That seems dangerous.UE: No, smoke is for two reasons,you can see the speed, you can see the waywhere I was flying.That's reason number one. And reason number two:it's much easier for the camera guy to filmIf I'm using smoke.JC: Ah, I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smokeso that you can be tracked. One more question.What do you do to to cover your face?Because I just keep thinking of going that fastand having your whole face smushed backwards.Are you in a helmet? Are you in goggles?UE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles.JC: And is that how you usually fly?UE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmetbecause of landings -- usually it's difficult --it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.So you have to be prepared.JC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do?Do people come to you with projects and say, "We want you to do this!"and do you ever say, "No, no I'm not going to."UE: Oh of course, of course. Some people have crazy ideas and --(Laughter)JC: ...a round of applause...(Applause)UE: Thank you very much.(Applause)



c_k_williams_reads_poetry_of_youth_and_age
231491

I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subjectof youth and age.I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually.The first one is dedicated toSpencer, and his grandmother, who was shocked by his work.My poem is called "Dirt."My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap;half a long century goneand still she comes at mewith that thick cruel yellow bar.All because of a word I said,not even said really, only repeated.But "Open," she says, "open up!"her hand clawing at my head.I know now her life was hard;she lost three children as babies,then her husband died too,leaving young sons, and no money.She'd stand me in the sink to peebecause there was never room in the toilet.But oh, her soap!Might its bitter burning have beenwhat made me a poet?The street she lived on was unpaved,her flat, two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchenwhere she stalked and caught me.Dare I admit that after she did itI never really loved her again?She lived to a hundred,even then. All along it was the sadness, the squalor,but I never, until nowloved her again.When that was published in a magazineI got an irate letter from my uncle."You have maligned a great woman."It took some diplomacy.This is called "The Dress."It's a longer poem.In those days,those days which exist for me onlyas the most elusive memory now,when often the first sound you'd hear in the morningwould be a storm of birdsong,then the soft clop of the hoovesof the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block,and the last sound at night as likely as notwould be your father pulling up in his car,having worked late again, always late,and going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace,to shake out the ashes and damp the draftbefore he came upstairs to fall into bed --in those long-ago days,women, my mother, my friends' mothers,our neighbors, all the women I knew --wore, often much of the day,what were called housedresses,cheap, printed, pulpy,seemingly purposefully shapelesslight cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgownand, when you had to go look for a child,hang wash on the line,or run down to the grocery store on the corner,under a coat,the twisted hem of the nightgownalways lank and yellowed,dangling beneath.More than the curlers some of the womenseemed constantly to have in their hairin preparation for some great event --a ball, one would think --that never came to pass;more than the way most women's facesnot only were never made up during the day,but seemed scraped, bleached,and, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike;more than all that it was those dressesthat made women so unknowable and forbidding,adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access,and boys no conception.Only later would I see the dresses alsoas a proclamation:that in your dim kitchen, your laundry,your bleak concrete yard,what you revealed of yourselfwas a fabulation;your real sensual nature,veiled in those sexless vestments,was utterly your dominion.In those days, one hid much else as well:grown men didn't embrace one another,unless someone had died,and not always then; you shook handsor, at a ball game, thumped your friend's backand exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection;once out of childhood you'd never again knowthe shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek,not until mores at last had evolved,and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment,then even kiss (your fathers bristleswhite and stiff now).What release finally, the embrace:though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious --how much unspoken joy there wasin that affirmation of equality and communion,no matter how much misunderstandingand pain had passed between you by then.We knew so little in those days,as little as now, I supposeabout healing those hurts:even the women, in their best dresses,with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices,even in lipstick and mascara,their hair aflow,could only stand wringing their hands,begging for peace,while father and son, like thugs,like thieves, like Romans,simmered and hissed and hated,inflicting sorrows that endured,the worst anyway,through the kiss and embrace,bleeding from brother to brother,into the generations.In those days there was still countrysideclose to the city, farms, cornfields, cows;even not far from our buildingwith its blurred brick and long shadowy hallwayyou could find tracts with hills and treesyou could pretend were mountains and forests.Or you could go out by yourselfeven to a half-block-long empty lot,into the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk,crouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone;already there was wanting to be simpler,wanting, when they called you,never to go back.(Applause)This is another longish one,about the old and the young.It actually happened right at the time we met.Part of the poem takes place inspace we shared and time we shared.It's called "The Neighbor."Her five horrid, deformed little dogswho incessantly yap on the roof under my window.Her cats, God knows how many,who must piss on her rugs --her landing's a sickening reek.Her shadow once, fumbling the chain on her door,then the door slamming fearfully shut,only the barking and the music -- jazz --filtering as it does, day and night into the hall.The time it was Chris Connor singing "Lush Life" --how it brought back my college sweetheart,my first real love, who -- till I left her --played the same record.And head on my shoulder, hand on my thigh,sang sweetly along, of regrets and depletionsshe was too young for,as I was too young, later, to believe in her pain.It startled, then bored, then repelled me.My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trapin the Village, that my neighbor was her.My thinking we'd meet, recognize one another,become friends, that I'd accomplish a penance.My seeing her, it wasn't her, at the mailbox.Gray-yellow hair, army pants under a nightgown,her turning away, hiding her ravaged facein her hands, muttering an inappropriate "Hi."Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell.A man shouting, "Shut up!" The dogs frantically snarling,claws scrabbling, then her -- her voicehoarse, harsh, hollow,almost only a tone,incoherent, a note, a squawk,bone on metal, metal gone molten,calling them back,"Come back darlings, come back dear ones.My sweet angels, come back."Medea she was, next time I saw her.Sorceress, tranced, ecstatic,stock-still on the sidewalkragged coat hanging agape,passersby flowing around her,her mouth torn suddenly openas though in a scream,silently though, as though only in her brainor breast had it erupted.A cry so pure, practiced, detached,it had no need of a voice,or could no longer bear one.These invisible links that allure,these transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us.The girl, my old love,the last lost time I saw herwhen she came to find me at a party,her drunkenly stumbling, falling,sprawling, skirt hiked, eyes veined red,swollen with tears, her shame,her dishonor.My ignorant, arrogant coarseness,my secret pride, my turning away.Still life on a rooftop,dead trees in barrels, a bench broken,dogs, excrement, sky.What pathways through pain,what junctures of vulnerability,what crossings and counterings?Too many lives in our lives already,too many chances for sorrow,too many unaccounted-for pasts."Behold me," the god of frenzied,inexhaustible love says,rising in bloody splendor, "Behold me."Her making her waydown the littered vestibule stairs,one agonized step at a time.My holding the door.Her crossing the fragmented tiles,faltering at the step to the street,droning, not looking at me,"Can you help me?"Taking my arm, leaning lightly against me.Her wavering step into the world.Her whispering, "Thanks love." Lightly, lightly against me.(Applause)I think I'll lighten up a little.(Laughter)Another, different kind of poem of youth and age.It's called "Gas."(Laughter)Wouldn't it be nice, I think,when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting roombends over the magazine tableand farts, just a little,and violently blushes.Wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gascame embodied in visible clouds,so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pophad only barely grazed my facebefore it drifted away.(Laughter)Besides, for this to have happened nowis a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago,while we were on our walk,my dog was startled by a backfireand jumped straight up like a horse bucking.And that brought back to me the stableI worked on weekends when I was 12,and a splendid piebald stallion,who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that,though more hugely of course,enormous, gleaming, resplendent.And the woman, her face abashedly buriedin her "Elle" now, reminded me --I'd forgotten that not the least part of my aweconsisted of the fact that with every jump he tookthe horse would powerfully fart.Phwap! Phwap! Phwap!Something never mentionedin the dozens of books about horsesand their riders I devoured in those days.All that savage grandeur,the steely glinting hooves,the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards,breath stopped, heart stopped, nostrils madly flared,I didn't know if I wanted to break him, or be him.(Laughter)(Applause)This is called "Thirst."Many -- most of my poems actuallyare urban poems. I happen to be reading a bunch that aren't."Thirst."Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter,day and night, on a benchin the 103rd Street subway station,until finally one day she vanished.We regarded each other, scrutinized one another.Me shyly, obliquely, trying not to be furtive.She boldly, unblinkingly, even pugnaciously,wrathfully even, when her bottle was empty.I was frightened of her. I felt like a child.I was afraid some repressed part of myselfwould go out of control, and I'd be forever entrappedin the shocking seethe of her stench.Not excrement merely, not merely surfaceand orifice going unwashed,rediffusion of rum,there was will in it,and intention, power and purpose --a social, ethical rage and rebellion --despair too, though, grief, loss.Sometimes I'd think I should take her home with me,bathe her, comfort her, dress her.She wouldn't have wanted me to, I would think.Instead, I'd step into my train.How rich I would think, is the lexiconof our self-absolving.How enduring, our bland fatal assurancethat reflection is righteousness being accomplished.The dance of our glances,the clash, pulling each other throughour perceptual punctures,then holocaust, holocaust,host on host of ill, injured presences,squandered, consumed.Her vigil somewhere I know continues.Her occupancy, her absolute, faithful attendance.The dance of our glances, challenge, abdication,effacement, the perfume of our consternation.(Applause)This is a newer poem, a brand new poem.The title is "This Happened."A student, a young womanin a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee,perched on the ledge of an open windowchatting with friends between classes;a teacher passes and chides her,"Be careful, you might fall,"almost banteringly chides her,"You might fall,"and the young woman, 18, a girl really,though she wouldn't think that,as brilliant as she is, first in her class,and "Beautiful, too," she's often told,smiles back, and leans into the open window,which wouldn't even be open if it were winter --if it were winter someone would have closed it ("Close it!") --leans into the window, farther, still smiling,farther and farther, though it takes less timethan this, really an instant, and lets herself fall.Herself fall.A casual impulse, a fancy,never thought of until now, hardly thought of even now ...No, more than impulse or fancy,the girl knows what she's doing,the girl means something,the girl means to mean,because it occurs to her in that instant,that beautiful or not, bright yes or no,she's not who she is,she's not the person she is,and the reason, she suddenly knows,is that there's been so much premeditationwhere she is, so much plotting and planning,there's hardly a person where she is,or if there is, it's not her, or not wholly her,it's a self inhabited, lived in by her,and seemingly even as she thinks itshe knows what's been missing:grace,not premeditation but grace,a kind of being in the world spontaneously,with grace.Weightfully upon me was the world.Weightfully this self which graced the worldyet never wholly itself.Weightfully this self which weighed upon me,the release from which is what I desireand what I achieve.And the girl remembers, in this infinite instantalready now so many times divided,the sadness she felt once,hardly knowing she felt it,to merely inhabit herself.Yes, the girl falls, absurd to fall,even the earth with its compulsionto take unto itself all that fallsmust know that falling is absurd,yet the girl falling isn't myself,or she is myself,but a self I took of my own volition unto myself.Forever. With grace.This happened.(Applause)I'll read just one more. I don't usually say that.I like to just end.But I'm afraid that Ricky will come out hereand shake his fist at me.This is called "Old Man," appropriately enough."Special: big tits,"Says the advertisement for a soft-core magazineon our neighborhood newsstand.But forget her breasts.A lush, fresh-lipped blond,skin glowing gold, sprawls there,resplendent.60 nearly, yet these hardly tangible,hardly better than harlots, can still stir me.Maybe a coming of age in theAmerican sensual darkness,never seeing an unsmudged nipple,an uncensored vagina,has left me forever infectedwith an unquenchable lust of the eye.Always that erotic murmur,I'm hardly myselfif I'm not in a state of incipient desire.God knows though,there are worse twists your obsessions can take.Last year in Israel, a young ultra-orthodox Rabbiguiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoahforbade them to look in one room.Because there were images in it he said were licentious.The display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked,some trying to cover their genitals,others too frightened to bother,lined up in snowwaiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch.The girls, to my horror,averted their gaze.What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them.Even that though. Another confession:Once in a book on pre-war Poland,a studio portrait, an absolute angel,an absolute angel with tormented, tormenting eyes.I kept finding myself at her page.That she died in the camps made her --I didn't dare wonder why --more present, more precious.Died in the camps, that too people --or Jews anyway --kept from their children back then.But it was like sex, you didn't have to be told.Sex and death, how close they can seem.So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me,sometimes I think I confound them.My wife's loveliness almost consumes me.My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds.When we make love, her holding meeverywhere all around me,I'm there and not there.My mind teems, jumbles of faces, voices, impressions,I live my life over, as though I were drowning.Then I am drowning, in despairat having to leave her,this, everything, all,unbearable, awful.Still, to be able to diewith no special contrition,not having been slaughtered, or enslaved.And not having to know history's nextmad rage or regression,it might be a relief.No. Again, no.I don't mean that for a moment.What I mean is the world holds me so tightly --the good and the bad --my own follies and weaknessthat even this counterfeit Venuswith her sham heat, and her bosom probably plumpedwith gel, so moves memy breath catches.Vamp. Siren. Seductress.How much more she revealsin her glare of ink than she knows.How she incarnatesour desperate human need for regard,our passion to live in beauty,to be beauty, to be cherished by glances,if by no more, of something like love,or love.Thank you.(Applause)

I don't know what the hell I'm doing here.I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada,and dropped out of high school. I don't own a cell phone,and I paint on paper using gouache, which hasn't changed in 600 years.But about three years ago I had an art show in New York,and I titled it "Serious Nonsense."So I think I'm actually the first one here -- I lead.I called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side,I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustrationfrom when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it --it's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal.And meanwhile, I use nonsense, as you can see.This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors,and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor --which you can't see there.This was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book.This is a home-built rocket-propelled car. That's a 1953 Henry J --I'm a bug for authenticity -- in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo.This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film.You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town.My work is so personal and so strangethat I have to invent my own lexicon for it.And I work a lot in what I call "retrofuturism,"which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow.And they're always wrong, always hilariously, optimistically wrong.And the peak time for that was the 30s,because the Depression was so dismalthat anything to get away from the present into the future ...and technology was going to carry us along.This is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days --I had a huge collection of them from the '30s --all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglassesout of wire coat hangers and everything improvisedand dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robotsplaying ice hockey at 300 miles an hour --it's all going to happen, it's all going to be wonderful.Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties.I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter,so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject.Detroit has always been halfway into the future -- the advertising half.This is the '58 Bulgemobile: so new, they make tomorrow look like yesterday.This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car.That's from a whole catalog -- it's 18 pages or so --ran back in the days of the Lampoon, where I cut my teeth.Techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened --for good reason, usually.The zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelinbased, obviously, on the Hindenburg.But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man.And it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark,and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it.So the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go.This is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s.The auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter,but it should have -- it wasn't a big success.It's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way.You needed to know that.The flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post-war dream.My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car.This is pitched into the future from 1946,looking at the day all American families have them."There's Moscow, Shirley. Hope they speak Esperanto!"Faux-nostalgia, which I'm sort of -- not, say, famous for, but I work an awful lot in it.It's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened.Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion --so I think that’s a case for serious play.This is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining,recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s,dining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here,but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novelto Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away.This is tank polo in the South Hamptons.The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that.And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense.I think it adds a huge amount.Those, for example, are Mark IV British tanks from 1916.They had two machine guns and a cannon,and they had 90 horsepower Ricardo engines.They went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark.And they had a canary hung inside the thingto make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas.Happy little story, isn't it?This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30s,where you drove up to your front door, if you had the guts.Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there.I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm.And I love cigars -- there's a cigar billboard down there.And faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war.This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940,when a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commonsand buzzes around, just to piss off Churchill, who's down there somewhere.It's a fond memory of times past.Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit,just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did -- a brochure again --"RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World."The copy, which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages,says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over,and it's so safe it carries no insurance.It's obviously modeled on the Titanic.But it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements.It's just a sick, silly joke.Shamelessly cheap is something, I think -- this will wake you up.It has no meaning, just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi,and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi.I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back pagefor an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that,and I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it."People wrote in for reprints of that thing.Urban absurdism -- that's what the New Yorker really calls for.I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.I've done about 40 of them, and I'd say 30 of them are based on that concept.I was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m.,and this steam pouring out of the street, and I thought, "What causes that?" And that --who’s to say?The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York -- it's a very somber place.I thought I could jazz it up a bit, have a little fun with it.This is a very un-PC cover. Not in New York.I couldn't resist, and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying,"This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed,please apologize on our website."Haven't got around to it yet but -- I may.This is the word side of my brain.(Laughter)I love the word "Eurotrash."(Laughter)That's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs.This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France.If you live in New York, you know how the bike messengers move.Except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do --and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terroristabout to shoot rockets at the Tour de France --sign of our times, I guess.This is the only fashion cover I've ever done.It's the little old lady that lives in a shoe, and then this thing --the title of that was, "There Goes the Neighborhood."I don't know a hell of a lot about fashion --I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane,and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying:"Put a strap on it" -- "No, don't put a strap on it" -- "Put a strap on it -- "Don't put a strap on it" --because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it's bad and --I finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe.This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea.This is a big joke.This is the audition for "King Kong."(Laughter)People always ask me, where do you get your ideas, how do your ideas come?Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover,in the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down.It was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it.And then when it ran, a lovely lady, an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg --if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover, it was so sweet.Her former name was Fay Wray, and so that was --I didn't have the wit to say, "Take the painting."Finally, this was a three-page cover, never done before,and I don't think it will ever be done again --successive pages in the front of the magazine.It's the ascent of man using an escalator, and it's in three parts.You can't see it all together, unfortunately, but if you look at it enough,you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move.(Applause)Pretty elegant. Nothing like a crash to end a joke. That completes my oeuvre.I would just like to add a crass commercial --I have a kids' book coming out in the fall called "Marvel Sandwiches,"a compendium of all the serious play that ever was,and it’s going to be available in fine bookstores, crummy bookstores,tables on the street in October.So thank you very much.

About four years ago, the New Yorker published an articleabout a cache of dodo bones that was foundin a pit on the island of Mauritius.Now, the island of Mauritius is a small islandoff the east coast of Madagascarin the Indian Ocean, and it is the placewhere the dodo bird was discoveredand extinguished, all within about 150 years.Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find,because it meant that they might finally be ableto assemble a single dodo skeleton.See, while museums all over the worldhave dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody --not even the actual Natural History Museumon the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that's madefrom the bones of a single dodo.Well, this isn't exactly true.The fact is, is that the British Museumhad a complete specimen of a dodo in their collectionup until the 18th century --it was actually mummified, skin and all --but in a fit of space-saving zeal,they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feetand they burned the rest in a bonfire.If you go look at their website today,they'll actually list these specimens, saying,the rest was lost in a fire.Not quite the whole truth. Anyway.The frontispiece of this article was this photo,and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brownwas great for bringing photos to the New Yorker,because this photo completely rocked my world.I became obsessed with the object --not just the beautiful photograph itself,and the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that's visible,the wire you can see on the beak therethat the conservator used to put this skeleton together --there's an entire story here.And I thought to myself,wouldn't it be greatif I had my own dodo skeleton?(Laughter)I want to point out here at this point thatI've spent my life obsessedby objects and the stories that they tell,and this was the very latest one.So I began looking around for --to see if anyone sold a kit,some kind of model that I could get,and I found lots of reference material, lots of lovely pictures.No dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletonsinto my "Creative Projects" folder --it's a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.Any time I have an internet connection,there's a sluice of stuff moving into there,everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washingtonto celebrate the storming of the Bastille.Russian nuclear launch key:The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay;the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself,because I couldn't afford the one on eBay.Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth --that's one I hand-drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder.This folder has 17,000 photos --over 20 gigabytes of information --and it's growing constantly.And one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have beenmaybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids,and I was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day.I bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.And I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought,maybe,yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull.I should point out at this time -- I'm not a sculptor;I'm a hard-edged model maker.You give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate,you give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from "Star Wars" --especially parts from "Star Wars" --I can do this stuff all day long.It's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.But you give me something like this --my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this;it's a maquette for "Star Wars, Episode Two" --this is not my thing --this is something other people do -- dragons, soft things.However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skullsto actually be able tounderstand the topology and perhaps replicate it --I mean, it couldn't be that difficult.So, I started looking at the best photos I could find.I grabbed all the reference,and I found this lovely piece of reference.This is someone selling this on eBay;it was clearly a woman’s hand, hopefully a woman's hand.Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand,I made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that,along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to itas size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be,exactly how long, etc.And over a few hours, I eventually achievedwhat was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I --it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy roomby picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton;I just noticed that as I finished this skull,the armature wire that I had been used to holding it upwas sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the yearsis spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.I actually understood the mechanicsof vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them.And so button by button,vertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.And actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull,a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.And again, I kept on going, looking for more reference,every bit of reference I could find -- drawings, beautiful photos.This guy -- I love this guy! He put a dodo leg bones on a scannerwith a ruler.This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted,and Ireplicated every last bone and put it in.And after about six weeks,I finished, painted, mountedmy own dodo skeleton.You can see that I even made a museum label for itthat includes a brief history of the dodo.And TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn't photograph it --a museum vitrine.I don't have the room for this in my house,but I had to finish what I had started.And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.Again, like I said, my life has been aboutbeing fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell,and also making them for myself, obtaining them,appreciating them and diving into them.And in this folder, "Creative Projects,"there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on,projects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day,and things that I may just want to find and buy and haveand look at and touch.But now there was potentially this new category of thingsthat I could sculptthat was different, that I -- you know,I have my own R2D2, but that's --honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy.And so I went back and looked through my "Creative Projects" folder,and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.Now, this is funny for me:to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel,because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people,Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.But in this case,it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story,it's about the object in and of itself.And in this case, this object is --plays on a host of levels.First of all, there's the object in the world.This is the "Kniphausen Hawk."It is a ceremonial pouring vesselmade around 1700 for a Swedish Count,and it is very likely the object from whichHammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.Built out of words, it is the enginethat drives the plot of his book and also the movie,in which another object is created:a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words,inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.And then there is this fourth level, which isa whole new object in the world:the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing,becomes, in its own right,a whole other thing,a whole new object of desire.And so now it was time to do some research.I actually had done some researcha few years before -- it's why the folder was there.I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica,of the Maltese Falcon on eBay,and had downloaded enough pictures to actuallyhave some reasonable reference.But I discovered,in researching further,really wanting precise reference, thatone of the original lead birdshad been sold at Christie's in 1994,and so I contacted an antiquarian booksellerwho had the original Christie's catalogue,and in it I found this magnificent picture,which included a size reference.I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan,a New Jersey editor, actually found thisresin Maltese Falconat a flea market in 1991,although it took him five yearsto authenticate this bird tothe auctioneers' specifications,because there was a lot of controversy about it.It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie propsabout the time the movie was made.It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it,because I can see it compared to this thing,and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing,it's made from the exact same mold that this one is.In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial,Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this --I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars --they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom --not just a front elevation, but alsoa side, rearand other side elevation.So now, I had all the topology I neededto replicate the Maltese Falcon.What do they do, how do you start something like that? I really don't know.So what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull,I blew all my reference up to full size,and then I began cutting out the negatives and usingthose templates as shape references.So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it,and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail,I worked out and achieved --working in front of the television and Super Sculpey --here's me sitting next to my wife --it's the only picture I took of the entire process.As I moved through, I achieveda very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.But again, I am not a sculptor,and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like,I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey;I certainly wasn't able to get it.So, I went down to my shop,and I molded it and I cast it in resin,because in the resin, then, I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.My preference is about 70 coats of this --matte black auto primer.I spray it on for about three or four days, it drips to hell,but it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surfaceand I can get it glass-smooth.Oh, finishing up with triple-zero steel wool.Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was thatbecause in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end,and they place it on the table, they actually spin it.So I was able to actuallyscreen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the lightin the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it --that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.And it's beautiful. And I can state with authorityat this point in time, when I'd finished it,of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few --this is by far the most accuraterepresentation of the original Maltese Falconthan anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you,is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.This is where it gets weird.Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy, George Hodel.Terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killerof the Black Dahlia.Now, James Ellroy believesthat Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon,killed James Elroy's mother.I'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974,during the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon,"called "The Black Bird," starring George Segal,the Los Angeles County Museum of Arthad a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon --one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie --stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thoughtit was a publicity stunt for the movie.John's Grill, which actuallyis seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon,"is still a viable San Francisco eatery,counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook,who played Wilmer Cook in the movie,and he gave themone of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years,until it got stolenin January of 2007.It would seem that the object of desireonly comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly.So here I had this Falcon,and it was lovely. It looked really great,the light worked on it really well,it was better than anything that I could achieveor obtain out in the world.But there was a problem. And the problem was that:I wanted the entirety of the object,I wanted the weight behind the object.This thing was made of resin and it was too light.There's this group online that I frequent.It's a group of prop crazies just like mecalled the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade,make and travel in information about movie props.And it turned out that one of the guys there,a friend of mine that I never actually met,but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.He took my master Falcon pattern,he actually did lost wax castingin bronze for me,and this is the bronze I got back.And this is, after some acid etching, the one that I ended up with.And this thing, it's deeply, deeply satisfying to me.Here, I'm going to put it out there,later on tonight, andI want you to pick it up and handle it.You want to knowhow obsessed I am. This project's only for me,and yet I went so far as to buy on eBaya 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper,in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...like it is in the movie.(Laughter)Yeah, I know!(Laughter) (Applause)There you can see, it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds.That's half the weight of my dog, Huxley.But there's a problem.Now, here's the most recent progression of Falcons.On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay.There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon,because I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting,there's my master and there's my bronze.There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things,which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin,you lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one,it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.Yeah, no, really, this was like aah --why didn't I remember this?Why didn't I start and make it bigger?So what do I do? I figure I have two options.One, I can fire a freaking laser at it,which I have already done,to do a 3D scan -- there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achievedgoing from a wax master to a bronze masterand blown this up big enough to makea 3D lithography master of this,which I will polish, then I will send to the mold makerand then I will have it done in bronze. Or:There are several people who own originals,and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them,hoping that they will let me spend a few minutesin the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture,or even to pull out the hand-held laser scannerthat I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box,and could maybe, without even touching their bird, I swear,get a perfect 3D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pagessaying that I'll never let anyone else have it, except for me in my office, I promise.I'll give them one if they want it.And then, maybe, then I'll achieve the end of this exercise.But really, if we're all going to be honest with ourselves,I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercisewas never the point of the exercise to begin with, was it.Thank you.

So, here we go: a flyby of play.It's got to be serious if the New York Timesputs a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play.At the bottom of this, it says, "It's deeper than gender.Seriously, but dangerously fun.And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution."Not bad, except if you look at that cover, what's missing?You see any adults?Well, lets go back to the 15th century.This is a courtyard in Europe,and a mixture of 124 different kinds of play.All ages, solo play, body play, games, taunting.And there it is. And I think this is a typical pictureof what it was like in a courtyard then.I think we may have lost something in our culture.So I'm gonna take you throughwhat I think is a remarkable sequence.North of Churchill, Manitoba, in October and November,there's no ice on Hudson Bay.And this polar bear that you see, this 1200-pound male,he's wild and fairly hungry.And Norbert Rosing, a German photographer,is there on scene, making a series of photos of these huskies, who are tethered.And from out of stage left comes this wild, male polar bear,with a predatory gaze.Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you,there is a fixed kind of predatory gazethat you know you're in trouble.But on the other side of that predatory gazeis a female husky in a play bow, wagging her tail.And something very unusual happens.That fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereotypedand ends up with a meal -- changes.And this polar bearstands over the husky,no claws extended, no fangs taking a look.And they begin an incredible ballet.A play ballet.This is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous natureand what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death.And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear,and look a little more closely, they're in an altered state.They're in a state of play.And it's that statethat allows these two creatures to explore the possible.They are beginning to do something that neither would have donewithout the play signals.And it is a marvelous exampleof how a differential in powercan be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us.Now how did I get involved in this?John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers, and I have.The Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes,in retrospect, when we studied his tragic mass murder,to the importance of play,in that that individual, by deep study,was found to have severe play deprivation.Charles Whitman was his name.And our committee, which consisted of a lot of hard scientists,did feel at the end of that studythat the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal playled him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated.And that finding has stood the test of time --unfortunately even into more recent times, at Virginia Tech.And other studies of populations at risksensitized me to the importance of play,but I didn't really understand what it was.And it was many years in taking play histories of individualsbefore I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it.And I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it, by any means.But there are ways of looking at itthat I think can give you -- give us all a taxonomy, a way of thinking about it.And this image is, for humans, the beginning point of play.When that mother and infant lock eyes,and the infant's old enough to have a social smile,what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother.And she begins to babble and coo and smile, and so does the baby.If we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram,the right brain of each of them becomes attuned,so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenesand the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on.And I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex playbuilds on this base for us humans.And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play,but it's never just singularly one thing.We're going to look at body play,which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity.This is a mountain goat.If you're having a bad day, try this:jump up and down, wiggle around -- you're going to feel better.And you may feel like this character,who is also just doing it for its own sake.It doesn't have a particular purpose, and that's what's great about play.If its purpose is more importantthan the act of doing it, it's probably not play.And there's a whole other type of play, which is object play.And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball,and he or she's going to roll down a hill.And -- they don't throw it at each other, but this is a fundamental part of being playful.The human hand, in manipulation of objects,is the hand in search of a brain;the brain is in search of a hand;and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way.JPL we heard this morning -- JPL is an incredible place.They have located two consultants,Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson,who are -- Frank Wilson is a neurologist, Nate Johnson is a mechanic.He taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach,and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems.And he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion, quite on his own,that the students who could no longer solve problems, such as fixing cars,hadn't worked with their hands.Frank Wilson had written a book called "The Hand."They got together -- JPL hired them.Now JPL, NASA and Boeing,before they will hire a research and development problem solver --even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech --if they haven't fixed cars, haven't done stuff with their hands early in life,played with their hands, they can't problem-solve as well.So play is practical, and it's very important.Now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration. (Laughter)But it has to be safe exploration.This happens to be OK -- he's an anatomically interested little boyand that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good.But curiosity, exploration, are part of the play scene.If you want to belong, you need social play.And social play is part of what we're about here today,and is a byproduct of the play scene.Rough and tumble play.These lionesses, seen from a distance, looked like they were fighting.But if you look closely, they're kind of like the polar bear and husky:no claws, flat fur, soft eyes,open mouth with no fangs, balletic movements,curvilinear movements -- all specific to play.And rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us.Preschool kids, for example, should be allowed to dive, hit, whistle,scream, be chaotic, and develop through that a lot of emotional regulationand a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive, emotional and physical --that come as a part of rough and tumble play.Spectator play, ritual play -- we're involved in some of that.Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment -- rare --where the Red Sox won the World Series.But take a look at the face and the body language of everybodyin this fuzzy picture, and you can get a sense that they're all at play.Imaginative play.I love this picture because my daughter, who's now almost 40, is in this picture,but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination,her ability to spin yarns at this age -- preschool.A really important part of being a playeris imaginative solo play.And I love this one, because it's also what we're about.We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story.The unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story.I'm telling you a story today about play.Well, this bushman, I think, is talking about the fish that got away that was that long,but it's a fundamental part of the play scene.So what does play do for the brain?Well, a lot.We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain,because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play.I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant.They'd given me a large grant when I was an academicianfor the study of felony drunken drivers, and I thought I had a pretty good track record,and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play,it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious.I think that -- that's a few years back -- I think that wave is past,and the play wave is cresting,because there is some good science.Nothing lights up the brain like play.Three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum,puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe --the executive portion -- helps contextual memory be developed,and -- and, and, and.So it's -- for me, its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventureto look at the neuroscience that's associated with play, and to bring together peoplewho in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way.And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about.And this is one of the ways you can study play --is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram.I'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility,which has limited the actual study of play.And we've got a mother-infant play scenariothat we're hoping to complete underway at the moment.The reason I put this here is also to queue upmy thoughts about objectifying what play does.The animal world has objectified it.In the animal world, if you take rats,who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile yearsand you suppress play -- they squeak, they wrestle,they pin each other, that's part of their play.If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with,and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with,and then you present those ratswith a cat odor-saturated collar,they're hardwired to flee and hide.Pretty smart -- they don't want to get killed by a cat.So what happens?They both hide out.The non-players never come out --they die.The players slowly explore the environment,and begin again to test things out.That says to me, at least in rats --and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we doand a similar cortical architecture --that play may be pretty important for our survival.And, and, and -- there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about.Now, this is a consequence of play deprivation. (Laughter)This took a long time --I had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECTand multiple EEGs, but as a couch potato, his brain has shrunk.And we do know that in domestic animalsand others, when they're play deprived,they don't -- and rats also -- they don't develop a brain that is normal.Now, the program says that the opposite of play is not work,it's depression.And I think if you think about life without play --no humor, no flirtation, no movies,no games, no fantasy and, and, and.Try and imagine a culture or a life, adult or otherwisewithout play.And the thing that's so unique about our speciesis that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime.And we all have capacity to play signal.Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago.What's going to follow from that behavioris play.And you can trust it.The basis of human trust is established through play signals.And we begin to lose those signals, culturally and otherwise, as adults.That's a shame.I think we've got a lot of learning to do.Now, Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps.So part of the signaling system of playhas to do with vocal, facial, body, gestural.You know, you can tell -- and I think when we're getting into collective play,its really important for groups to gain a sense of safetythrough their own sharing of play signals.You may not know this word,but it should be your biological first name and last name.Because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood.And we are, by physical anthropologists,by many, many studies, the most neotenous,the most youthful, the most flexible, the most plastic of all creatures.And therefore, the most playful.And this gives us a leg up on adaptability.Now, there is a way of looking at playthat I also want to emphasize here,which is the play history.Your own personal play history is unique,and often is not something we think about particularly.This is a book written by a consummate playerby the name of Kevin Carroll.Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances:alcoholic mother, absent father, inner-city Philadelphia,black, had to take care of a younger brother.Found that when he looked at a playgroundout of a window into which he had been confined,he felt something different.And so he followed up on it.And his life -- the transformation of his lifefrom deprivation and what one would expect -- potentially prison or death --he become a linguist, a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker.And he gives play as a transformative forceover his entire life.Now there's another play history that I think is a work in progress.Those of you who remember Al Gore,during the first term and then during his successfulbut unelected run for the presidency,may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person,at least in public.And looking at his history, which is common in the press,it seems to me, at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view --that a lot of his life was programmed.Summers were hard, hard work, in the heat of Tennessee summers.He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C.And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play --because I do know something about that --he wasn't as empowered, I think, as he now isby paying attention to what is his own passionand his own inner drive,which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history.So what I would encourage on an individual level to do,is to explore backwards as far as you can goto the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have,whether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation.And begin to build to build from the emotion of thatinto how that connects with your life now.And you'll find, you may change jobs --which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this --in order to be more empowered through their play.Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing itand paying attention to it.Most of us work with groups, and I put this up becausethe d.school, the design school at Stanford,thanks to David Kelley and a lot of otherswho have been visionary about its establishment,has allowed a group of us to get togetherand create a course called "From Play to Innovation."And you'll see this course is to investigatethe human state of play, which is kind of like the polar bear-husky stateand its importance to creative thinking:"to explore play behavior, its development and its biological basis;to apply those principles, through design thinking,to promote innovation in the corporate world;and the students will work with real-world partnerson design projects with widespread application."This is our maiden voyage in this.We're about two and a half, three months into it, and it's really been fun.There is our star pupil, this labrador,who taught a lot of us what a state of play is,and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there.And Brendan Boyle, Rich Crandall -- and on the far right is, I think, a person whowill be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize -- Stuart Thompson,in neuroscience.So we've had Brendan, who's from IDEO,and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these studentsas they put play principles into practice in the classroom.And one of their projects was tosee what makes meetings boring,and to try and do something about it.So what will follow is a student-made filmabout just that.Narrator: Flow is the mental state of apparitionin which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing.Characterized by a feeling of energized focus,full involvement and success in the process of the activity.An important key insight that we learned about meetingsis that people pack them in one after another,disruptive to the day.Attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the taskthat they left at their desk.But it doesn't have to be that way.(Music)Some sage and repeatedly furry monksat this place called the d.schooldesigned a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over.Take the meeting off, and have peace of mind that you can come back to me.Because when you need it again,the meeting is literally hanging in your closet.The Wearable Meeting.Because when you put it on, you immediately get everything you needto have a fun and productive and useful meeting.But when you take it off --that's when the real action happens.(Music)(Laughter) (Applause)Stuart Brown: So I would encourage you allto engagenot in the work-play differential --where you set aside time to play --but where your life becomes infusedminute by minute, hour by hour,with body,object,social, fantasy, transformational kinds of play.And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life.Thank You.(Applause)John Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is thatthere may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your workand go --I think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play,that somehow,the way animals and humans deal with play,is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity.Your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong.SB: Yeah, I don't think that's accurate,and I think probably because animals have taught us that.If you stop a cat from playing --which you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff --they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played.And if you imagine a kidpretending to be King Kong,or a race car driver, or a fireman,they don't all become race car drivers or firemen, you know.So there's a disconnect between preparation for the future --which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as --and thinking of it as a separate biological entity.And this is where my chasing animals for four, five yearsreally changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now,which is that play has a biological place,just like sleep and dreams do.And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically,animals sleep and dream,and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memoryand that are a very important part of sleep and dreams.The next step of evolution in mammals andcreatures with divinely superfluous neuronswill be to play.And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bearor you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experiencesets play aside as something separate.And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain.So it's not just something you do in your spare time.JH: How do you keep -- and I know you're part of the scientific research community,and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else --how do you prevent --and some of the data that you've produced, the good science that you're talking about you've produced, is hot to handle.How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your workor the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work,kind of like the Mozart metaphor,where, "Oh, MRIs showthat play enhances your intelligence.Well, let's round these kids up, put them in pensand make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard."How do you prevent people from taking that sort of actionon the data that you're developing?SB: Well, I think the only way I know to do itis to have accumulated the advisers that I havewho go from practitioners --who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever --a state of play.So people know that it's there.And then you get an fMRI specialist, and you get Frank Wilson,and you get other kinds of hard scientists, including neuroendocrinologists.And you get them into a group together focused on play,and it's pretty hard not to take it seriously.Unfortunately, that hasn't been done sufficientlyfor the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Mental Healthor anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously.I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart diseaseassociated with play.And yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival -- long term --as learning some of the basic things about public health.JH: Stuart Brown, thank you very much.(Applause)

now isby paying attention to what is his own passionand his own inner drive,which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history.So what I would encourage on an individual level to do,is to explore backwards as far as you can goto the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have,whether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation.And begin to build to build from the emotion of thatinto how that connects with your life now.And you'll find, you may change jobs --which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this --in order to be more empowered through their play.Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing itand paying attention to it.Most of us work with groups, and I put this up becausethe d.school, the design school at Stanford,thanks to David Kelley and a lot of otherswho have been visionary about its establishment,has allowed a group of us to get togetherand create a course called "From Play to Innovation."And you'll see this course is to investigatethe human state of play, which is kind of like the polar bear-husky stateand its importance to creative thinking:"to explore play behavior, its development and its biological basis;to apply those principles, through design thinking,to promote innovation in the corporate world;and the students will work with real-world partnerson design projects with widespread application."This is our maiden voyage in this.We're about two and a half, three months into it, and it's really been fun.There is our star pupil, this labrador,who taught a lot of us what a state of play is,and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there.And Brendan Boyle, Rich Crandall -- and on the far right is, I think, a person whowill be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize -- Stuart Thompson,in neuroscience.So we've had Brendan, who's from IDEO,and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these studentsas they put play principles into practice in the classroom.And one of their projects was tosee what makes meetings boring,and to try and do something about it.So what will follow is a student-made filmabout just that.Narrator: Flow is the mental state of apparitionin which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing.Characterized by a feeling of energized focus,full involvement and success in the process of the activity.An important key insight that we learned about meetingsis that people pack them in one after another,disruptive to the day.Attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the taskthat they left at their desk.But it doesn't have to be that way.(Music)Some sage and repeatedly furry monksat this place called the d.schooldesigned a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over.Take the meeting off, and have peace of mind that you can come back to me.Because when you need it again,the meeting is literally hanging in your closet.The Wearable Meeting.Because when you put it on, you immediately get everything you needto have a fun and productive and useful meeting.But when you take it off --that's when the real action happens.(Music)(Laughter) (Applause)Stuart Brown: So I would encourage you allto engagenot in the work-play differential --where you set aside time to play --but where your life becomes infusedminute by minute, hour by hour,with body,object,social, fantasy, transformational kinds of play.And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life.Thank You.(Applause)John Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is thatthere may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your workand go --I think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play,that somehow,the way animals and humans deal with play,is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity.Your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong.SB: Yeah, I don't think that's accurate,and I think probably because animals have taught us that.If you stop a cat from playing --which you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff --they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played.And if you imagine a kidpretending to be King Kong,or a race car driver, or a fireman,they don't all become race car drivers or firemen, you know.So there's a disconnect between preparation for the future --which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as --and thinking of it as a separate biological entity.And this is where my chasing animals for four, five yearsreally changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now,which is that play has a biological place,just like sleep and dreams do.And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically,animals sleep and dream,and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memoryand that are a very important part of sleep and dreams.The next step of evolution in mammals andcreatures with divinely superfluous neuronswill be to play.And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bearor you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experiencesets play aside as something separate.And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain.So it's not just something you do in your spare time.JH: How do you keep -- and I know you're part of the scientific research community,and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else --how do you prevent --and some of the data that you've produced, the good science that you're talking about you've produced, is hot to handle.How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your workor the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work,kind of like the Mozart metaphor,where, "Oh, MRIs showthat play enhances your intelligence.Well, let's round these kids up, put them in pensand make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard."How do you prevent people from taking that sort of actionon the data that you're developing?SB: Well, I think the only way I know to do itis to have accumulated the advisers that I havewho go from practitioners --who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever --a state of play.So people know that it's there.And then you get an fMRI specialist, and you get Frank Wilson,and you get other kinds of hard scientists, including neuroendocrinologists.And you get them into a group together focused on play,and it's pretty hard not to take it seriously.Unfortunately, that hasn't been done sufficientlyfor the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Mental Healthor anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously.I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart diseaseassociated with play.And yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival -- long term --as learning some of the basic things about public health.JH: Stuart Brown, thank you very much.(Applause)

The "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were calledto a little town in Colorado, called Craig.It's only a couple dozen square miles. It's in the Rockies.And the job in question was sheep rancher.My role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple.I'm an apprentice, and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question.And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep upand give an honest account of what it's like to be these people,for one day in their life.The job in question: herding sheep. Great.We go to Craig and we check in to a hoteland I realize the next day that castrationis going to be an absolute part of this work.So, normally, I never do any research at all.But, this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel,and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do,and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals.So I called the Humane Societyand I say, "Look, I'm going to be castrating some lambs,Can you tell me the deal?"And they're like, "Yeah, it's pretty straightforward."They use a band -- basically a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller.This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday,but it had a certain familiarity to it.And I said, "Well, what exactly is the process?"And they said, "The band is applied to the tail, tightly.And then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly.Blood flow is slowly retarded;a week later the parts in question fall off."Great -- got it."OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this -- they confirm it.I also call PETA, just for fun, and they don't like it -- but they confirm it.OK, that's basically how you do it.So the next day I go out.And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambsand we take them to a pen that we built,and we go about the business of animal husbandry.Melanie is the wife of Albert.Albert is the shepherd in question.Melanie picks up the lamb -- two hands --one hand on both legs on the right, likewise on the left.Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.Alright. Great.Albert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around.I always watch the process done the first time before I try it.Being an apprentice, you know, you do that.Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber bandbut what comes out instead is a knife.And I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know.And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sunthat was just coming over the Rockies, it was very --it was, it was impressive.In the space of about two seconds, Albert had the knifebetween the cartilage of the tail, right next to the butt of the lamb,and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding.A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger,he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.And he pulled it toward him, like so,and he took the knife and he put it on the tip.Now you think you know what's coming, Michael -- you don't, OK?He snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder,and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward,and then his head dips down, obscuring my view,but what I hear is a slurping sound,and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky walland I am not even kidding.Can we roll the video?No I'm kidding -- we don't --(Laughter)I thought it best to talk in pictures.So, I do something now I've never ever done on a "Dirty Jobs" shoot, ever.I say, "Time out. Stop."You guys know the show, we use take one, we don't do take two.There's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense.We don't fool around, we don't rehearse --we shoot what we get!I said, "Stop. This is nuts."I mean, you know.(Laughter)"This is crazy.We can't do this."And Albert's like, "What?"And I'm like, "I don't know what just happened,but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it."And he said "Well, that's how we do it."And I said, "Why would you do it this way?"And before I even let him explain,I said, "I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands."And he says, "Like the Humane Society?"And I said, "Yes, like the Humane Society.Let's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed --we're on in five continents, dude.We're on twice a day on the Discovery Channel -- we can't do this."He says, "OK."He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.Melanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post,band goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum.Lamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down,gets up, shakes a little,takes another couple steps, falls down.I'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all.Gets up, walks to the corner, it's quivering,and it lies down and it's in obvious distress.And I'm looking at the lamb and I say, "Albert, how long?When does he get up?"He's like, "A day."I said, "A day! How long does it take them to fall off?""A week."Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just did his little procedure onis, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped.He's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking.And I was just so blown awayat how wrong I was, in that second.And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time.(Laughter)And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that daybecause now I had to do what Albert had just done,and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen,and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno,and I'm like ... (Laughter)Melanie picks up the lamb,puts it on the post, opens it up.Albert hands me the knife.I go in, tail comes off.I go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off.Albert instructs, "Push it way up there."I do."Push it further."I do.The testicles emerge -- they look like thumbs, coming right at you --and he says, "Bite 'em.Just bite 'em off."And I heard him, I heard all the words.(Laughter)Like, how did -- how did I get here?How did -- you know -- I mean --how did I get here?(Laughter)It's just -- it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own:and suddenly, I'm standing there, in the Rockies,and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy.You know, Aristotle says a tragedyis that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity.(Laughter)And I'm like, "What is this jacked-up metaphor?I don't like what I'm thinking right now."And I can't get this thought out of my head,and I can't get that vision out of my sight,so I did what I had to do.I went in and I took them.I took them like this,and I yanked my face back.And I'm standing therewith two testicles on my chin.(Laughter)And now I can't get -- I can't shake the metaphor.OK, I'm still in "Poetics," in Aristotle,and I'm thinking -- out of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my headthat I haven't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there.And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia.Anagnorisis and peripeteia.Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery.Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis.It's what our network does;it's what "Dirty Jobs" is.And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day.Great.The other word, peripeteia,that's the moment in the great tragedies, you know --Euripides and Sophocles --the moment where Oedipus has his moment,where he suddenly realizes that hot chickhe's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother. OK.That's peripetyor peripeteia.And this metaphor in my head --I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin.(Laughter)I got to tell you, it's such a great device though.When you start to look for peripetia,you find it everywhere.I mean, Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense," right?Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people,and then, boom -- "Oh, I'm dead" -- peripetia.You know?It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way.Neo in "The Matrix," you know?"Oh, I'm living in a computer program" -- that's weird.These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations;and I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs, I have them all the time,but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for.And, as I stood there,looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled --but it looked OK.Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on,and I just was struck byif I'm wrong about thatand if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way,what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon?Because, look, I'm not a social anthropologistbut I have a friend who is.And I talk to him.(Laughter)And he says, "Hey Mike.Look, I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not,but do you realize you've shot in every state?You've worked in mining, you've worked in fishing,you've worked in steel, you've worked in every major industry.You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guysthat our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right?"I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye,dribbling down her chin, with the steel workers.I mean, these are the people that I work with every single day."And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively,it might be time to think about it.Because, dude, you know, four years."You know, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin,thoughts are bouncing around.And, after that shoot, Dirty Jobs really didn't change,in terms of what the show is,but it changed for me, personally.And now, when I talk about the show,I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it.I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong,some of the other notions of workthat I've just been assuming are sacrosanct,and they're not.People with dirty jobs are happier than you think.As a group, they're the happiest people I know.And I don't want to start whistling "Look for the Union Label,"and all that happy worker crap.I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work.Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work. I swear to God --I did it with them.They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life.And I see it over and over and over again.So I started to wonder what would happenif we challenged some of these sacred cows.Follow your passion --we've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.Follow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that?Probably the worst advice I ever got.(Laughter)You know, follow your dreams and go broke, right?I mean, that's all I heard growing up.I didn't know what to do with my life,but I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out.I can give you 30 examples, right now --Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegaswho collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinosand feeds them them to his swine.Why? Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eathis pigs grow at twice the normal speed,and he is one rich pig farmer,and he is good for the environment,and he spends his days doing this incredible service,and he smells like hell, but God bless him.He's making a great living.You ask him, "Did you follow your passion here?"and he'd laugh at you.The guy's worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farmand turned it down, outside of Vegas.He didn't follow his passion.He stepped back and he watched where everybody was goingand he went the other way.And I hear that story over and over.Matt Froind, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut,who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cowswas worth more than their milk,if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots.Now, he's selling them to Walmart.Follow his passion? The guy's -- come on.So I started to look at passion,I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness --as Tim talked about earlier, that's a huge distinction.I started to look at teamwork and determination,and basically all those platitudes they call "successories"that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now.That stuff --it's suddenly all been turned on its head.Safety -- safety first?Going back to, you know, OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society:what if OSHA got it wrong?I mean -- this is heresy, what I'm about to say --but what if it's really safety third?Right?(Laughter)No, I mean really.What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobsas much as the people that I'm working with,but the ones who really get it done,they're not out there talking about safety first.They know that other things come first --the business of doing the work comes first,the business of getting it done.And I'll never forget, up in the Bering Sea, I was on a crab boatwith the "Deadliest Catch" guys -- which I also work on -- in the first season.We're about 100 miles off the coast of Russia:50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right?Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen,and I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down.So, I'm 40 feet off the deck,which is like looking down at the top of your shoe,you know, and it's doing this in the ocean.Unspeakably dangerous.I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouseand I say, with some level of incredulity,"Captain, OSHA."And he says, "OSHA? Ocean."And he points out there.(Laughter)But in that moment, what he said next can't be repeated in the lower 48.It can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site.But he looked at me, and he said, "Son" --he's my age, by the way, he calls me son, I love that --he says, "Son, I'm a captain of a crab boat.My responsibility is not to get you home alive.My responsibility is to get you home rich."(Laughter)You want to get home alive, that's on you.And for the rest of that day, safety first.I was like --So, the idea that we create this false --this sense of complacencywhen all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibilityas though it's our own, and vice versa.Anyhow, a whole lot of things.I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we madeand the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.But, what it all comes down to is this.I formed a theory, and I'm going to share it nowin my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds.It goes like this --we've declared war on work,as a society, all of us.It's a civil war.It's a cold war, really.We didn't set out to do itand we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way,but we've done it.And we've waged this war on at least four fronts,certainly in Hollywood.The way we portray working people on TV --it's laughable.If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds and he's got a giant butt crack. Admit it.You see him all the time.That's what plumbers look like, right?We turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines.That's what TV does.We try hard on "Dirty Jobs" not to do that,which is why I do the work and I don't cheat.But, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue.I mean, so many of the commercials that come out there --in the way of a message, what's really being said?Your life would be better if you could work a little less,if you didn't have to work so hard, if you could get home a little earlier,if you could retire a little faster, if you could punch out a little sooner --it's all in there, over and over, again and again.Washington? I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in placethat affect the bottom line reality of the available jobsbecause I don't really know.I just know that that's a front in this war.And right here guys, Silicon Valley,I mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now?How many people have their Blackberries?We're plugged in; we're connected.I would never suggest for a secondthat something bad has come out of the tech revolution.Good grief, not to this crowd.(Laughter)But I would suggest that innovation without imitationis a complete waste of time.And nobody celebrates imitationthe way "Dirty Jobs" guys know it has to be done.Your iPhone without those people making the same interface,the same circuitry, the same board, over and over?All of that? That's what makes it equally as possibleas the genius that goes inside of it.So, we've got this new toolbox, you know.Our tools today don't look like shovels and picks.They look like the stuff we walk around with.And so the collective effect of all of thathas been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs.And I realized, probably too late in this game --I hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things --but we're going to do as many as we can.And to me the most important thing to knowand to really come face to face with,is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things,not just the testicles on my chin.I got a lot wrong.So, we're thinking -- by we, I mean me --that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work,manual labor, skilled labor.Somebody needs to be out theretalking about the forgotten benefits.I'm talking about grandfather stuff,the stuff a lot us probably grew up withbut we've kind of -- you know, kind of losta little.Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs.The infrastructure is a huge deal.This war on work, that I suppose exists, has casualtieslike any other war.The infrastructure's the first one;declining trade-school enrollments are the second one.Every single year: fewer electricians,fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers,fewer welders, fewer pipefitters,fewer steamfitters.The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creatingare those guys --the ones that have been in decline, over and over.Meanwhile, we've got two trillion dollars -- at a minimum,according to the American Society of Civil Engineers --that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure,which is currently rated at a D minus.So, if I were running for anything, and I'm not,I would simply say that the jobs we hope to makeand the jobs we hope to createaren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.And I know the point of this conferenceis to celebrate things that are near and dear to us,but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites.They're two sides of the same coin,just like innovation and imitation,like risk and responsibility,like peripetia and anagnorisis,like that poor little lamb, who I hope isn't quivering anymore,and like my time that's gone.It's been great talking to youand get back to work, will you?(Applause)

Back in 1992, I started working for a companycalled Interval Research,which was just then being foundedby David Lidell and Paul Allenas a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley.I met with Davidto talk about what I might do in his company.I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality businessand supporting myself by being on the speaking circuitand writing books --after twenty years or so in the computer game industryhaving ideas that people didn't think they could sell.And David and I discoveredthat we had a question in common,that we really wanted the answer to,and that was,"Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?"Why is that?It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy.These people aren't that smart.There's six billion dollars on the table.They would go for it if they could figure out how.So, what is the deal here?And as we thought about our goals --I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution,in the classical sensethat humanism, at its best,finds a way to combine clear-eyed empirical researchwith a set of core valuesthat fundamentally love and respect people.The basic idea of humanismis the improvable quality of life;that we can do good things,that there are things worth doingbecause they're good things to do,and that clear-eyed empiricismcan help us figure out how to do them.So, contrary to popular belief,there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values.And Interval Research is kind of the living exampleof how that can be true.So David and I decided to go find out,through the best research we could muster,what it would take to get a little girlto put her hands on a computer,to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technologythat little boys have because they play video games.We spent two and a half years conducting research;we spent another year and a half in advance development.Then we formed a spin-off company.In the research phase of the project at Interval,we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research,and these people -- Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland --changed my mind entirely about what market research wasand what it could be.They taught me how to look and see,and they did not do the incredibly stupid thingof saying to a child,"Of all these things we already make you,which do you like best?" --which gives you zero answers that are usable.So, what we did for the first two and a half yearswas four things:We did an extensive review of the literaturein related fields, like cognitive psychology,spatial cognition, gender studies,play theory, sociology, primatology.Thank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are,I love you and I'd give anything to meet you.After we had done that with a pretty large team of peopleand discovered what we thought the salient issues werewith girls and boys and playing --because, after all, that's really what this is about --we moved to the second phase of our work,where we interviewed adult expertsin academia, some of the peoplewho'd produced the literature that we found relevant.Also, we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day,like playground supervisors. We talked to them,confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questionsabout gender difference and play.Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work:interviewed 1,100 children, boys and girls,ages seven to 12, all over the United States --except for Silicon Valley, Boston and Austinbecause we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in themand they wouldn't be a representative sample.And at the end of those remarkable conversationswith kids and their best friends across the United States,after two years, we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children,drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research,and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics,for designing computer-based products --and, in fact, any kind of products -- for little girls, ages eight to 12.And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer softwareand testing them with little girls.In 1996, in November, we formed the company Purple Moonwhich was a spinoff of Interval Research,and our chief investors were Interval Research, Vulcan Northwest,Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company.We launched a website on September 2ndthat has now served 25 million pages,and has 42,000 registered young girl users.They visit an average of one and a half times a day,spend an average of 35 minutes a visit,and look at 50 pages a visit.So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls.We launched two titles in October --"Rockett's New School" -- the first of a seriesof products -- is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of schoolin eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate,which allows girls to play with the question of, "What will I be like when I'm older?""What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school?Who are my friends?";to exercise the love of social complexityand the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior;and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choicesin our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves.The other title that we launched is called "Secret Paths in the Forest,"which addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls.These two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data --entertainment titles in PC Datain December, right up there with "John Madden Football,"which thrills me to death.So, we're real,and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls.We've made half-a-billion impressionswith marketing and PR for this brand, Purple Moon.Ninety-six percent of them, roughly, have been positive;four percent of them have been "other."I want to talk about the other,because the politics of this enterprise, in a way,have been the most fascinating part of it, for me.There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received.One kind of reviewer is a male gamerwho thinks he knows what games ought to be,and won't show the product to little girls.The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feministwho thinks they know what little girls ought to be.And so it's funny to me that these interesting, odd bedfellowshave one thing in common:they don't listen to little girls.They haven't looked at childrenand they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them.I'd like to play you some voices of little girlsfrom the two-and-a-half years of research that we did --actually, some of the voices are more recent.And these voices will be accompanied by photographsthat they took for us of their lives,of the things that they value and care about.These are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to usThis is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening toand this is the kind of research I recommend to thosewho want to do humanistic work.Girl 1: Yeah, my character is usually a tomboy.Hers is more into boys.Girl 2: Uh, yeah.Girl 1: We have -- in the very beginning of the whole game, always we do this:we each have a piece of paper; we write down our name, our age --are we rich, very rich, not rich, poor, medium, wealthy,boyfriends, dogs, pets -- what else -- sisters, brothers, and all those.Girl 2: Divorced -- parents divorced, maybe.Girl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one.Girl 4: We make a school newspaper on the computer.Girl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenerywith clouds and flowers.Girl 6: Like, if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy,you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy.Girl 7: I run track, I played soccer,I play basketball, and I love a lot of things to do.And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation,like when I get Mondays and all those days off.Girl 8: Well, sometimes there is a lot of stuff going onbecause I have music lessons and I'm on swim team --all this different stuff that I have to do,and sometimes it gets overwhelming.Girl 9: My friend Justinekinda took my friend Kelly, and now they're being mean to me.Girl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters,or brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea firstand they take your idea and they do it themselves.Girl 11: Because my older sister, she gets everythingand, like, when I ask my mom for something, she'll say, "No" -- all the time.But she gives my sister everything.Brenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minuteof "Rockett's Tricky Decision," which went gold two days ago.Let's hope it's really stable.This is the second day in Rockett's life.The reason I'm showing you thisis I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiarand sound familiar, now that you've listened to some girls' voices.And you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to themin the game that we've created.Miko: Hey Rockett! C'mere!Rockett: Hi Miko! What's going on?Miko: Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend?She asked me to make sure you knew about it.Nakilia invited Reuben too, but --Rockett: But what? Isn't he coming?Miko: I don't think so.I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night.Rockett: Really? What other party?Girl: Max's party is going to be so cool, Whitney.He's invited all the best people.BL: I'm going to fast-forward to the decision pointbecause I know I don't have a lot of time.After this awful event occurs, Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it.Rockett: Who'd want to show up at that party anyway?I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to.Gee, I doubt I'll make Max's best people list.BL: OK, so we're going to emotionally navigate.If we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters,we can go into this hidden hallway,and I'll quickly just show you the interface.We can, for example, go find Miko's lockerand get some more information about her.Oops, I turned the wrong way.But you get the general idea of the product.I wanted to show you the ways, innocuous as they seem,in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls --their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility,and to play around with the social complexity of their lives.I want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort,is a kind of validation,a sense of being seen.And a sense of the choices that are available in their lives.We love them.We see them.We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be.But we're really, really happy about who they are.It turns out they're really great.I want to close by showing you a videotapethat's a version of a future game in the Rockett seriesthat our graphic artists and design people put together,that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers."Rockett 28!"Rockett: It's like I'm just waking up, you know?BL: Thanks.

Four years ago, on the TED stage,I announced a company I was working with at the timecalled Odeo.And because of that announcement,we got a big article in The New York Times,which led to more press, which led to more attention,and me deciding to become CEO of that company --whereas I was just an adviser --and raising a round of venture capitaland ramping up hiring.One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey,and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo,Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of yearsthat was based around sending simple status updates to friends.We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo,so we kind of put two and two together,and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo.Now, it's hard to justify doing a side projectat a startup, where focus is so critical,but I had actually launched Blogger as a side projectto my previous company,thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side,and it ended up taking over not only the company,but my life for the next five or six years.So I learned to follow huncheseven though you can't necessarily justify themor know where they're going to go.And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time.So, for those of you unfamiliar,Twitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept.You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less,and people who are interested in you get those updates.If they're really interested,they get the update as a text message on their cell phone.So, for instance, I may Twitter right nowthat I'm giving a talk at TED.And in my case, when I hit send,up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds.Now, the fundamental idea is that Twitterlets people share moments of their liveswhenever they want,be they momentous occasionsor mundane ones.It is by sharing these moments as they're happeningthat lets people feel more connected and in touch,despite distance, and in real time.This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning,and what got us excited.What we didn't anticipate was the many, many other usesthat would evolve from this very simple system.One of the things we realizedwas how important Twitter could be during real-time events.When the wildfires broke out in San Diego,in October of 2007,people turned to Twitter to report what was happeningand to find information from neighborsabout what was happening around them.But it wasn't just individuals.The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well,and put a Twitter feed on the front page,and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Crossused it to dispense news and updates as well.At this event, dozens of people here are Twitteringand thousands of people around the world are following alongbecause they want to know what it feels like to be hereand what's happening.Among the other interesting things that have cropped upare many things from businesses,from marketing and communications and predictable things,to an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truckthat drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops,causing a line to form around the block.Politicians have recently begun Twittering.In fact, there are 47 members of Congresswho currently have Twitter accounts.And they're tweeting, in some cases,from behind closed-door sessions with the President.In this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.The President himself is our most popular Twitter user,although his tweets have dropped off as of late,while Senator McCain's have picked up.As have this guy's.Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium:you send one message and it goes out to everybody,and you receive the messages you're interested in.One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitterwas by inventing a way to reply to a specific personor a specific message.So, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using hereto reply to one of his fans,was completely invented by users,and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popularand then we made it easier.This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system.Another is via the API.We built an application-programming interface,which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of softwarethat can send Twitter updates --interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry --as well as things likea device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicksor a plant Twitter when it needs water.Probably the most important third-party developmentcame from a little company in Virginia called Summize.Summize built a Twitter search engine.And they tapped into the factthat, if you have millions of people around the worldtalking about what they're doing and what's around them,you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or eventwhile it's going on.This really changed how we perceived Twitter.For instance, here's what people are saying about TED.This is another way that our mind was shifted,and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.We liked this so much we actually bought the companyand are folding it into the main product.This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways,but it introduces new use cases as well.One of my favorites is what happened a few months agowhen there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.Some users figured outthat they would Twitter when they found gas --where it was, and how much it cost --and then appended the keyword "#atlgas"which let other people search for that and find gas themselves.And this trend of people using this communication networkto help each other outgoes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.It's happened more and more lately,whether it's raising money for homeless peopleor to dig wells in Africaor for a family in crisis.People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitterin a matter of days on several occasions.It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information,more good things happen.I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter.I've learned to follow the hunch,but never assume where it will go.Thanks.(Applause)Chris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.So, look, if we could have this screen live.This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can doafter they've been to an event.It's totally intimidating.So, this would be the Twitter search screen.So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter.For example: "Evan Williams.""Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED.""Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Evan Williams --"Oh."Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED.Worst talk ever!" (Laughter)Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks.CA: Just kidding.But, literally in the eight minutes he was talking,there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.So he'll see every aspect of the reaction:the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer,the fact that it came out of TED.I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way.You have build something very fascinating,and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.So, thank you very much, Evan. EW: Thank you.CA: That was very interesting.

I was raised in Seoul, Korea,and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.I was pre-med at the time,and I thought I would become a surgeonbecause I was interested in anatomyand dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.I started to realize that I could look at the whole cityas a living organism.I wanted to dissect itand look into its unseen layers.And the way to it, for me,was through artistic means.So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.and in grad school I became interestedin creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.In New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.But I took a liking to thembecause they dwell on the fringes of society.And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives,they're also considered pests.I also started looking around in the cityand trying to photograph them.One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the trackshoping to catch a rat or two,and a man came up to me and said,"You can't take photographs here.The MTA will confiscate your camera."I was quite shocked by that,and thought to myself, "Well, OK then.I'll follow the rats."Then I started going into the tunnels,which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the citythat I never saw before and most people don't get to see.Around the same time, I met like-minded individualswho call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers,guerrilla historians, etc.I was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based networkof people who regularly explore urban ruinssuch as abandoned subway stations,tunnels, sewers, aqueducts,factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.When I took photographs in these locations,I felt there was something missing in the pictures.Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structureswasn't enough for me.So I wanted to create a fictional characteror an animal that dwells in these underground spaces,and the simplest way to do it, at the time,was to model myself.I decided against clothingbecause I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implicationsor time-specific elements.I wanted a simple way to represent a living bodyinhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.It's now an empty, six-acre lotwaiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.I was very fond of this spacebecause it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my ownthat is abandoned.When I first went in, I was scared,because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.But they happened to be wild dogs living there,and it was right by the water,so there were swans and ducks swimming aroundand trees growing everywhereand bees nesting in the sugar barrels.The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the pictureto become a part of that nature.When I got comfortable in the space,it also felt like a big playground.I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beamsas if I went back in time and became a child again.This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct,which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.The construction began in 1837.It lasted about five years.It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.When you go into spaces like this,you're directly accessing the past,because they sit untouched for decades.I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home,you're actually feeling the hand-laid bricksand shimmying up and down narrow cracksand getting wet and muddyand walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.The murals were done by a graffiti artistto commemorate the hundreds of homeless peoplethat got relocated from the tunnel in 1991when the tunnel reopened for trains.Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.There's nobody around you,and you hear the kids playing in the park above you,completely unaware of what's underneath.When I was going out a lot to these places,I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolationbecause I was in a solitary phase in my life,and I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen,"which references Charles Baudelaire."Naked City" is a nickname for New York,and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertiathat come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.This is the same tunnel.You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ductsand the train approaching.This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen.I was there alone, setting up,and a homeless man approached.I was basically intruding in his living space.I was really frightened at first,but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art projectand he didn't seem to mindand so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timerand ran back and forth.And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirtto wipe off my feetand kindly walked me out.It must have been a very unusual day for him.(Laughter)One thing that struck me, after this incident,was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.That homeless man, to me, really representedan element of the unconscious of the city.He told me that he was abused above groundand was once in Riker's Island,and at last he found peace and quiet in that space.The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city,but is now a sanctuary for outcasts,who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.This is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.The tunnels are famous for having been usedduring the development of the Manhattan Project.This particular tunnel is interestingbecause it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum,which was demolished in 1890when Columbia moved in.This is the New York City Farm Colony,which was a poorhouse in Staten Islandfrom the 1890s to the 1930s.Most of my photos are set in placesthat have been abandoned for decades,but this is an exception.This children's hospital was closed in 1997;it's located in Newark.When I was there three years ago,the windows were broken and the walls were peeling,but everything was left there as it was.You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machinesand even used utensils,which you see on the autopsy table.After exploring recently-abandoned buildings,I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast:your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church --any man-made structures around you.I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security isand how vulnerable people truly are.I love to travel,and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.It's full of history,and also full of underground bunkersand ruins from the war.This was taken under a homeless asylumbuilt in 1885 to house 1,100 people.I saw the structure while I was on the train,and I got off at the next station and met people therethat gave me access to their catacomb-like basement,which was used for ammunition storage during the warand also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.This is the actual catacombs in Paris.I explored there extensivelyin the off-limits areasand fell in love right away.There are more than 185 miles of tunnels,and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.They were consistently dug as limestone quarriesand by the 18th century,the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats,so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarriesand dug new observation tunnelsin order to monitor and map the whole place.As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.It's very dangerous to get lost in there.And at the same time,there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries,making them into the catacombs.The remains of over six million people are housed in there,some over 1,300 years old.This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemeterywhere most of the ossuaries are located.There are also phone cables that were used in the '50sand many bunkers from the World War II era.This is a German bunker.Nearby there's a French bunker,and the whole tunnel system is so complexthat the two parties never met.The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance,which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."And I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.After exploring the underground of Paris,I decided to climb up,and I climbed a Gothic monumentthat's right in the middle of Paris.This is the Tower of Saint Jacques.It was built in the early 1500s.I don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.It was not very comfortable. (Laughter)And all this time,I never saw a single rat in any of these places,until recently, when I was in the London sewers.This was probably the toughest place to explore.I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes --I guess, except for in this picture.And when the tides of waste matter come init sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.This is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door."I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it.And this is the first theater project I worked on.I adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.It was performed last September one time onlyin the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn,which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world,built in 1844.I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.The last place I visitedwas the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.I like doing more than just exploring these spaces.I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continuallyin order to preserve their memories in a creative way --before they're lost forever.Thank you.

I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakersthat worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.So I want to show you a clip of the film now.Hopefully it won't stutter.And if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved.Voice (Video): I don't know how it's possible ...but you seem to have more hair.Brad Pitt: What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ...but I was getting younger than everybody else?I was born with some form of disease.Voice: What kind of disease?BP: I was born old.Man: I'm sorry.BP: No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age.Girl: Are you sick?BP: I heard momma and Tizzy whisper,and they said I was gonna die soon.But ... maybe not.Girl: You're different than anybody I've ever met.BB: There were many changes ...some you could see, some you couldn't.Hair started growing in all sorts of places,along with other things.I felt pretty good, considering.Ed Ulbrich: That was a clip from "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."Many of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story,but what you might not knowis that for nearly the first hour of the film,the main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt,is completely computer-generated from the neck up.Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeupor photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body.We've created a completely digital human head.So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.Now, this movie has floated around Hollywoodfor well over half a century,and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s,with Ron Howard as the director.We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.But at the time we had to throw in the towel.It was deemed impossible.It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.The human form, in particular the human head,has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry.The project came back to us about a decade later,and this time with a director named David Fincher.Now, Fincher is an interesting guy.David is fearless of technology,and he is absolutely tenacious.And David won't take "no."And David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry,that anything is possibleas long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money.And so David had an interesting take on the film,and he threw a challenge at us.He wanted the main character of the film to be playedfrom the cradle to the grave by one actor.It happened to be this guy.We went through a process of elimination and a process of discoverywith David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors.That was one idea: that we would have different actors,and we would hand off from actor to actor.We even ruled out the idea of using makeup.We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up,particularly in close-up.And makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up.And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's faceto bring the aging to this character.He needed to be a very sympathetic character.So we decided to cast a series of little peoplethat would play the different bodies of Benjaminat the different increments of his lifeand that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head,aged to appear as Benjamin,and attach that to the body of the real actor.Sounded great.Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry,and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either,because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store,you know -- we see his face constantly.So there really was no tolerable margin of error.There were two studios involved: Warner Brothers and Paramount.And they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course,but it was a very high-risk proposition.There was lots of money and reputations at stake.But we believed that we had a very solid methodologythat might work ...But despite our verbal assurances,they wanted some proof.And so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin.And we did it in about five weeks.But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.We basically put something together to get through the meeting.I'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button.And in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head --pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor.And it worked. And it gave the studio great relief.After many years of starts and stops on this project,and making that tough decision,they finally decided to greenlight the movie.And I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us,to say the movie was a go,I actually threw up.(Laughter)You know, this is some tough stuff.So we started to have early team meetings,and we got everybody together,and it was really more like therapy in the beginning,convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this.We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.And of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem. (Laughter)So we had a big problem:we didn't know how we were going to do this.But we did know one thing.Being from the visual effects industry,we, with David, believed that we now had enough time,enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money.And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.So, when you're faced with something like that,of course you've got to break it down.You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller piecesand you start to attack that.So we had three main areas that we had to focus on.We needed to make Brad look a lot older --needed to age him 45 years or so.And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies,his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he isand have that translate through our processso that it appears in Benjamin on the screen.And we also needed to create a characterthat could hold up under, really, all conditions.He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight,at nighttime, under candlelight,he had to hold an extreme close-up,he had to deliver dialogue,he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat,he had to be able to take a bath, to cry,he even had to throw up.Not all at the same time --but he had to, you know, do all of those things.And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.We did about 325 shots.So we needed a system that would allow Benjaminto do everything a human being can do.And we realized that there was a giant chasmbetween the state of the art of technology in 2004and where we needed it to be.So we focused on motion capture.I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture.The state of the art at the timewas something called marker-based motion capture.I'll give you an example here.It's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard,and they put some reflective markers on your body,and instead of using cameras,there're infrared sensors around a volume,and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional positionof those markers in real time.And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markersand apply them to a computer-generated character.You can see the computer characters on the rightare having the same complex motion as the dancers.But we also looked at numbers of other films at the timethat were using facial marker tracking,and that's the idea of putting markers on the human faceand doing the same process.And as you can see, it gives you a pretty crappy performance.That's not terribly compelling.And what we realizedwas that what we neededwas the information that was going on between the markers.We needed the subtleties of the skin.We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things.Our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away fromthe technology of the day, the status quo, the state of the art.So we aborted using motion capture.And we were now well out of our comfort zone,and in uncharted territory.So we were left with this ideathat we ended up calling "technology stew."We started to look out in other fields.The idea was that we were going to findnuggets or gems of technologythat come from other industries like medical imaging,the video game space,and re-appropriate them.And we had to create kind of a sauce.And the sauce was code in softwarethat we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technologyto come together and work as one.Initially, we came across some remarkable researchdone by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s.He believed that he could, in fact,catalog the human face.And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS.He believed that there were 70 basic posesor shapes of the human face,and that those basic poses or shapes of the facecan be combined to create infinite possibilitiesof everything the human face is capable of doing.And of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender.So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward.And then we came across some remarkable technologycalled Contour.And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeupstippled on her face.And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface captureas opposed to a marker capture.The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras,and those cameras can, frame-by-frame,reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment.So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject.And if you look in a comparison,on the left, we see what volumetric data gives usand on the right you see what markers give us.So, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this.But these were the early days of this technology,and it wasn't really proven yet.We measure complexity and fidelity of datain terms of polygonal count.And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons.We could go up into the millions of polygons.It seemed to be infinite.This was when we had our "Aha!"This was the breakthrough.This is when we're like, "OK, we're going to be OK,This is actually going to work."And the "Aha!" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt,and we could put Brad in this device,and use this Contour process,and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeupand put him under the black lights,and we could, in fact, scan him in real timeperforming Ekman's FACS poses.Right? So, effectively,we ended up with a 3D databaseof everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing.(Laughter)From there, we actually carved up those facesinto smaller pieces and components of his face.So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes,a complete database of all possibilitiesthat his face is capable of doing.Now, that's great, except we had him at age 44.We need to put another 40 years on him at this point.We brought in Rick Baker,and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurusof our industry.And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji,and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time.And we commissioned them to make a maquette,or a bust, of Benjamin.So, in the spirit of "The Great Unveiling" -- I had to do this --I had to unveil something.So this is Ben 80.We created three of these:there's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60.And this really became the template for moving forward.Now, this was made from a life cast of Brad.So, in fact, anatomically, it is correct.The eyes, the jaw, the teeth:everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has.We have these maquettes scanned into the computerat very high resolution --enormous polygonal count.And so now we had three age increments of Benjaminin the computer.But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.We went through this process, then, called retargeting.This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.And here's the resulting data that comes from that,the model that comes from that.Retargeting is the process of transposing that dataonto another model.And because the life cast, or the bust -- the maquette -- of Benjaminwas made from Brad,we could transpose the data of Brad at 44onto Brad at 87.So now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can doat age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s.Next we had to go into the shooting process.So while all that's going on,we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world.And we shot our body actors,and we shot them wearing blue hoods.So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.And the blue hoods helped us with two things:one, we could easily erase their heads;and we also put tracking markers on their headsso we could recreate the camera motionand the lens optics from the set.But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.And so we edited the footage that was shot on locationwith the rest of the cast and the body actorsand about six months laterwe brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angelesand he watched on the screen.His job, then, was to become Benjamin.And so we looped the scenes.He watched again and again.We encouraged him to improvise.And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual placesthat we didn't think he was going to go.We shot him with four HD camerasso we'd get multiple views of himand then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjaminthat he thought best matched the footagewith the rest of the cast.From there we went into a process called image analysis.And so here, you can see again, the chosen take.And you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87.And so, what's interesting about this iswe used something called image analysis,which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face.And so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow.And the software would tell us that, well,in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here,and it concludes moving in frame 32.And so we could choose numbers of positions on the faceto pull that data from.And then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew --that secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us tomatch the performance footage of Bradin live action with our database of aged Benjamin,the FACS shapes that we had.On a frame-by-frame basis,we could actually reconstruct a 3D headthat exactly matched the performance of Brad.So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.And here you can see the body actor.And then this is what we called the "dead head," no reference to Jerry Garcia.And then here's the reconstructed performancenow with the timings of the performance.And then, again, the final shot.It was a long process.(Applause)The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this,because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides.We had to create a lighting system.So really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environmentfor every single location that Benjamin had to appearso that we could put Ben's head into any sceneand it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actorsin the real world.We also had to create an eye system.We found the old adage, you know,"The eyes are the window to the soul,"absolutely true.So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity,and feel his intent coming through the eyes,then we would succeed.So we had one person focused on the eye systemfor almost two full years.We also had to create a mouth system.We worked from dental molds of Brad.We had to age the teeth over time.We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.He was very popular.Skin displacement: another big deal.The skin had to be absolutely accurate.He's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing homearound other old people,so he had to look exactly the same as the others.So, lots of work on skin deformation,you can see in some of these cases it works,in some cases it looks bad.This is a very, very, very early test in our process.So, effectively we created a digital puppetthat Brad Pitt could operate with his own face.There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavioror enhance his performance.There was something that we encountered, though,that we ended up calling "the digital Botox effect."So, as things went through this process,Fincher would always say, "It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."And thing our process and the technology couldn't do,is they couldn't understand intent,the intent of the actor.So it sees a smile as a smile.It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile,or a frustrated smile.So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.But we ended up calling the entire processand all the technology "emotion capture,"as opposed to just motion capture.Take another look.Brad Pitt: Well, I heard momma and Tizzy whisper,and they said I was gonna die soon,but ... maybe not.EU: That's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes.(Applause)A couple of quick factoids;it really took 155 people over two years,and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut.But, that is Benjamin. Thank you.

Chris Anderson: Let's now see the extraordinary speechthat we captured a couple weeks ago.(Music)Jose Antonio Abreu: My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,I am overjoyed todayat being awarded the TED Prizeon behalf of allthe distinguished music teachers,artists and educators from Venezuelawho have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 yearsin founding, growing and developing in Venezuelathe National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs.Since I was a boy,in my early childhood,I always wanted to be a musician,and, thank God, I made it.From my teachers, my family and my community,I had all the necessary support to become a musician.All my life I've dreamedthat all Venezuelan childrenhave the same opportunity that I had.From that desire and from my heartstemmed the idea to make musica deep and global reality for my country.From the very first rehearsal, I saw the bright future ahead.Because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me.I had received a donation of 50 music standsto be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal.When I arrived at the rehearsal, only 11 kids had shown up,and I said to myself,"Do I close the program or multiply these kids?"I decided to face the challenge, and on that same night,I promised those 11 children I'd turn our orchestrainto one of the leading orchestras in the world.Two months ago, I remembered that promise I made,when a distinguished English criticpublished an article in the London Times,asking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup.He mentioned four great world orchestras,and the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra.Today we can saythat art in Latin Americais no longer a monopoly of elitesand that it has become a social right,a right for all the people.Child: There is no difference here between classes,nor white or black, nor if you have money or not.Simply, if you are talented,if you have the vocation and the will to be here,you get in. You share with us and make music.JA: During the recent tourby the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuelaof U.S. and Europe,we saw how our music moved young audiencesto the bottom of their souls,how children and adolescents rushed up to the stageto receive the jackets from our musicians,how the standing ovations, sometimes 30 minutes long,seemed to last forever,and how the public, after the concert was over,went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph.This meant not only an artistic triumph,but also a profound emotional sympathybetween the public of the most advanced nations of the worldand the musical youth of Latin America,as seen in Venezuela,giving these audiences a message of music, vitality, energy,enthusiasm and strength.In its essence, the orchestra and the choirare much more than artistic structures.They are examples and schools of social life,because to sing and to play togethermeans to intimately coexisttoward perfection and excellence,following a strict discipline of organization and coordinationin order to seek the harmonic interdependenceof voices and instruments.That's how they build a spirit of solidarityand fraternity among them,develop their self-esteemand foster the ethical and aesthetical valuesrelated to the music in all its senses.This is why music is immensely importantin the awakening of sensibility, in the forging of valuesand in the training of youngstersto teach other kids.Child: After all this time here,music is life.Nothing else.Music is life.JA: Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story,and they are all important and of great significance to me.Let me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz.He is a boy from a parish in Caracaswho passionately attended to his double bass lessonsat the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra.With his effort,and the support of his mother, his family and his community,he became a principal memberin the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.We have another well-known case -- Gustavo Dudamel.He started as a boy member of the children's orchestrain his hometown, Barquisimeto.There, he grew as a violinist and as a conductor.He became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras,and today conducts the world's greatest orchestras.He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic,and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras.He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra,and he's an unbeatable examplefor young musicians in Latin America and the world.The structure of El Sistemais based on a new and flexible managing styleadapted to the features of each community and region,and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle classall over Venezuela.It's a program of social rescueand deep cultural transformationdesigned for the whole Venezuelan societywith absolutely no distinctions whatsoever,but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups.The effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles:in the personal/social circle,in the family circle and in the community.In the personal/social circle,the children in the orchestras and choirsdevelop their intellectual and emotional side.The music becomes a sourcefor developing the dimensions of the human being,thus elevating the spiritand leading man to a full development of his personality.So, the emotional and intellectual profits are huge --the acquisition of leadership, teaching and training principles,the sense of commitment, responsibility,generosity and dedication to others,and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals.All this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence.Mother Teresa of Calcuttainsisted on something that always impressed me:the most miserable and tragic thing about povertyis not the lack of bread or roof,but the feeling of being no-one --the feeling of not being anyone,the lack of identification,the lack of public esteem.That's why the child's developmentin the orchestra and the choirprovides him with a noble identityand makes him a role model for his family and community.It makes him a better student at schoolbecause it inspires in him a sense of responsibility,perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school.Within the family, the parents' support is unconditional.The child becomes a role model for both his parents,and this is very important for a poor child.Once the child discovers he is important to his family,he begins to seek new ways of improving himselfand hopes better for himself and his community.Also, he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family.All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic.The large majority of our children belong, as I already mentioned,to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population.That encourages them to embrace new dreams, new goals,and progress in the various opportunitiesthat music has to offer.Finally, in the circle of the community,the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of cultureand sources of exchange and new meanings.The spontaneity music hasexcludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society.It's what makes a child play a violin at home,while his father works in his carpentry.It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home,while her mother does the housework.The idea is that the families join with pride and joyin the activities of the orchestras and the choirsthat their children belong to.The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself,which also lies within itself,ends up overcoming material poverty.From the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument,he's no longer poor.He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level,who'll later become a full citizen.Needless to say that music is the number one preventionagainst prostitution, violence, bad habits,and everything degrading in the life of a child.A few years ago, historian Arnold Toynbeesaid that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis.Not an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one.I believe that to confront such a crisis,only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity,to mankind's deepest aspirations,and to the historic demands of our times.Education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge --is the means to strive for a more perfect, more aware,more noble and more just society.With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TEDfor its outstanding humanism, the scope of its principles,for its open and generous promotion of young values.We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental wayto the building of this new era in the teaching of music,in which the social, communal, spiritual and vindicatory aimsof the child and the adolescentbecome a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission.No longer putting society at the service of art,and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite,but instead art at the service of society,at the service of the weakest, at the service of the children,at the service of the sick, at the service of the vulnerable,and at the service of all those who cry for vindicationthrough the spirit of their human conditionand the raising up of their dignity.(Music)(Applause)CA: We are going live now to Caracas.We are going live to Caracasto hear Maestro Abreu's TED Prize wish.JA: Here is my TED Prize wish:I wish that you'll help to create and documenta special training programfor 50 gifted young musicians,passionate about their art and social justice,and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United Statesand other countries.Thank you very much.(Applause)

I am a writer.in my life and in my career,this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love"people treat me like I'm doomed.Seriously -- doomed, doomed!ever again?"So that's reassuring, you know.and nothing's ever going to come of it(Laughter)Like that, you know.Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.And I always have been.that people can't even guess at,But, when it comes to writing,is why?You know, is it rational?for being alcoholic manic-depressives.(Laughter)is are you guys all cool with that idea?Are you comfortable with that?I think it's odious.And I also think it's dangerous,of assumption,Which is -- you know, like check it out,So Jesus, what a thought!and I don't want to go there.(Laughter)And so, the question becomes, how?for models for how to do that,I've been sort of looking across time,about how to help creative peopleBut, ancient Greece and ancient Rome --came from human beings back then, OK?for distant and unknowable reasons.who spoke wisdom to him from afar.The Romans had the same idea,kind of like Dobby the house elf,and who would come outand would shape the outcome of that work.(Laughter)for a really long time.above all gods and mysteries,who take dictation from the divine.And for the first time in history,rather than having a genius.And I think the pressure of thatAnd, if this is true,and I think it is true,the question becomes, what now?Can we do this differently?Maybe not.in one 18 minute speech.about the notion of, basically, fairiesyou know, why not?Why not think about it this way?of the creative process.knows does not always behave rationally.I had this encounter recentlyshe would be out working in the fields,coming at her from over the landscape.And she would run like hell to the houseand grab it on the page.looking, as she put it "for another poet."And then there were these times --this is the piece I never forgot --and the poem passes through her,and she would catch it.She would catch the poem by its tail,as she was transcribing on the page.(Laughter)(Laughter)But even I, in my mulishness,that I honestly cannot identify.And what is that thing?but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?is the musician Tom Waits,And we were talking about this,trying to control and manage and dominatethat were totally internalized.But then he got older, he got calmer,and this is when it all changed for him.he hears this little fragment of melody,and he wants it, it's gorgeous,like, "I'm going to lose this thing,I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."And instead of panicking, he just stopped.He just looked up at the sky, and he said,(Laughter)when I can take care of you.Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.Go bother Leonard Cohen."that was not quite Tom.and I tried it.And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing,that is not entirely my fault, right?I don't have any more than this.that I showed up for my part of the job."(Laughter)Because --(Applause)Because in the end it's like this, OK --and they were terrific, right?a performance like this.It was like time would stop,and he wasn't doing anything differentbut everything would align.and all lit up on fire with divinity.And when this happened, back then,"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."That's God, you know.Curious historical footnote:Which is great, because we need that.This is hard.in a creative life.to be passed along when you're finished,with somebody else.This is how I've started to think,to my freakish success.Don't be daunted. Just do your job.If your job is to dance, do your dance.through your efforts, then "Olé!"And if not, do your dance anyhow.And "Olé!" to you, nonetheless."Olé!" to you, nonetheless,to keep showing up.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)June Cohen: Olé!(Applause)

Natalie MacMaster: I'm going to justquickly start out witha little bit of music here. (Applause)(Music)(Applause)Thank you! (Applause)I took my shoes off to dance,but maybe I'll get at that later.Anyways, I... where to start?Well, I'm really excitedto talk a bit aboutmy own upbringing in musicand family and all of that,but I'm even more excited for you peopleto hear about Donnell's amazing familyand maybe even a little bit abouthow we met,and all that sort of thing,but for those of you that may notbe familiar with my upbringing,I'm from Cape Breton Island,Nova Scotia, eastern Canada,which is a very, very musical island,and its origins come from Scotlandwith the music and all the traditions,the dancing, the language,which unfortunately is dying outin Cape Breton.The traditional language is Gaelic,but a lot of the music camefrom the Gaelic language,and the dancing and the singingand everything, and my bloodlineis Scottish through and through,but my mother and fatherare two very, very musical people.My mom taught me to dancewhen I was five, and my dadtaught me to play fiddle when I was nine.My uncle is a very well-knownCape Breton fiddler.His name's Buddy MacMaster,and just a wonderful guy,and we have a great tradition at homecalled square dancing,and we had parties, great partiesat our house and the neighbors' houses,and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs.Well, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party,but kitchen partyin Cape Breton is very common,and basically somebody drops into the house,and no matter what house you go toin Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there,guaranteed, and I'd say,well there's first of all more fiddlersper capita in Cape Breton than anywherein the world, so ten chances to one,the fellow who walked in the doorcould play it, so you'd have someone comeinto the house, you'd invite them to playa tune, and lo and beholda little party would start up and somebody would dance,and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing,so it was a wonderful, wonderful wayto grow up, and that is wheremy beginnings in music come from:my surroundings, my family,just my bloodline in itself, and, oh,I've done lots of things with my music.I've recorded lots of CDs.I was nominated for a Grammy andI've won some awards and stuff like that,so that's awesome,but the best part was meeting my husband,and I've actually known Donnellfor probably 12 years now, andI'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess,how music brought us together,but I'm going to introduce youright now to my new husbandas of October 5,Donnell Leahy. (Applause)(Applause)Donnell Leahy: Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TEDexperience and I'm glad to be here,but I'm just trying to put it all together,trying to figure all you people out, and I'vebeen here for a short while, and I'm startingto understand a little bit better.So I asked Natalie, what do I do?And she said, just talk about yourself.It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a littlebit about my family. I'm one of 11 brothersand sisters from Lakefield, Ontario,an hour and a half northeast of Toronto,and we grew up on a farm.Mom and Dad raised beef cattle,and I'm the oldest boy.There are four girls a little bit older than me.We grew up without a television.People find that strange,but I think it was a great blessing for us.We had a television for a few years,but of course we wasted so much timeand the work wasn't getting done,so out went the television.We grew up playing—Mom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally.Mom and Natalie's motherknew each other. We grew up playing,and used to dance together, right, yeah.(Laughter) We grew up playing a bunch of,we played by ear and I thinkthat's important for us becausewe were not really exposed to a lot ofdifferent styles of music.We learned to play the instruments,but we kind of had to come from withinor go from within, because we didn'twatch television, we didn't listen to a lot ofradio. We went to churchand to school sometimes,and farmed and played music,so we were able, I think,at a very critical age to developour own style, our own self,and my mother plays, my father plays,and the style that camefrom the Ottawa Valley in Ontario,we call it French-Canadian stylebut it originated in logging camps.Years ago, hundreds of men would goup for the winter to the campsin Northern Ontario and in Quebec,and they were all different cultures,and the Irish, the French, Scottish,German, they'd all meet, and of courseat night, they'd play cardsand step dance and play fiddles,and over the course of many years,the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolvedand the Ottawa Valley step dancingevolved, so that's, I kind of started outwith that style and I quicklystarted doing my own thing,and then I met Natalie, and I wasexposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling.That's how we met. (Laughter)You tell them. (Laughter)NM: You want to or no? (Laughter)Well I guess I have to now.Well, it's just so interesting thatDonnell's upbringing was very similarto mine, and I actually saw Donnell playwhen I was about 12 years old,and he and his family came toInverness, which is about 45 minutesfrom where I lived, and I was justblown away, like, it was just amazing,and you'll find out why pretty soon here,but I couldn't believe the fiddlingand Mom was there with me,and she was saying —Donnell's mother came up on stageand danced with her children, and Momwas saying, "That's Julie MacDonnell,I used to dance with her when wewere kids. Little did I think our childrenwould be playing instruments, you know,playing music, yeah."Twelve years, er, 20 years later little did she thinkher kids would be getting married,but anyway, so, then I gota phone call about, I dunno,seven years later. I was 19,first or second year of college,and it was Donnell, andhe said "Hi, you probably don't know mebut my name is Donnell Leahy."And I said, "I know you.I have a tape of yours at home."And he said, "Well, I'm in Truro,"which is where I was,and he asked me out for supper.That's it. (Laughter)(Applause)Then — Will I keep going? (Laughs)(Laughter)Then we dated for two years,broke up for 10, got back togetherand got married. (Laughter) (Applause)DL: So anyway, we're running out of time,so I'll just get to it.I'm going to play a piece of music for you.It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen.I starts out with a slow air.Airs were played in Europeat burials, as a body was carried outfrom the wake site to the burial site,the procession was led by a piperor a fiddle player.I'll quickly play a short part of the air,and then I'm going to get intokind of a crazy tune that is very difficultto play when you're not warmed up,so, if I mess it up, pretend you like itanyway. It's called The Banks.(Tuning)(Laughter)(Music)(Applause)NM: Well, we're gonna play onetogether now. (Applause)We're laughing, like, becauseour styles are totally different,as you can hear.And so, you know, Donnell and Iare actually in the process ofwriting new pieces of music togetherthat we can play,but we don't have any of those ready.We just started yesterday. (Laughter)So we're gonna play something together anyway.DL: With one minute.NM: With one minute.(Audience reaction)DL: You start. NM: No, you have to start,because you've got to do your thing.(Music)NM: I'm not tuned. Hold on.(Tuning)NM: I feel like I'm in the duck orthe bird pose right now. (Laughter)(Music)(Audience claps along)(Applause)Announcer: Great news,they're running late downstairs.We've got another 10 minutes.(Applause)NM: Okay. Sure.All right, okay.Let's get her going. (Applause)(Tuning)DL: What do you want to play?NM: Well, um...(Music) (Laughter)NM: Uh, sure.DL: How fast?NM: Not too fast.(Music)(Audience claps along)(Cheering)(Audience claps along)(Music)(Applause)DL: We're going to play a tuneand Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano.The Cape Breton piano playingis just awesome. It's very rhythmicand, you'll see it.My mom plays piano, and she learnedto play before they had a piano at homein Cape Breton. Before Mom's family hada piano in Cape Breton, she learned to playthe rhythms on a piece of board,and the fiddlers would all congregateto play on the cold winter's eveningsand Mom would be banging on this board,so when they bought a piano,they bought it in Toronto and had it takenby train and brought in on a horse,a horse and sleigh to the house.It became the only piano in the region,and Mom said she could basically playas soon as the piano arrived,she could play it because she had learnedall these rhythms. Anyway, we foundthe piano last year and were able tobring it back home. We purchased it.It had gone through, like,five or six families,and it was just a big thing for us,and we found actually an old pictureof somebody and their family years ago.Anyway, I'm blabbering on here.NM: No, I want you to tell them about Leahy.DL: What about Leahy? (Laughter)NM: Just tell them what—DL: She wants me to talk about—We have a band named Leahy.There's 11 siblings. We, um—What will I tell them? (Laughter)We opened—NM: No surgeries.DL: No surgeries, oh yeah.We had a great opportunity.We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour.It was a big thing for us, and nowall my sisters are off having babiesand the boys are all getting married, so we'restaying close to home for, I guess,another couple of weeks.What can I say? I don't know what to say,Natalie. We, uh... (Laughter)(Laughter)NM: Is this what marriage is about?(Applause)I like it. (Applause)(Laughter)DL: Oh yeah, okay,in my family we had seven girls, four boys,we had two fiddles and one piano,and of course we were all fighting to playon the instruments, so dad and momset a rule that you couldn't kick anyoneoff the instrument. You had to waituntil they were finished, so of course,what we would do is we'd get on the pianoand you wouldn't even get off to eat,because you wouldn't want to give it upto your brother or sister, and they'd waitand wait and wait, and it'd be midnightand you'd be still sitting there on the piano,but it was their way to get us to practice.Will we play a tune?NM: It worked. DL: It worked.Sorry, I hate to carry on...So this is our last number, and we'll feature Nat on piano.Okay, play in, how about A?(Music)(Applause)

My work is play.And I play when I design.I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make surethat I actually do that,and the definition of play,number one, was engaging in a childlikeactivity or endeavor,and number two was gambling.And I realize I do bothwhen I'm designing.I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time.And I think that if you're not,there's probably something inherently wrongwith the structure or the situation you're in,if you're a designer.But the serious part is what threw me,and I couldn't quite get a handleon it until I remembered an essay.And it's an essay I read 30 years ago.It was written by Russell Baker,who used to write an "Observer" column in the New York Times.He's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read youthis essay,or an excerpt from itbecause it really hit home for me.Here is a letter of friendly advice.Be serious, it says.What it means, of course, is, be solemn.Being solemn is easy.Being serious is hard.Children almost always begin by being serious,which is what makes them so entertainingwhen compared with adults as a class.Adults, on the whole, are solemn.In politics, the rare candidate who is serious,like Adlai Stevenson,is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn, like Eisenhower.That's because it is hard for most peopleto recognize seriousness, which is rare,but more comfortable to endorse solemnity,which is commonplace.Jogging, which is commonplace,and widely accepted as good for you, is solemn.Poker is serious.Washington, D.C. is solemn.New York is serious.Going to educational conferences to tell you anythingabout the future is solemn.Taking a long walk by yourself,during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's,is serious.(Laughter)Now, when I apply Russell Baker's definitionof solemnity or seriousness to design,it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality.Solemn design is often important and very effective design.Solemn design is also socially correct,and is accepted by appropriate audiences.It's what right-thinking designersand all the clients are striving for.Serious design, serious play,is something else.For one thing, it often happensspontaneously, intuitively,accidentally or incidentally.It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance,or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness.But mostly, it's achieved through all those kind of crazyparts of human behavior thatdon't really make any sense.Serious design is imperfect.It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something beingthe first of its kind.Serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessfulfrom the solemn point of view.That's because the art of serious playis about invention, change, rebellion -- not perfection.Perfection happens during solemn play.Now, I always saw design careerslike surreal staircases.If you look at the staircase, you'll seethat in your 20s the risers are very highand the steps are very short,and you make huge discoveries.You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth.That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn,and so that anything you do is a learning experienceand you're just jumping right up there.As you get older, the risers get shallowerand the steps get wider,and you start moving along at a slower pacebecause you're making fewer discoveries.And as you get older and more decrepit,you sort of inch along on thissort of depressing, long staircase,leading you into oblivion.(Laughter)I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious.I'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and morethat I'm solemn when I don't have to be.And in my 35 years of working experience,I think I was really serious four times.And I'm going to show them to you now,because they came out of very specific conditions.It's great to be a kid.Now, when I was in my early 20s,I worked in the record business, designing record covers for CBS Records,and I had no idea what a great job I had.I thought everybody had a job like that.And what --the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was,what was going on around meand the things that came at the time I walked into designwere the enemy.I really, really, really hatedthe typeface Helvetica.I thought the typeface Helveticawas the cleanest, most boring, most fascistic,really repressive typeface,and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica.And when I was inmy college days,this was the sort of designthat was fashionable and popular.This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak,but I just hated it, because it was designed with Helvetica,and I made parodies about it.I just thought it was, you know, completely boring.(Laughter)So -- so, my goal in lifewas to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica.And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helveticawas actually kind of hard because you had to find it.And there weren't a lot of books about the history of designin the early 70s. There weren't --there wasn't a plethora of design publishing.You actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe.You had to go places and find the stuff.And what I responded to was, you know,Art Nouveau, or deco,or Victorian typography,or things that were just completely not Helvetica.And I taught myself design this way,and this was sort of my early years,and I used these thingsin really goofy wayson record covers and in my design.I wasn't educated. I just sort ofput these things together.I mixed up Victorian designs with pop,and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else.And I made these very lush,very elaborate record covers,not because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist --because I didn't know what those things were.I just hated Helvetica.(Laughter)And that kind of passiondrove me into very serious play,a kind of play I could never do nowbecause I'm too well-educated.And there's something wonderful aboutthat form of youth,where you can let yourselfgrow and play, and bereally a brat, and then accomplish things.By the end of the '70s, actually,the stuff became known.I mean, these covers appeared all over the world,and they started winning awards,and people knew them.And I was suddenly a post-modernist,and I began a career as -- in my own business.And first I was praised for it, then criticized for it,but the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn.I didn't do what I thinkwas a piece of serious work again for about 14 years.I spent most of the '80s being quite solemn,turning out these sorts of designsthat I was expected to dobecause that's who I was,and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemnto hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again.So, here was the second conditionfor which I think I accomplished some serious play.There's a Paul Newman moviethat I love called "The Verdict."I don't know how many of you have seen it, but it's a beaut.And in the movie, he playsa down-and-out lawyerwho's become an ambulance chaser.And he's taken on --he's given, actually -- a malpractice suit to handlethat's sort of an easy deal,and in the midst of trying to connect the deal,he starts to empathizeand identify with his client,and he regains his morality and purpose,and he goes on to win the case.And in the depth of despair,in the midst of the movie, when it looks like he can't pull this thing off,and he needs this case,he needs to win this case so badly.There's a shot of Paul Newman alone,in his office, saying,"This is the case. There are no other cases.This is the case. There are no other cases."And in that moment ofdesire and focus,he can win.And that is a wonderfulposition to be in to create some serious play.And I had that moment in 1994when I met a theater directornamed George Wolfe,who was going to have me designan identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival,then known,and then became the Public Theater.And I began getting immersedin this projectin a way I never was before.This is what theater advertising looked like at that time.This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times.So, this is sort of a comment on the time.And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this.They had no logo and no identity,but they had these very iconic posterspainted by Paul Davis.And George Wolf had taken over from another directorand he wanted to change the theater,and he wanted to make it urban and loudand a place that was inclusive.So, drawing on my love of typography,I immersed myself into this project.And what was different about it was the totality of it,was that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a placein a way I had never done before,where every aspect --the smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was --was designed by me.There was no format.There was no in-house department that these things were pushed to.I literally for three years made everything --every scrap of paper, everything online,that this theater did.And it was the only job,even though I was doing other jobs.I lived and breathed it in a way I haven'twith a client since.It enabled me to really express myself and grow.And I think that you knowwhen you're going to be given this position,and it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity,it's the moment of serious play.I did these things, and I still do them.I still work for the Public Theater.I'm on their board, andI still am involved with it.The high point of the Public Theater, I think, was in 1996,two years after I designed it,which was the "Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk" campaignthat was all over New York.But something happened to it, and what happened to it was,it became very popular.And that is a kiss of death for something seriousbecause it makes it solemn.And what happened wasthat New York City, to a degree,ate my identitybecause people began to copy it.Here's an ad in the New York Timessomebody did for a play called "Mind Games."Then "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics,and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away,which meant I had to change it.So, I changed it so that every season was different,and I continued to do these posters,but they never had the seriousnessof the first identitybecause they were too individual, and they didn't have that heftof everything being the same thing.Now -- and I think since the Public Theater,I must have done more than a dozencultural identities for major institutions,and I don't think I ever -- I evergrasped that seriousness again --I do them for very big, important institutionsin New York City.The institutions are solemn,and so is the design.They're better crafted than the Public Theater was,and they spend more money on them, but I thinkthat that moment comes and goes.The best way to accomplish serious design --which I think we all have the opportunity to do --is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.That doesn't happen very often,but it happened to me in the year 2000,when for some reason or another,a whole pile of different architectsstarted to ask me to designthe insides of theaters with them,where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.I'd never done this kind of work before.I didn't know how to read an architectural plan,I didn't know what they were talking about,and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job --a single job -- could go on for four yearsbecause I was used to immediacy in graphic design,and that kind of attention to detailwas really bad for somebody like me, with ADD.So, it was a rough -- it was a rough go,but I fell in love with this processof actually integrating graphics into architecturebecause I didn't know what I was doing.I said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?"New Yorkers look at their feet.And then I found that actors and actressesactually take their cues from the floor,so it turned out that these sorts of sign systemsbegan to make sense.They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways.They ran around corners,they went up sides of buildings,and they melded into the architecture.This is Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway,and the type is interwoven into the stainless steeland backlit with fiber optics.And the architect, Jim Polshek,essentially gave me a canvasto play typography out on.And it was serious play.This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,made out of completely inexpensive materials.Extruded typography that's backlit with neon.Things I never did before, built before.I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do.Donors' walls made out of Lucite.And then, inexpensive signage.(Laughter)I think my favorite of thesewas this little job in Newark, New Jersey.It's a performing arts school.This is the building that -- they had no money,and they had to recast it, and they said,if we give you 100,000 dollars, what can you do with it?And I did a little Photoshop job on it, and I said,Well, I think we can paint it.And we did. And it was play.And there's the building. Everything was painted --typography over the whole damn thing,including the air conditioning ducts.I hired guys who paint flatsfixed on the sides of garagesto do the painting on the building, and they loved it.They got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously.They used to climb up on the building and call meand tell me that they had to correct my typography --that my spacing was wrong, and they moved it,and they did wonderful things with it.They were pretty serious, too. It was quite wonderful.By the time I did Bloomberg's headquartersmy work had begun to become accepted.People wanted it in big, expensive places.And that began to make it solemn.Bloomberg was all about numbers,and we did big numbers through the spaceand the numbers were projected on a spectacular LEDthat my partner, Lisa Strausfeld, programmed.But it became the endof the seriousness of the play,and it started to, once again, become solemn.This is a current projectin Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,where I got to be goofy.I was invited to designa logo for this neighborhood, called the North Side,and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo.I think that's rather creepy, actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo?A neighborhood has a thing -- it's got a landmark, it's got a place,it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean, what would that be?So I had to actually give a presentationto a city counciland neighborhood constituents,and I went to Pittsburgh and I said,"You know, really what you have hereare all these underpassesthat separate the neighborhood from the center of town.Why don't you celebrate them, and make the underpasses landmarks?"So I began doing this crazy presentationof these installations --potential installations -- onthese underpass bridges,and stood up in front of the city council --and was a little bit scared,I have to admit.But I was so utterly unqualified for this project,and so utterly ridiculous,and ignored the brief so desperatelythat I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness,just completely because it was so goofy to begin with.And this is the bridge they're actuallypainting up and preparing as we speak.It will change every six months, and it will become an art installationin the North Side of Pittsburgh,and it will probably become a landmark in the area.John Hockenberry told you a bit aboutmy travail with Citibank,that is now a 10-year relationship, and I still work with them.And I actually am amused by them and like them,and think that as a very, very, very, very, very big corporationthey actually keep their graphics very nice.I drew the logo for Citibankon a napkin in the first meeting.That was the play part of the job.And then I spent a yeargoing to long, tedious,boring meetings,trying to sell this logo throughto a huge corporationto the point of tears.I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year.We made idiotic presentationsshowing how the Citi logo made sense,and how it was really derived from an umbrella,and we made animations of these things,and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.And it was worth it, because they bought this thing,and it played out on such a grand scale,and it's so internationally recognizable,but for me it was actually a very, very depressing year.As a matter of fact, they actually never bought onto the logountil Fallon put it onits very good "Live Richly" campaign,and then everybody accepted it all over the world.So during this time I neededsome kind of counterbalancefor this crazy, crazy existenceof going to these long, idiotic meetings.And I was up in my country house,and for some reason, I began paintingthese very big, very involved,laborious, complicatedmaps of the entire world,and listing every place on the planet, and putting them in,and misspelling them, and putting things in the wrong spot,and completely controlling the information,and going totally and completely nuts with it.They would take me about six months initially,but then I started getting faster at it.Here's the United States.Every single city of the United States is on here.And it hung for about eight monthsat the Cooper-Hewitt, and people walked up to it,and they would point to a part of the mapand they'd say, "Oh, I've been here."And, of course, they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot.(Laughter)But what I liked about it was,I was controlling my own idiotic information,and I was creating my own palette of information,and I was totally and completelyat play.One of my favorites wasthis painting I did of Florida after the 2000 electionthat has the election results rolling around in the water.I keep that for evidence.(Laughter)Somebodywas up at my house and saw the paintingsand recommended them to a gallery,and I had a first showabout two-and-a-half years ago, and I showed these paintingsthat I'm showing you now.And then a funny thing happened -- they sold.And they sold quickly,and became rather popular.We started making prints from them.This is Manhattan, one from the series.This is a print from the United States which we did in red, white and blue.We began doing these big silkscreen prints,and they started selling, too.So, the gallery wanted me to have another showin two years,which meant that I reallyhad to paint these paintingsmuch fasterthan I had ever done them. And I --they started to become more political, and I picked areasthat sort of were in the newsor that I had some feeling about,and I began doing these things.And then this funny thing happened.I found that I was no longer at play.I was actually in this solemn landscapeof fulfilling an expectationfor a show,which is not where I started with these things.So, while they became successful,I know how to make them,so I'm not a neophyte,and they're no longer serious --they have become solemn.And that's a terrifying factor --when you start something and it turns that way --because it means that all that's left for youis to go back and to find outwhat the next thing is that you can push,that you can invent, that you can be ignorant about,that you can be arrogant about,that you can fail with,and that you can be a fool with.Because in the end, that's how you grow,and that's all that matters.So, I'm plugging along here --(Laughter)and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase.Thank you very much.

Of the five senses,vision is the one that I appreciate the most,and it's the one that I can least take for granted.I think this is partially due to my father, who was blind.It was a fact that he didn't make much of a fuss about, usually.One time in Nova Scotia,when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun --yeah, same one as in the Carly Simon song,which may or may not referto James Taylor, Warren Beatty or Mick Jagger; we're not really sure.They handed out these dark plastic viewersthat allowed us to look directly at the sunwithout damaging our eyes.But Dad got really scared:he didn't want us doing that.He wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewersso that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged.I thought this was a little strange at the time.What I didn't know at the timewas that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight.When he and his sister Martha were just very little,their mom took them out to see a total eclipse --or actually, a solar eclipse --and not long after that,both of them started losing their eyesight.Decades later,it turned out that the source of their blindnesswas most likely some sort of bacterial infection.As near as we can tell,it had nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse,but by then my grandmother had already gone to her gravethinking it was her fault.So, Dad graduated Harvard in 1946,married my mom,and bought a house in Lexington, Massachusetts,where the first shots were fired against the British in 1775,although we didn't actually hit any of them until Concord.He got a job working for Raytheon,designing guidance systems,which was part of the Route 128 high-tech axis in those days --so the equivalent of Silicone Valley in the '70s.Dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy;he just really felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War IIon account of his handicap,although they did let him get throughthe several-hour-long army physical exambefore they got to the very last test,which was for vision.(Laughter)So, Dad started racking up all of these patentsand gaining a reputation as a blind genius, rocket scientist, inventor.But to us he was just Dad,and our home life was pretty normal.As a kid, I watched a lot of televisionand had lots of nerdy hobbieslike mineralogy and microbiology and the space programand a little bit of politics.I played a lot of chess.But at the age of 14,a friend of mine got me interested in comic books,and I decided that was what I wanted to do for a living.So, here's my dad:he's a scientist, he's an engineer and he's a military contractor.So, he has four kids, right?One grows up to become a computer scientist,one grows up to join the Navy,one grows up to become an engineer,and then there's me:the comic book artist.(Laughter)Which, incidentally, makes me the opposite of Dean Kamen,because I'm a comic book artist, son of an inventor,and he's an inventor, son of a comic book artist.(Laughter)Right, it's true.(Applause)The funny thing is, Dad had a lot of faith in me.He had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist,even though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever:everything he saw was just a blur.Now, this gives a real meaning to the term "blind faith,"which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people.Now, faith in things which cannot be seen, which cannot be proved,is not the sort of faith that I've ever really related to all that much.I tend to like science,where what we seeand can ascertain are the foundation of what we know.But there's a middle ground, too.A middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage,and his steam-driven computers that were never built.Nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind,except for Ada Lovelace,and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream.Vannevar Bush with his Memex --this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips --he had this vision.And I think a lot of people in his dayprobably thought he was a bit of a kook.And, yeah, we can look back in retrospect and say,yeah, ha-ha, you know -- it's all microfilm. But that's --that's not the point. He understood the shape of the future.So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction.Same thing: he understood the shape of the future,even though it was something that wouldonly be implemented by people much later.Or Paul Baran, and his vision for packet switching.Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.Or even the people who actually pulled it off,the people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston,who just would sketch out these structuresof what would eventually become a worldwide network,and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papersand arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's --on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts,just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferredand listening to Gladys Knight &amp; the Pipssinging "Midnight Train to Georgia," while --(Laughter)-- in my dad's big easy chair, you know?So, three types of vision, right?Vision based on what one cannot see:the vision of that unseen and unknowable.The vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained.And this third kindof vision, of something whichcan be, which may be,based on knowledge, but is as yet unproven.Now, we've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science,but I think it's also true in the arts, it's true in politics,it's even true in personal endeavors.What it comes down to, really, is four basic principles:learn from everyone,follow no one,watch for patterns,and work like hell.I think these are the four principles that go into this.And it's that third one, especially,where visions of the futurebegin to manifest themselves.What's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world,is, I think, only one of four different waysthat manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor.In comics, I know thatit results in sort of a formalist attitudetowards trying to understand how it works.Then there's another, more classical, attitudewhich embraces beauty and craft.Another one which believes in the pure transparency of content.And then anotherwhich emphasizes the authenticity of human experience --and honesty, and rawness.These are four very different ways of looking at the world. I even gave them names.The classicist, the animist, and formalist and iconoclast.Interestingly, it seemed to correspond more or lessto Jung's four subdivisions of human thought.And they reflect a dichotomy of art and delighton left and the right;tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom.And if you go on the diagonal, you get content and form --and then beauty and truth.And it probably applies just as muchto music and to movies and to fine art,which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all,or for that matter, nothing to do with our conference theme of"Inspired by Nature" --except to the extent of the fable of the frogwho gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the riverbecause the scorpion promises not to sting him,but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die,but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says,"Because it's my nature" --in that sense, yes.(Laughter)So --so this was my nature. The thing was, I sawthat the route that I took to discoveringthis focus in my workand who I was,I saw it as just this road to discovery.Actually, it was just me embracing my nature,which meansthat I didn't actually fall that far from the tree after all.So what does a "scientific mind"do in the arts?Well, I started making comics,but I also started trying to understand them, almost immediately.And one of the most important things about comics, I discovered,was that comics are a visual medium,but they try to embrace all of the senses within it.So, the different elements of comics, like pictures and words,and the different symbols and everything in betweenthat comics presentsare all funneled through the single conduit of vision.So you have things like resemblance,where something which resembles the physical world can be abstractedin a couple of different directions:abstracted from resemblance,but still retaining the complete meaning,or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan.Put all these three together, and you have a nice little mapof the entire boundary of visual iconographywhich comics can embrace.And if you move to the right you also get language,because that's abstracting even further from resemblance,but still maintaining meaning.Vision is called upon to represent soundand to understand the common properties of those twoand their common heritage, as well.Also, to try to represent the texture of soundto capture its essential character through visuals.And there's also a balancebetween the visible and the invisible in comics.Comics is a kind of call and responsein which the artist gives yousomething to see within the panels,and then gives you something to imagine between the panels.Also, another sensewhich comics' vision represents, and that's time.Sequence is a very important aspect of comics.Comics presents a kind of temporal map.And this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics,but I was wondering if perhaps it also energizesother sorts of forms,and I found some in history.And you can see this same principle operatingin these ancient versions of the same idea.What's happening is, the art form is collidingwith the given technology,whether it's paint on stone, like the Tomb of the Scribe in ancient Egypt,or a bas-relief sculpture rising up a stone column,or a 200-foot-long embroidery,or painted deerskin and tree barkrunning across 88 accordion-folded pages.What's interesting is, once you hit print --and this is from 1450, by the way --all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves:rectilinear panel arrangements,simple line drawings without toneand a left-to-right reading sequence.And within 100 years,you already start to see word balloons and captions,and it's really just a hop, skip and a jump from here to here.So I wrote a book about this in '93,but as I was finishing the book,I had to do a little bit of typesetting,and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it,so I bought a computer.And it was just a little thing -- it wasn't good for much except text entry --but my father had told me about Moore's Law,about Moore's Law back in the '70s, and I knew what was coming.And so, I kept my eyes peeledto see if the sort of changes that happenedwhen we went from pre-print comics to print comicswould happen when we went beyond, to post-print comics.So, one of the first things that were proposedwas that we could mix the visuals of comicswith the sound, motion and interactivityof the CD-ROMs that were being made in those days.This was even before the Web.And one of the first things they did was,they tried to take the comics page as-isand transplant it to monitors,which was a classic McLuhanesque mistakeof appropriating the shape of the previous technologyas the content of the new technology.And so, what they would do is,they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages,and they would introduce all this sound and motion.The problem was, that if you go with this idea --this basic idea that space equals time in comics --what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion,which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time,then they break with that continuity of presentation.Interactivity was another thing.There were hypertext comics.But the thing about hypertextis that everything in hypertext is either here, not here or connected to here;it's profoundly non-spatial.The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny,the Penny Marshall to the Marshall Planto "Plan 9" to nine lives:it's all the same.(Laughter)And -- but in comics, in comics,every aspect of the work, every element of the workhas a spatial relationship to every other element at all times.So the question was:was there any way to preserve that spatial relationshipwhile still taking advantage of all of the thingsthat digital had to offer us?And I found my personal answer for thisin those ancient comics that I was showing you.Each of them has a single unbroken reading line,whether it's going zigzag across the wallsor spiraling up a columnor just straight left to right, or even going in a backwards zigzagacross those 88 accordion-folded pages.The same thing is happening, and that is that the basic ideathat as you move through space you move through timeis being carried out without any compromise,but there were compromises when print hit.Adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments,so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and againand again and again.And I thought, O.K., well,if that's true, is there any way,when we go beyond today's print,to somehow bring that back?Now, the monitoris just as limited as the page, technically, right?It's a different shape, but other than thatit's the same basic limitation.But that's only if you look at the monitor as a page,but not if you look at the monitor as a window.And that's what I proposed: that perhaps we could create these comicson an infinite canvas:along the X axis and the Y axis and staircases.We could do circular narratives that were literally circular.We could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn.Parallel narratives could be literally parallel.X, Y and also Z.So I had all these notions. This was back in the late '90s,and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy,but a lot of people then went on and actually did it.I'm going to show you a couple now.This was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jason Lex.And notice what's going on here.What I'm searching for is a durable mutation --that's what all of us are searching for.As media head into this new era,we are looking for mutationsthat are durable, that have some sort of staying power.Now, we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium,and then we're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end.That's that entire comic you just sawis up on the screen right now.But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time,that's just where the technology is right now.As the technology evolves,as you get full immersive displays and whatnot,this sort of thing will only grow.It will adapt. It willadapt to its environment:it's a durable mutation.Here's another one I'll show you. This is by Drew Weing;this is called,"Pup Contemplates the Heat Death of the Universe."See what's going on hereas we draw these stories on an infinite canvasis you're creating a more pure expressionof what this medium is all about.We'll go by this a little quickly -- you get the idea.I just want to get to the last panel.(Laughter)There we go.(Laughter)(Laughter)Just one more.Talk about your infinite canvas.It's by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey in Britain.Why is this important?I think this is important because media,all media,provide us a window back into our world.Now, it could be that motion pictures --and eventually, virtual reality, or something equivalent to it --some sort of immersive display,is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we're in.That's why most people turn to storytelling, is to escape.But media provides us with a windowback into the world that we live in.And when media evolveso that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique.Because what you're looking at is, you're looking at comics cubed:you're looking at comics that are more comics-like than they've ever been before.When that happens, you provide people with multiple waysof re-entering the world through different windows,and when you do that, it allows them to triangulate the world that they live inand see its shape.And that's why I think this is important.One of many reasons, but I've got to go now.Thank you for having me.

I'm just going to play a brief video clip.Video:On the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was soldfor 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record.The buyerwas Kip Forbes,son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century.The original owner of the bottle turned out to beone of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century.Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world,the prince of any wine cellar.Benjamin Wallace: Now, that's about all the videotape that remains of an eventthat set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world.And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock.In 1985, he announced to his friends in the wine worldthat he had made this incredible discovery.Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall,and happened upon this hidden cache of wines --apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles,and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.The mystery persisted for about 20 years.It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles,and he became suspicious.And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBIand ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this.There's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man,and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes.But for those 20 years,an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figuresin the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles.I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of winein the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world,must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.I became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question ofyou know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money,not only on wine but on lots of things,and are they living a better life than me?So, I decided to embark on a quest.With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes,I decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted itemin about a dozen categories,(Laughter)This was the first one.A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.It may come from Wagyu cattle,but it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe,and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.I went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.And it arrived, and it was tiny.And I was outraged.It was like, 160 dollars for this?And then I took a bite,and I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak.I almost couldn't finish it.I was really happy when I was done.(Laughter)Now, the photographer who took the pictures for this projectfor some reason posed his dog in a lot of them,so that's why you're going to see this recurring character.Which, I guess, you know, communicates to youthat I did not think that one was really worth the price.White truffles.One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world.To try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurantin Manhattan -- Del Posto.The waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knoband his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know,"Would Signore like the truffles?"And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma.It's not in their taste, really. It's not in their texture.It's in the smell.These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles,this haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up.10 seconds passed and it was gone.And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that,you know, their purpose had been served,and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me.There were several -- several of these items were disappointments.(Laughter)Yeah.The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there.(Laughter)They did give me a tour, though.And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.It has 360-degree views.It has four balconies.It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from.When I took the tour, it actually included some Opus One, I was glad to see.30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel.This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles,which have antibacterial properties.I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this.And it, you know, tickled a little bit and it smelled good,but I have to say that nobody herehas complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today.(Laughter)But then again, nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing.These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you,not only did I not get a compliment from any of you,I have not gotten a compliment from anybodyin the months that I have owned and worn these.I don't think that whether or not you're getting a complimentshould be the test of something's value,but I think in the case of a fashion item, an article of clothing,that's a reasonable benchmark.That said, a lot of work goes into these.They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cottonthat has been shuttle loomedand then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times.But no compliments.(Laughter)Thank you.Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oilfrom an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany.And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light.He uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted,he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it,he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online,so you can go online and look at your batch numberand see how the phenolics are developing,and, you know, gauge its freshness.I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.It was very green, it was very peppery.But in the blind taste test, it came in last.The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle ofWhole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stovefor six months.(Laughter)A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan --you'll start to notice.I don't play golf, so I couldn't actually road test these,but I did interview a guy who owns them.Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean, they'll saythese have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speedand thereby drive the ball farther -- but they'll say, look, you know,you're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs.You're paying for the bling,that they're encrusted with gold and platinum.The guy who I interviewed who owns them did saythat he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them, so ...Oh, yeah, you know this one?This is a coffee made from a very unusual process.The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.It's a cat that lives in trees,and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations.And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know,hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans,and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavingsthen go through the forest collecting the, you know, resultsand processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy itin the unprocessed form.That's right.Unrelatedly --(Laughter)Japan is doing crazy things with toilets.(Laughter)There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it.There's one with a fragrance dispenser.There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowland transmits the results via email to your doctor.It's almost like a home medical center --and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in.This one does not have those bells and whistles,but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600.And to try this -- I couldn't get a loaner,but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer, Toto,and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use, which I used.It's fully automated -- you walk towards it, and the seat lifts.The seat is preheated.There's a water jet that cleans you.There's an air jet that dries you.You get up, it flushes by itself.The lid closes, it self-cleans.Not only is it a technological leap forward,but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward.I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.And I want to get one of these.(Laughter)This was another one I could not get a loaner of.Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.There's a little plaque on the end that, you know,each buyer gets their name engraved on it.(Laughter)To try this one, the maker of it let me and my wifespend the night in the Manhattan showroom.Lights glaring in off the street,and we had to hire a security guard and all these things.But anyway, we had a great night's sleep.And you spend a third of your life in bed.I don't think it's that bad of a deal.(Laughter)This was a fun one.This is the fastest street-legal car in the worldand the most expensive production car.I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company,a professional race car driver,and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angelesand down on the Pacific Coast Highway.And, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplightthe people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods.And it was really amazing.It was such a smooth ride.Most of the cars that I drive, if I get up to 80 they start to rattle.I switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said,"You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour."And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious peopleyou occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic,because it was just that smooth.And if I was a billionaire, I would get one.(Laughter)This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to showof one of the pitfalls of advanced technology.This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "Mission: Impossible III" premiere.When he tries to open the door,you could call it "Mission: Impossible IV."There was one object that I could not get my hands on,and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc.The '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century.And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeauxin having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape.And 1947 was a legendary vintage,especially in the right bank of Bordeaux.And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aurathat eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.But it's 60 years old.There's not much of it left.What there is of it left you don't know if it's real --it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world.Not that many people are looking to pop opentheir one remaining bottle for a journalist.So, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these.I'd put out feelers to retailers, to auctioneers,and it was coming up empty.And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai.Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicistwho also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings,and he said, "I've got a tasting coming upwhere we're going to serve the '47 Cheval Blanc."And it was going to be a double vertical --it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc,and 30 vintages of Yquem.And it was an invitation you do not refuse.I went.It was three days, four meals.And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.And you know, it had this fragrant softness,and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.And then I tasted it, and it,you know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness,which is characteristic of that wine --that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways.There were people at my table who thought it was, you know, fantastic.There were some people who were a little less impressed.And I wasn't that impressed.And I don't -- call my palate a philistine palate --so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed,but I was not the only one there who had that reaction.And it wasn't just to that wine.Any one of the wines served at this tasting,if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know,the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable.But drinking 60 great wines over three days,they all just blurred together,and it became almost a grueling experience.And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting studywhich came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech.And they gave subjects the same wine,labeled with different price tags.A lot of people, you know,said that they liked the more expensive wine more --it was the same wine, but they thought it was a different onethat was more expensive.But what was unexpected was that these researchers didMRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine,and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more --their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasurefrom the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag.Thank you.

We all make decisions every day; we want to knowwhat the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financialto the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to doexactly the right thing at all possible times,that would be a tremendous gift.It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,and I also want to explain to you why it isthat it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.Now, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.And if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.But the simple English translation -- much less precise,but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this:The expected value of any of our actions --that is, the goodness that we can count on getting --is the product of two simple things:the odds that this action will allow us to gain something,and the value of that gain to us.In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is,if we can estimate and multiply these two things,we will always know precisely how we should behave.Now, this simple equation, even for those of youwho don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's playa little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin,and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars,but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you knowthat the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,that multiplies to five, and that's morethan I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.Now, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses,but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.People are horrible at estimating both of these things,and that's what I want to talk to you about today.There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decidewhat the right thing is to do, and those areerrors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed,and errors in estimating the value of their own success.Now, let me talk about the first one first.Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy:there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spadesor of flipping a heads.But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to applyin everyday life. That's why Americans spend more --I should say, lose more -- gamblingthan on all other forms of entertainment combined.The reason is, this isn't how people do odds.The way people figure oddsrequires that we first talk a bit about pigs.Now, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you thinkthere are more dogs or pigs on leashesobserved in any particular day in Oxford.And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.And the way that you know that the answer is dogs isyou quickly reviewed in memory the timesyou've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.It was very easy to remember seeing dogs,not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumedthat if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind,then dogs on leashes are more probable.That's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.So, for example, here's a word puzzle.Are there more four-letter English wordswith R in the third place or R in the first place?Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung,and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.But in fact, there are many more words in the English languagewith R in the third than the first place.The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mindisn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.You kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes.It's like the dictionary;it's hard to look things up by the third letter.So, this is an example of how this idea thatthe quickness with which things come to mindcan give you a sense of their probability --how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the oddsthat they will die in a variety of interesting ways --these are estimates of number of deaths per yearper 200 million U.S. citizens.And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are askedto guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.Compare these to the actual numbers.Now, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all,two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.Two things are vastly underestimated:dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?When was the last time that you picked up a newspaperand the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"It's not interesting because it's so common.It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instancesof news stories or newsreels where we've seentornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuckwho's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.They don't come quickly to mind, and as a result,we vastly underestimate them.Indeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street gameof "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to sayit's the swimming pool that doesn't belong, because the swimming poolis the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous.The way that more of you are likely to die than the combinationof all three of the others that you see on the slide.The lottery is an excellent example, of course -- an excellent test-caseof people's ability to compute probabilities.And economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery --but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lotteryas a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoffby investing your money in a lottery ticketare approximately equivalent to flushing the moneydirectly down the toilet -- which, by the way,doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is,we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery,or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check --how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.When was the last time that you saw extensive interviewswith everybody who lost?Indeed, if we required that television stations runa 30-second interview with each loserevery time they interview a winner, the 100 million losersin the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half yearsof your undivided attention just to watch them say,"Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."Now, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television --no sleep, no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss,and then at the end there's 30 seconds of, "and I won,"the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.Look, I can prove this to you: here's a little lottery.There's 10 tickets in this lottery.Nine of them have been sold to these individuals.It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win,you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?Well, Bernoulli tells us it is.The expected value of this lottery is two dollars;this is a lottery in which you should invest your money.And most people say, "OK, I'll play."Now, a slightly different version of this lottery:imagine that the nine tickets are all ownedby one fat guy named Leroy.Leroy has nine tickets; there's one left.Do you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.Now, you can see the odds of winning haven't changed,but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win.It's easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?You can't say to yourself, "I'm as likely to win as anybody,"because you're not as likely to win as Leroy.The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guychanges your decision to play,even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.Now, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cakecompared to trying to estimate value:trying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it,how much pleasure it will give us.I want to talk now about errors in value.How much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?Most of you have the intuition that it's not --you wouldn't pay that for it.But in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requiresthat you ask one, and only one question, which is:What else can I do with 25 dollars?If you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australiaand realized that they're not going to serve you any food,but somebody in the row in front of you has just openedthe McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden archesis wafting over the seat, you think,I can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.I can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter!Suddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.On the other hand, if you're visiting an underdeveloped country,and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no,before I'd even told you anything about the context?Because most of you compared the price of this Big Macto the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking,"What else can I do with my money," comparing this investmentto other possible investments, you compared to the past.And this is a systematic error people make.What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.This is an error, and I can prove it to you by showingthe kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.For example, this is, of course,one of the most delicious tricks in marketing,is to say something used to be higher,and suddenly it seems like a very good deal.When people are asked about these two different jobs:a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K,a job where you're getting a salary cut each year,and one in which you're getting a salary increase,people like the second job better than the first, despite the factthey're all told they make much less money. Why?Because they had the sense that declining wages are worsethan rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higherin the declining period. Here's another nice example.Here's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600.Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story:$2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars,so you decide to mull it over for a week.By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone --the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500for something that was 700 last week.This tendency to compare to the pastis causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words,a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as goodas an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.Here's another example of how comparing to the pastcan befuddle our decisions.Imagine that you're going to the theater.You're on your way to the theater.In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.You also have a 20-dollar bill.When you arrive at the theater,you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it?Most people answer, no.Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario.You're on your way to the theater,and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?Now, just in case you're not getting it,here's a schematic of what happened, OK?(Laughter)Along the way, you lost something.In both cases, it was a piece of paper.In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.What the hell difference should it make?The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself,I'm not paying twice for the same thing.You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars --to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal.Comparing with the past causes many of the problemsthat behavioral economists and psychologists identifyin people's attempts to assign value.But even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past,we still make certain kinds of mistakes.And I'm going to show you one or two of them.One of the things we know about comparison:that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.So in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who werekind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum,didn't seem like such a great guy.Suddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.(Laughter)The comparison changes how we evaluate him.Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course,and they use this wisdom to help you --spare you the undue burden of money.And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shopand you had to buy a bottle of wine,and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?Most people don't want the most expensive,they don't want the least expensive.So, they will opt for the item in the middle.If you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive itemthat nobody will ever buy on the shelf,because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.So I'm telling you something you already knew:namely, that comparison changes the value of things.Here's why that's a problem:the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home,it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.The comparisons we make when we are appraising value,where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things,are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevilour attempts to make rational decisions.Let me just give you an example.I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.These are subjects coming to an experiment to be askedthe simplest of all questions:How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a roomis a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.In fact, these items that are sitting in the room changehow much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.Namely, those who are looking at Spamthink potato chips are going to be quite tasty;those who are looking at Godiva chocolatethink they won't be nearly so tasty.Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?Well, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you thatwhen you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks,what's sitting in the corner of the roommakes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparisonthat then does not carry through and change their experience.You've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never comeinto our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question:You want to buy a car stereo.The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars,but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.So would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?Most people say they would.They can't imagine buying it for twice the pricewhen, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.Now, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo,and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.Would you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars.Most people say, no, I'm going to schlep across townto save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should.Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! --doesn't know where it came from.It doesn't know what you saved it on.When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go,I'm the money saved on the car stereo, or,I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucksno matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manageris taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment,but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste.Now, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons,because what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucksto the purchase that you're making,but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.You've all had this experience.If you're an American, for example, you've probably traveled in France.And at some point you may have met a couplefrom your own hometown, and you thought,"Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me.I mean, compared to all these people who hate mewhen I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't,these people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them,and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner,and what do you find?Compared to your regular friends,they are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context,the comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourselfdisliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.You go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers --these big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers,and you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference:the big ones sound a little better.And so you buy them, and you bring them home,and you entirely violate the décor of your house.And the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the storeis a comparison you'll never make again.What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go,"Sounds so much better than those little ones,"which you can't even remember hearing.The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficultwhen these choices are arrayed over time.People have a lot of trouble making decisionsabout things that will happen at different points in time.And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discoveredis that by and large people use two simple rules.So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problemand then a third, hard, problem.Here's the first easy problem:You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?All of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is,we believe more is better than less.Here's the second problem:You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?Again, an easy decision,because we all know that now is better than later.What's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict.For example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gainby waiting, but you have to be patient.What do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?Well, by and large people are enormously impatient.That is, they require interest rates in the hundredor thousands of percents in order to delay gratificationand wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.Maybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable ishow easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changingwhen the delivery of these monetary units will happen.Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months --or 60 dollars in 13 months.What do we find now?People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12,they might as well wait 13.What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen?Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggestedyou would show if I gave you time to respond, which is,people find that the subjective value of 50 is higherthan the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in nowor one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay --but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decisionoff into the future a year.Now, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?These guys can tell us.What you see here are two lads,one of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon,and I want you to notice two things.At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.However, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.First it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch,then a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth.Here are the results of what I just showed you.This is the subjective height --the height you saw of these guys at various points.And I want you to see that two things are true.One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look;and two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman,but at a far distancetheir normal, their true, relations are preserved.As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.These are the results of the hard problem I gave you:60 now or 50 in a month?And these are subjective values,and what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.People always think more is better than less:60 is always better than 50,and they always think now is better than later:the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.Watch what happens when we drop some out.Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars nowover waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely, thatwhen people get to the future, they will change their minds.That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say,what was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?I'll take the 50 dollars now.Well, the question with which I'd like to end is this:If we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?Because I could go on for about two hours with evidenceof people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value.The answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heardin some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again:namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different worldthan the one in which we are living.They were evolved for a worldin which people lived in very small groups,rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves,had rather short lives in which there were few choicesand the highest priority was to eat and mate today.Bernoulli's gift, Bernoulli's little formula, allows us, it tells ushow we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.That explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explainswhy it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.We are the only species on this planetthat has ever held its own fate in its hands.We have no significant predators,we're the masters of our physical environment;the things that normally cause species to become extinctare no longer any threat to us.The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom usare our own decisions.If we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be becausewe could not take advantage of the gift given to usby a young Dutch fellow in 1738,because we underestimated the odds of our future painsand overestimated the value of our present pleasures.Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: That was remarkable.We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two.Bill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanismis in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us,and is there some way that we could counteract that?Dan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recentlywith the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believesthat American security dollars should go to making borders safer.I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a namebased on people's psychological reaction to a set of events,and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might askwhat causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified,rather than -- not rather than, but in addition tostopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to --and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.We already know, for example, in the United States,more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes --because they were scared -- and driving on highways,than were killed in 9/11. OK?If I told you that there was a plaguethat was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year,you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wonderingwhether they should get the kind of play,the kind of coverage, that they do.Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihoodthat they'll be hurt in these various ways,and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.CA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're sayingthat our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?Talk more about it.DG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.If Australia disappears tomorrow,terror is probably the right response.That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand,when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed,more people than that were killedby not using their seatbelts in the same country.Is terror the right response?CA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event --that it's so spectacular?Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?What is it?DG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.First, it's a human agent trying to kill us --it's not a tree falling on us by accident.Second, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason --as if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.So there are a number of things that togethermake this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play downthe fact that newspapers sell when people see something in itthey want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media,who want these things to beas spectacular as they possibly can.CA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?DG: Well, go to Israel. You know,go to Israel. And a mall blows up,and then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later --at least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mallwhen it blew up -- I went back to my hoteland the wedding that was planned was still going on.And as the Israeli mother said,she said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."I mean, this is a society that has learned --and there are others too -- that has learned to livewith a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it,shall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.CA: But is there a rational fear that actually,the reason we're frightened about this is because we think thatthe Big One is to come?DG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attackthere would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people --we would probably not be nearly so frightened.I don't want to say -- please, I'm going to get quoted somewhereas saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed."That's not my point at all.What I'm saying is that, surely, rationally,our distress about things that happen, about threats,should be roughly proportional to the size of those threatsand threats to come.I think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today --how many people do you know got up and said,Poverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.It's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.There are no guns going off.I mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris,which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?(Laughter)(Applause)That's a tough one.CA: There's no question.Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude,unless someone can show that there's, you know,terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.The latest I've read, seen, thoughtis that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.If that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly,but with poverty it's a bit --DG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty.CA: We've evolved to get all excitedabout these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past,in the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like diseaseand systems that cause poverty and so forth,and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energyinto worrying about those things?People died; so be it.But if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.And so we evolved these responses.Is that what happened?DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skepticalabout leaping to evolutionary explanations for everythingare the evolutionary psychologists themselves.My guess is that there's nothing quite that specificin our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking foran evolutionary explanation, you might saythat most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they're a little scaredof stuff that's new and different.And there's a good reason to be,because old stuff didn't eat you. Right?Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likelyto be a predator than one that you've never seen before.So, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before,our general tendency is to orient towardsthat which is new and novel is activated.I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanismas the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it.Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk aboutthe stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspectyou're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of,which is the error of value.I know, because I've interviewedabout 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.That's what you think it is. All right?The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year,so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose,and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.It's because the anticipation of possibly winningreleases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feelinguntil the drawing indicates you've lost.Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment,you can have a much better feeling than flushing the moneydown the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.Now, economists tend to --(Applause)-- economists tend to view the worldthrough their own lenses, which is:this is just a bunch of stupid people.And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is,we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.(Applause)DG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seenwhether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaledby the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember,people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either,even though they don't feel great during the drawing.I would disagree that people know they're not going to win.I think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen,which is why they prefer that to the flushing.But certainly I see your point: that there can besome utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.Now, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists.That isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.CA: Last question.Aubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills --I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it,as we'll all hear tomorrow.I very much resonate with what you're saying,because it seems to me that the problemwith getting people interested in doing anything about agingis that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like canceror heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?(Laughter)DG: For you or for them?AdG: In persuading them.DG: Ah, for you in persuading them.Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to workis to get people to imagine the future more vividly.One of the problems with making decisions about the far futureand the near future is that we imagine the near futuremuch more vividly than the far future.To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detailthat people put into the mental representationsof near and far future, people begin to make decisionsabout the two in the same way.So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you're 65is a question that's very different than,imagine who you'll be when you're 65: will you be living,what will you look like, how much hair will you have,who will you be living with.Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario,suddenly we feel like it might be important to saveso that that guy has a little retirement money.But these are tricks around the margins.I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency,which is to say, "I'm here today,and so now is more important than later."CA: Dan, thank you. Members of the audience,that was a fantastic session. Thank you.(Applause)

These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years,and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet.This is an example of a real meteorite,and you can see all the melting of the ironfrom the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth,and just how much of it survives and melts.From a meteorite from space,we’re over here with an original Sputnik.This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space.This is not a copy.The space age began 50 years ago in October,and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like.And it wouldn’t be fun to talk about the space agewithout seeing a flag that was carriedto the moon and back, on Apollo 11.The astronauts each got to carryabout ten silk flags in their personal kits.They would bring them back and mount them.So this has actually been carried to the moonand back.So that’s for fun.The dawn of books is, of course, important.And it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of bookswithout having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenbergin 1455.But what’s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology,is not the book.You see, the book was not driven by reading.In 1455, nobody could read.So why did the printing press succeed?This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible.So you’re looking here at one of the first printed booksusing movable type in the history of man,550 years ago.We are living at the age here at the end of the book,where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it.But why is this so interesting? Here’s the quick story.It turns out that in the 1450s,the Catholic Church needed money,and so theyactually hand-wrote these things called indulgences,which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper.They traveled all around Europeand sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.They got you out of purgatory faster.And when the printing press was inventedwhat they found was they could print indulgences,which was the equivalent of printing money.And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in 1455 --to print out thousands,and then hundreds of thousands,and then ultimately millionsof single, small pieces of paperthat got you out of middle hell and into heaven.That is why the printing press succeeded,and that is why Martin Luthernailed his 90 theses to the door:because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amokin printing out indulgences and selling themin every town and village and city in all of Western Europe.So the printing press, ladies and gentlemen,was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenessesand had nothing to do with reading.More tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the libraryfor those of you that have asked for pictures.We’re going to have some tomorrow.(Applause)Instead of showing an object from the stageI’m going to do something special for the first time.We are going to show, actually, what the library looks like, OK?So, I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world.You’re going to find out why in a minute,because when I went to see Eileen,this is what I said I wanted to build.This is the Library of Human Imagination.The room itself is three stories tall.In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imaginationthat are computer controlled.The room is a theatre. It changes colors.And all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.It’s designed like an Escher print.Here is some of the lower level of the library,where the exhibits constantly change.You can walk through. You can touch.You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room.There’s my very own Saturn V.Everybody should have one, OK? (Laughter)So you can see here in the lower level of the librarythe books and the objects.In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination.There is a glass bridge that you walk acrossthat’s suspended in space.So it’s a leap of imagination.How do we create?Part of the question that I have answered is,is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli:with human achievement, with history,with the things that drive us and make us human --the passionate discovery, the bones of dinosaurs long gone,the maps of space that we’ve experienced,and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination.So hopefully tomorrow I’ll showone or two more objects from the stage,but for today I just wanted to say thank youfor all the people that came and talked to us about it.And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our homeand share it with the TED community.(Applause)TED is all about patterns in the clouds.It’s all about connections.It’s all about seeing thingsthat everybody else has seen beforebut thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.And that’s really what discovery and imagination is all about.For example, we can lookat a DNA molecule model here.None of us really have ever seen one,but we know it exists because we’ve been taughtto understand this molecule.But we can also look at an Enigma machinefrom the Nazis in World War IIthat was a coding and decoding machine.Now, you might say, what does this have to do with this?Well, this is the code for life,and this is a code for death.These two moleculescode and decode.And yet, looking at them, you would see a machine and a molecule.But once you’ve seen them in a new way,you realize that both of these things really are connected.And they’re connected primarily because of this here.You see, this is a human brain model, OK?And it’s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.We get to see a skull. But there it is.All of imagination -- everything that we think,we feel, we sense -- comes through the human brain.And once we create new patterns in this brain,once we shape the brain in a new way,it never returns to its original shape.And I’ll give you a quick example.We think about the Internet;we think about information that goes across the Internet.And we never think about the hidden connection.But I brought along here a lump of coal --right here, one lump of coal.And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet?You see, it takes the energy in one lump of coalto move one megabyte of information across the net.So every time you download a file,each megabyte is a lump of coal.What that means is, a 200-megabyte filelooks like this, ladies and gentlemen. OK?So the next time you download a gigabyte,or two gigabytes, it’s not for free, OK?The connection is the energy it takes to run the web ,and to make everything we think possible, possible.Thanks, Chris.(Applause)

This is Aunt Zip from Sodom, North Carolina.She was 105 years old when I took this picture.She was always saying things that made me stop and think, like,"Time may be a great healer, but it ain't no beauty specialist."(Laughter)She said, "Be good to your friends.Why, without them, you'd be a total stranger."(Laughter)This is one of her songs.Let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together.And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me.Give him a big old hand.(Applause)One, two, three, four.(Music)Well, my true love's a black-eyed daisy;if I don't see her, I go crazy.My true love lives up the river;a few more jumps and I'll be with her.Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.Now you've got to picture Aunt Zip at 105 years old in Sodom, North Carolina.I'd go up and learn these old songs from her.She couldn't sing much, couldn't play anymore.And I'd pull her out on the front porch.Down below, there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule.A double outhouse over here on the side.And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy,so I'd sing, "Hey, hey!" and she'd just answer back with, "Black-eyed Susie."Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.Well, she and I went blackberry picking.She got mad; I took a licking.Ducks on the millpond, geese in the ocean,Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion.Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.Let's have the banjo.Well, we'll get married next Thanksgiving.I'll lay around; she'll make a living.She'll cook blackjacks, I'll cook gravy;we'll have chicken someday, maybe.Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey!One more time now.Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.(Applause)Thank you, Michael.This is Ralph Stanley.When I was going to college at University of Californiaat Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies,taking majors in biology and art, he came to the campus.This was in 1968, I guess it was.And he played his bluegrass style of music,but near the end of the concert, he played the old timing style of banjo pickingthat came from Africa, along with the banjo.It's called claw-hammer style, that he had learned from his mother and grandmother.I fell in love with that.I went up to him and said, how can I learn that?He said, well, you can go back to Clinch Mountain, where I'm from,or Asheville or Mount Airy, North Carolina --some place that has a lot of music.Because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style.So I went back that very summer.I just fell in love with the culture and the people.And you know, I came back to school, I finished my degreesand told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player.You can imagine how excited they were.So I thought I would just like to show you some of the picturesI've taken of some of my mentors.Just a few of them, but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks.And play a little banjo. Let's do a little medley.(Music)(Applause)Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks, who just passed away last year.He was one of the great American folk tale-tellers.The Old Jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this,you could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful.And he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built.No running water, no electricity. A wonderful, wonderful guy.And you can look at more pictures.I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've doneof some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you.This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow.It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world,and still played in the Southern mountains.Now, the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this.They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up.It was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.It sounds something like this.(Music)Well, have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joyabout the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys?You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.Now, they were scouts in the rebels' army,they were known both far and wide.When the Yankees saw them coming, they'd lay down their guns and hide.You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.Ain't that a sound?(Applause)Well, it was 1954, I guess it was.We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville, Texas,where I grew up in the early part of my life.Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store.My mom was driving; my brother and I were in the back seat.We were really mad at my mom. We looked out the window.We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields.You see, we'd just been to the grocery store,and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltinethat had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it.And, buddy, that made us mad.Well, my mom didn't put up with much either, and she was driving, and she said,"You boys! You think you can have anything you want.You don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard.You think money grows on trees. You've never worked a day in your lives.You boys make me so mad. You're going to get a job this summer."She pulled the car over; she said, "Get out of the car."My brother and I stepped out of the car.We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton.There were about a hundred black folks out there picking.My mom grabbed us by the shoulders. She marched us out in the field.She went up to the foreman; she said,"I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives."Of course, we were just eight and 10.(Laughter)She said, "Would you put them to work?"Well, that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman:put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton fieldin August in Texas -- it's hot.So he gave us each a cotton sack,about 10 feet long, about that big around, and we started picking.Now, cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers.And if you don't know what you're doing,your hands are bleeding in no time.And my brother and I started to pick it,and our hands were startin' to bleed, and then -- "Mom!"And Mom was just sitting by the car like this.She wasn't going to give up.Well, the foreman could see he was in over his head, I guess.He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice.He just sang: "Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.Don't want it to leave me behind.Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.Don't want it to leave me behind."And from all around as people started singing and answering back, he sang:"Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.Good news: Chariot's coming.Good news: Chariot's coming.And I don't want it to leave me behind."Now, my brother and I had never heard anything like thatin our whole lives. It was so beautiful.We sat there all day picking cotton, without complaining,without crying, while they sang things like:"Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan" and "Wade in the water,"and "I done done," "This little light of mine."Finally, by the end of the day,we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton.But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar,but my mother would never let us cash it.I'm 57; still have the check.Now, my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work.But if you have children, you know it doesn't often work that way.No, we learned something else.The first thing I learned that daywas that I never ever wanted to work that hard again.(Laughter)And pretty much never did.But I also learned that some people in this worlddo have to work that hard every day, and that was an eye-opener.And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier.And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can.Now, I was just a little eight-year-old boy that daywhen my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field.I wasn't even aware of music -- not even aware of it.But that day in the cotton field out there picking,when those people started singing,I realized I was in the very heart of real music,and that's where I've wanted to be ever since.Try this old song with me. I sing:Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.You sing: Don't want it to leave me behind.Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.Don't want it to leave me behind.Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.Good news: Chariot's coming.Good news: Chariot's coming.And I don't want it to leave me --It's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton, isn't it?Let's try it one more time.There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.Don't want it to leave me behind.There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.Don't want it to leave me behind.Good news: Chariot's coming.Good news: Chariot's coming.Good news: Chariot's coming.And I don't want it to leave me behind.It was a few years ago, but I sort of remembered this story,and I told it at a concert.My mom was in the audience.After the -- she was glad to have a story about herself, of course,but after the concert she came up and she said,"David, I've got to tell you something.I set that whole thing up.I set it up with the foreman. I set it up with the owner of the land.I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work.I didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though."Let's try. Good news: Chariot's coming.Good news: Chariot's coming.Good news: Chariot's coming.And I don't want it to leave me behind.(Applause)Well, this is the steel guitar. It's an American-made instrument.It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers,who later on made the Dobro, which is a wood-bodied instrumentwith a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from.It's usually played flat on your lap.It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s,before they had electric guitars, trying to make a loud guitar.And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck,just like that -- a nice Merlot works very well.That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect.Break it off, put it on your finger, and slide into the notes.This instrument pretty much saved my life.Fifteen years ago, 14 years ago, I guess, this year,my wife and I lost our daughter, Sarah Jane, in a car accident,and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world.And I think I learned a lot about what happiness wasby going through such unbelievable grief,just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in.I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive.I had to sit down and make lists, because I was ready to go;I was ready to check out of this world.And you know, at the top of the list, of course,were Jenny, and my son, Zeb, my parents -- I didn't want to hurt them.But then, when I thought about it beyond that,it was very simple things.I didn't care about -- I had a radio show,I have a radio show on public radio, "Riverwalk,"I didn't care about that. I didn't care about awards or money or anything.Nothing. Nothing.On the list it would be stuff like,seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring, the smell of new-mown hay,catching a wave and bodysurfing, the touch of a baby's hand,the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar,listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon.And for me, the sound of a steel guitar,because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things.And I would sit around with it, and I didn't know how to play it,but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play.And it was the only instrument that, of all the ones that I play,that would really make that connection.This is a song that came out of that.(Music)Well, I hear you're having trouble.Lord, I hate to hear that news.If you want to talk about it, you know, I will listen to you through.Words no longer say it; let me tell you what I always do.I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues.People say, "Oh, snap out of it!"Oh yeah, that's easier said than done.While you can hardly move, they're running around having all kinds of fun.Sometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues.Now, you can try to keep it all insidewith drink and drugs and cigarettes,but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get.But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose.Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues.Open up now.(Applause)Oh, I think I've got time to tell you about this. My dad was an inventor.We moved to California when Sputnik went up, in 1957.And he was working on gyroscopes;he has a number of patents for that kind of thing.And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney.They were about my age.John went on, and Michael did too,to become some of the inventors of computer animation.Michael's dad was working on something called the computer.This was 1957, I was a little 10-year-old kid;I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one,you know, what they were making. It was like a library,just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see,just floors and floors of these things,and one of the engineers said,some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket.I thought, damn, those are going to be some big pants!(Laughter)So that Christmas -- maybe I've got time for this --that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set.Well, I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad; so did Michael.His great-granddad had been Eli Whitney,the inventor of the cotton gin.So we looked in that --this was a commercial chemistry set.It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see:sulfur, potassium nitrate and charcoal.Man, we were only 10, but we knew that made gunpowder.We made up a little batch and we put it on the drivewayand we threw a match and phew, it flared up. Ah, it was great.Well, obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon.So we went over into Michael's garage --his dad had all kinds of stuff, and we put a pipe in the vice there,and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe,drilled a hole in the back of the pipe, took some of our firecrackers,pulled out the fuses, tied them together, put them in the back there,and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowderdown that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top, in the garage.(Laughter)We weren't stupid: we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it.We stood back, we lit that thing,and they flew out of there -- they went through that plywood like it was paper.Through the garage.Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen.(Laughter)We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard.That was Pacific Palisades; it probably is still there, back there.Well, my brother heard that we had made gunpowder.He and his buddies, they were older, and they were pretty mean.They said they were going to beat us upif we didn't make some gunpowder for them.We said, well, what are you going to do with it?They said, we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel.(Laughter)Sure. We'll make you a big batch.(Laughter)So we made them a big batch, and it was in my --now, we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California.Mom had redone the kitchen; Mom was gone that day. We had a pie tin.It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down.Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen.He said, "Yeah, hey, it's melting. Yeah, the sulfur's melting.No problem. Yeah, you know."It just flared up, and he turned around, and he looked like this.No hair, no eyelashes, no nothing.There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet;the air was the just full of black smoke.She came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again.But we thought of it often, because every time she'd cook tuna surpriseit made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder.So I like to invent things too,and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back.When drum machines were new, I got to thinking,why couldn't you take the oldest form of music, the hambone rhythms,and combine it with the newest technology?I call this Thunderwear.At that time, drum triggers were new.And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit.I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday;I'm going to be doing some of the same ones.I have a trigger here, trigger here, here, here. Right there.It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay.Now, the drum triggers go out my tail here, into the drum machine,and they can make various sounds, like drums.So let me put them all together. And also, I can change the soundsby stepping on this pedal right here, and --let me just close out here by doing you a littlehambone solo or something like this.Thank you, folks.(Applause)

In 1962, Buckminster Fullerpresented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope.It was a 200-foot diameter geodesic sphereto be suspended over the East River in New York City, in full view of the United Nations.It was a big idea, for sure, and it was one that he felt could truly informand deeply affect the decision making of this bodythrough animations of global data, trendsand other information regarding the globe, on this sphere.And today, 45 years later,we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective,but what we do have is improved technology.Today we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display.We can use LEDs.LEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient.Most importantly for this, they're faster.And this speed, combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers,allows us to actually simulate, in this piece,over 17,000 LEDs -- using just 64.And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision.But as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm -- that's 28 times per second.The equator's speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.There are four on-board micro-controllersthat, each time this ring rotatesit, as it passes the rear of the display,it picks up a position signal.And from that, the on-board micro-controllerscan extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolutionand display arbitrary bitmap images and animations.But this is really just the beginning.In addition to higher resolution versions of this display,my father and I are working on a new patent-pending designfor a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon.It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.So as you can see here, this is a, eleven-inch diameter circuit board.These blocks represent LEDs.And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis,it will create a disc of light that we can control.That's nothing new: that's a propeller clock;that's the rims that you can buy for your car.But what is new is that, when we rotate this disc about this axis,this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light.And so we can control that with micro-controllersand create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs.Now this piece is currently in process --due out in May -- but what we've done is we've put together a small demo,just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere.I've got a little video to show you,but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control,and this is also with only four LEDs.This is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final display will be in May.So, take a look.And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only, creating circles.And then, as the other axis kicks in,those actually blur into a volume.And the shutter speed of the cameraactually makes it slightly less effective in this case.But this piece is due out in May.It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Showin Greenwich Village in New York City -- that's open to the public,definitely invite you all to come and attend -- it's a fantastic show.There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects.This piece, actually, will be on displaydown in the Sierra Simulcast Loungein the breaks between now and the end of the show.So I'd love to talk to you all, and invite youto come down and take a closer look.It's an honor to be here. Thanks very much.(Applause)

You know, we're going to do things a little differently.I'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you.And at the same time, we're going to look at just imagesfrom a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that --snapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating.You can -- I can compete for your attention with the strange picturesthat you see on screen that come from there.I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this,and then get John back out here so we can talk interactivelya little bit more and think and ask questions.You know, I guess the first question is,why build a virtual world at all?And I think the answer to that is always going to beat least driven to a certain extent by the peopleinitially crazy enough to start the project, you know.So I can give you a little bit of first background just on meand what moved me as a -- really going back as far as a teenagerand then an adult, to actually try and build this kind of thing.I was a very creative kid who read a lot, and got into electronics first,and then later, programming computers, when I was really young.I was just always trying to make things.I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things,and just anything I could do with my hands or with woodor electronics or metal or anything else.And so, for example -- and it's a great Second Life thing -- I had a bedroom.And every kid, you know, as a teenager, has got his bedroom he retreats to --but I wanted my door, I thought it would be cool if my door went uprather than opened, like on Star Trek.I thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceilingand I cut through the ceiling joists, much to my parents' delight,and put the door, you know, being pulled up through the ceiling.I built -- I put a garage-door opener up in the atticthat would pull this door up.You can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the houseand the displeasure of my parents.The thing that was always striking to me was that we as peoplecould have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do,but are so often unable, in the real world, to actually do those things --to actually cobble together the materialsand go through the actual execution phase of building somethingthat you imagine from a design perspective.And so for me, I know that when the Internet came aroundand I was doing computer programming and just, you know,just generally trying to run my own little companyand figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers,I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thingthat you would really want to do with the Internet and with computerswould be to use the Internet and connected computersto simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physicsand the rules of how things went together --the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things,and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff.And so for me that was the thing that was so enticing.I just wanted this place where you could build things.And so I think you see that in the genesisof what has happened with Second Life, and I think it's important.I also think that more generally, the use of the Internet and technologyas a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend.It is a -- sort of a great human progress.Technology is just generally being used to allow us to createin as shared and social a way as possible.And I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generallyrepresent the best we can do to achieve that right now.You know, another way to look at that,and related to the content and, you know, thinking about space,is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space.I thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second.If you think about going into space, it's a fascinating thing.So many movies, so many kids, we all sort ofdream about exploring space. Now, why is that?Stop for a moment and ask, why that conceit?Why do we as people want to do that?I think there's a couple of things. It's what we see in the movies --you know, it's this dream that we all share.One is that if you went into space you'd be able to begin again.In some sense, you would become someone else in that journey,because there wouldn't be -- you'd leave society and life as you know it, behind.And so inevitably, you would transform yourself --irreversibly, in all likelihood -- as you began this exploration.And then the second thing is that there's this tangible sensethat if you travel far enough, you can find out there --oh, yeah -- you have no idea what you're going to findonce you get there, into space.It's going to be different than here.And in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earththat anything is going to be possible.So that's kind of the idea -- we as humans crave the idea ofcreating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible.And I think that if you really sit and think about it,virtual worlds, and where we're goingwith more and more computing technology,represent essentially the likely, really tactically possibleversion of space exploration.We are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because, like space,they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anythingand everything, and probably anything could happen there.You know, to give you a size idea about scale, you know,comparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of --and then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s.In fact, Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '90s today:everybody's very excited,there's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the nextfrom moment to moment, and then there's despairand everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work.Everything that's happening with Second Lifeand more broadly with virtual worlds, all happened in the early '90s.We always play a game at the office where you can take any articleand find the same article where you just replace the words "Second Life"with "Web," and "virtual reality" with "Internet."You can find exactly the same articleswritten about everything that people are observing.To give you an idea of scale, Second Life is about 20,000 CPUs at this point.It's about 20,000 computers connected togetherin three facilities in the United States right now,that are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself --there's about 250,000 people a day that are wandering around in there,so the kind of, active population is something like a smallish city.The space itself is about 10 times the size of San Francisco,and it's about as densely built out.So it gives you an idea of scale. Now, it's expanding very rapidly --about five percent a month or so right now, in terms of new servers being added.And so of course, radically unlike the real world,and like the Internet, the whole thing is expandingvery, very quickly, and historically exponentially.So that sort of space exploration thing is matched up hereby the amount of content that's in there,and I think that amount is critical.It was critical with the virtual worldthat it be this space of truly infinite possibility.We're very sensitive to that as humans.You know, you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a spaceand you know when you can't.Second Life today is this 20,000 machines,and it's about 100 million or so user-created objects where, you know,an object would be something like this, possibly interactive.Tens of millions of them are thinking all the time;they have code attached to them.So it's a really large world already, in terms of the amount of stuff that's thereand that's very important.If anybody plays, like, World of Warcraft,World of Warcraft comes on, like, four DVDs.Second Life, by comparison, has about 100 terabytesof user-created data, making it about 25,000 times larger.So again, like the Internet compared to AOL,and the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time,what's happening here is something very different,because the sheer scale of what people can dowhen they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing.The last big thought is that it is almost certainly truethat whatever this is going to evolve intois going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself.And let me justify that with two statements.Generically, what we use the Web for is to organize, exchange,create and consume information.It's kind of like Irene talking about Google being data-driven.I'd say I kind of think about the world as being information.Everything that we interact with, all the experiences that we have,is kind of us flowing through a sea of informationand interacting with it in different ways.The Web puts information in the form of text and images.The topology, the geography of the Web is text-to-text links for the most part.That's one way of organizing information,but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual worldthat I think are the important ways that they're very differentand much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web.The first is that, as I said, the --well, the first difference for virtual worlds is thatinformation is presented to you in the virtual worldusing the most powerful iconic symbolsthat you can possibly use with human beings.So for example, C-H-A-I-R is the English word for that,but a picture of this is a universal symbol.Everybody knows what it means. There's no need to translate it.It's also more memorable if I show you that picture,and I show you C-H-A-I-R on a piece of paper.You can do tests that show that you'll rememberthat I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better.So when you organize information using the symbols of our memory,using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives,you maximally both excite, stimulate,are able to remember, transfer and manipulate data.And so virtual worlds are the best wayfor us to essentially organize and experience information.And I think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years --you know, that 3D, that lifelike environmentsare really important in some magical way to us.But the second thing -- and I think this one is less obvious --is that the experience of creating, consuming, exploring that informationis in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social.You are always there with other people.And we as humans are social creatures and must, or are aided by,or enjoy more, the consumption of information in the presence of others.It's essential to us. You can't escape it.When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever,you're on there right now, when you're on the site, with like 5,000 other people,but you can't talk to them.You can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital camerason the same page as you, and ask them,"Hey, have you seen one of these before? Because I'm thinking about buying it."That experience of like, shopping together, just as a simple example,is an example of how as social creatureswe want to experience information in that way.So that second point, that we inherently experience information togetheror want to experience it together,is critical to essentially, kind of,this trend of where we're going to use technology to connect us.And so I think, again, that it's likely that in the next decade or sothese virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beingsthat we kind of use the electronics of the Internet, if you will,to be together, to consume information.You know, mapping in India -- that's such a great example.Maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time.Asking for advice, rather than any possible waythat you could just statically organize a map.So I think that's another big point.I think that wherever this is all going,whether it's Second Life or its descendants, or something broaderthat happens all around the world at a lot of different points --this is what we're going to see the Internet used for,and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert,so that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical informationis going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern,but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment.Big idea, but I think highly defensible.So let me stop there and bring John back,and maybe we can just have a longer conversation.Thank you. John. That's great.(Applause)John Hockenberry: Why is the creation, the impulse to create Second Life,not a utopian impulse?Like for example, in the 19th century,any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worldswere explicitly utopian.Philip Rosedale: I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah.Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia, would be one way I'd say it.The answer is no, and I think the reason why is becausethe Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up.That idea of infinite possibility, that magic of anything can happen,only happens in an environmentwhere you really know that there's a fundamental freedomat the level of the individual actor, at the level of the Lego blocks,if you will, that make up the virtual world.You have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that,you know, is there a, kind of, utopian or,is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it,that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it?Those top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody,even if you mean well when you build them.And what's more, human society, when it's controlled,when you set out a grand scheme of rules,a new way of people interacting, or a new way of laying out a city, or whatever,that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond,you know -- I always laughingly say -- the Mall of America, you know,which is like, the largest piece of centrally designed architecturethat, you know, has been built.JH: The Kremlin was pretty big.PR: The Kremlin, yeah. That's true. The whole complex.JH: Give me a story of a tool you created at the beginningin Second Life that you were pretty sure people would want to usein the creation of their avatars or in communicatingthat people actually in practice said, no, I'm not interested in that at all,and name something that you didn't come up withthat almost immediately people began to demand.PR: I'm sure I can think of multiple examples of both of those.One of my favorites. I had this feature that I built into Second Life --I was really passionate about it.It was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebodyand have a more private conversation,but it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody.It was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat.I just remember it was one of those examples of data-driven design.I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective,and it was just absolutely never used, and we ultimately --I think we've now turned it off, if I remember.We finally gave up, took it out of the code.But more generally, you know, one other example I think about this,which is great relative to the utopian idea.Second Life originally had 16 simulators. It now has 20,000.So when it only had 16,it was only about as big as this college campus.And we had -- we zoned it, you know: we put a nightclub,we put a disco where you could dance,and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to,and we had another place that was like a boardwalk, kind of a Coney Island.And we laid out the zoning, but of course,people could build all around it however they wanted to.And what was so amazing right from the start was that the ideathat we had put out in the zoning concept, basically,was instantly and thoroughly ignored,and like, two months into the whole thing,-- which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time --I remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life,the residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco --because I had built it -- we want to buy that land and raze itand put houses on it. And I sold it to them --I mean, we transferred ownership and they had a big partyand blew up the entire building.And I remember that that was just so telling, you know,that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen.When you think about stuff that people have built that's popular --JH: CBGB's has to close eventually, you know. That's the rule.PR: Exactly. And it -- but it closed on day one, basically, in Internet time.You know, an example of something -- pregnancy.You can have a baby in Second Life.This is done entirely using, kind of, the tools that are built into Second Life,so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby, of course --Second Life is, at the platform level, at the level of the company -- at Linden Lab --Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever.There is no attempt to structure the experience,to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it.So of course, we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or, you know,taking two avatars and merging them, or something.But people built the ability to have babies and care for babiesas a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so --I mean, that's a pretty fascinating example of, you know,what goes on in the overall economy.And of course, the existence of an economy is another idea.I didn't talk about it, but it's a critical feature.When people are given the opportunity to create in the world,there's really two things they want.One is fair ownership of the things they create.And then the second one is -- if they feel like it,and they're not going to do it in every case, but in many they are --they want to actually be able to sell that creationas a way of providing for their own livelihood.True on the Web -- also true in Second Life.And so the existence of an economy is critical.JH: Questions for Philip Rosedale? Right here.(Audience: Well, first an observation, which is that you look like a character.)JH: The observation is, Philip has been accused of looking like a character,an avatar, in Second Life.Respond, and then we'll get the rest of your question.PR: But I don't look like my avatar.(Laughter)How many people here know what my avatar looks like?That's probably not very many.JH: Are you ripping off somebody else's avatar with that, sort of --PR: No, no. I didn't. One of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar --a female avatar -- that I used to be once in a while.But my avatar is a guy wearing chaps.Spiky hair -- spikier than this. Kind of orange hair.Handlebar mustache. Kind of a Village People sort of a character.So, very cool.JH: And your question?(Audience: [Unclear].)JH: The question is, there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in Second Life.It doesn't seem to have its own culture,and the sort of differences that exist in the real worldaren't translated into the Second Life map.PR: Well, first of all, we're very early,so this has only been going on for a few years.And so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behaviorthat you see in emerging societies.So a fair criticism -- is what it is -- of Second Life today is thatit's more like the Wild West than it is like Rome, from a cultural standpoint.That said, the evolution of, and the nuanced interaction that creates culture,is happening at 10 times the speed of the real world,and in an environment where, if you walk into a bar in Second Life,65 percent of the people there are not in the United States,and in fact are speaking their, you know, various and different languages.In fact, one of the ways to make money in Second Lifeis to make really cool translators that you drag onto your bodyand they basically, kind of, pop up on your screenand allow you to use Google or Babel Fishor one of the other online text translators to on-the-flytranslate spoken -- I'm sorry -- typed text between individuals.And so, the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting potthat's happening inside Second Life is quite --I think, quite remarkable relative to what in real human termsin the real world we've ever been able to achieve.So, I think that culture will fine-tune, it will emerge,but we still have some years to wait while that happens,as you would naturally expect.JH: Other questions? Right here.(Audience: What's your demographic?)JH: What's your demographic?PR: So, the question is, what's the demographic.So, the average age of a person in Second Life is 32,however, the use of Second Life increases dramaticallyas your physical age increases. So as you go from age 30 to age 60 --and there are many people in their sixties using Second Life --this is also not a sharp curve -- it's very, very distributed --usage goes up in terms of, like, hours per week by 40 percentas you go from age 30 to age 60 in real life, so there's not --many people make the mistake of believing that Second Lifeis some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing --I'm just speaking broadly and critically --it's not very appealing to people that play online video games,because the graphics are not yet equivalent to --I mean, these are very nice pictures,but in general the graphics are not quite equivalentto the fine-tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto 4.So average age: 32. I mentioned65 percent of the users are not in the United States.The distribution amongst countries is extremely broad.There's users from, you know, virtually every country in the world now in Second Life.The dominant ones are -- if you take the UK and Europe,together they make up about 55 percent of the usage base in Second Life.In terms of psychographic --oh, men and women: men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life,so about 45 percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women.Women use Second Life, though,about 30 to 40 percent more, on an hours basis, than men do,meaning that more men sign up than women,and more women stay and use it than men.So that's another demographic fact.In terms of psychographic, you know, the people in Second Lifeare remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think,when you go in and talk to them and meet them, and I would, you know,challenge you to just do this and find out.But it's not a bunch of programmers.It's not easy to describe as a demographic.If I had to just sort of paint a broad picture, I'd say, remember the peoplewho were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay?Maybe a little bit like that: in other words, people who are early adopters.They tend to be creative. They tend to be entrepreneurial.A lot of them -- about 55,000 people so far -- are cash-flow positive:they're making money from what -- I mean, real-world money --from what they're doing in Second Life, so it's a very build --still a creative, building things, build-your-own-businesstype of an orientation. So, that's it.JH: You describe yourself, Philip, as someone who was really creativewhen you were young and, you know, liked to make things.I mean, it's not often that you hear somebodydescribe themselves as really creative.I suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C studentwho spent a lot of time in his room? Is it possible?(Laughter)PR: I was a -- there were times I was a C student. You know, it's funny.When I got to college -- I studied physics in college --and I got really -- it was funny,because I was definitely a more antisocial kid. I read all the time.I was shy. I don't seem like it now, but I was very shy.Moved around a bunch -- had that experience too.So I did, kind of, I think, live in my own world,and obviously that helps, you know, engage your real interest in something.JH: So you're on your fifth life at this point?PR: If you count, yeah, cities. So -- but I did --and I didn't do -- I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have. I think you're right.I wasn't, like, an obsessed -- you know, get A's kind of guy.I was going to say, I had a great social experiencewhen I went to college that I hadn't had before,a more fraternal experience, where I met six or seven other guyswho I studied physics with, and I was very competitive with them,so then I started to get A's. But you're right: I wasn't an A student.JH: Last question. Right here.(Audience: In the pamphlet, there's a statement -- )JH: You want to paraphrase that?PR: Yeah, so let me restate that.So, you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statementthat we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones --our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities --and that in fact, much of human life and human experiencemay move into the digital realm.And then that's kind of a horrifying thought, of course.That's a frightening change, frightening disruption.I guess, and you're asking, what do I think about that? How do I --JH: What's your response to the people who would say, that's horrifying?(Audience: If someone would say to you, I find that disturbing,what would be your response?)PR: Well, I'd say a couple of things.One is, it's disturbing like the Internet or electricity was.That is to say, it's a big change, but it isn't avoidable.So, no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavioror political behavior is going to keep these technology changesfrom connecting us together,because the basic motive that people have --to be creative and entrepreneurial -- is going to drive energyinto these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web.So this change, I believe, is a huge disruptive change.Obviously, I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here,but I think that as -- even a sober, you know, the most sober,disconnected thinker about this, looking at it from the side,has to conclude, based on the data,that with those kinds of economic forces at play,there is definitely going to be a sea change,and that change is going to be intensely disruptiverelative to our concept of our very lives and being,and our identities, as well.I don't think we can get away from those changes.I think generally, we were talking about this --I think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it,being -- surviving there, having a good life there, so to speak,is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it,because of the languages, because of the entrepreneurial richness of it,the sort of flea market nature, if you will, of the virtual world today.It puts challenges on us to rise to. We must be better than ourselves, in many ways.We must learn things and, you know, be more tolerant,and be smarter and learn faster and be more creative, perhaps,than we are typically in our real lives.And I think that if that is true of virtual worlds,then these changes, though scary -- and, I say, inevitable --are ultimately for the better,and therefore something that we should ride out.But I would say that -- and many other authors and speakers about this,other than me, have said, you know, fasten your seat beltsbecause the change is coming. There are going to be big changes.JH: Philip Rosedale, thank you very much.(Applause)

Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity.Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful.Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom,make education seem like a bright idea.(Laughter)Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation,or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so.Great creativity can make politicians electable,or parties unelectable.It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirtsand phrases on our lips.It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple roadthrough an impenetrable moral maze.Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable,more magical. And now we need that magic.This is a time of need.Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly.And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well:to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements.To tempt us to act differentlywith delightful creative scraps.Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved inusing creativity to inspire people to be greener.(Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk.Narrator: And so he walked, and as he walked he saw things.Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen.A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle.A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall.And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her.The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fieldsand broken his heart.Sure, she had aged a little.In fact, she had aged a lot.But he felt all his old passion for her return."Ford," he called softly. For that was her name."Don't say another word, Gusty," she said,for that was his name."I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here.Let's go there and make love. In the tent."Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmicallywhile she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.The earth moved for both of them.And they lived together happily ever after.And all because he decided to walk that day.(Applause)Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate.The moral imperative is on the table.Great creativity is needed to take it all,make it simple and sharp.To make it connect. To make it make people want to act.So this is a call, a plea,to the incredibly talented TED community.Let's get creative against climate change.And let's do it soon. Thank you.(Applause)

I went to Spain a few months agoand I had the best foie gras of my life.The best culinary experience of my life.Because what I saw, I'm convinced, is the future of cooking.Ridiculous, right?Foie gras and the future of cooking.There's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras, right?I mean, it's crucified.It was outlawed in Chicago for a while.It's pending here in California, and just recently in New York.It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu,you risk being attacked.Really, it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef.I'm not saying that there's not a rationalefor being opposed to foie gras.The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding.Basically you take a goose or a duckand you force feed a ton of grain down its throat.More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime.Its liver expands by eight times.Suffice to say it's like -- it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming.The problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious.(Laughter)I mean, I love the stuff.It is fatty, it's sweet, it's silky, it's unctuous.It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible.Can we produce a menu that's delicious without foie gras?Yes, sure.You can also bike the Tour de France without steroids, right?(Laughter)Not a lot of people are doing it.And for good reason.(Laughter)So several months ago, a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy,Eduardo Sousa.Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.Natural foie gras.What's natural about foie gras?To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall,geese and ducks gorge on foodto prepare for the harsh realities of winter.And the rest of the year they're free to roam around Eduardo's landand eat what they want.So no gavage, no force feeding,no factory-like conditions, no cruelty.And it's shockingly not a new idea.His great-granddad started -- Patería de Sousa -- in 1812.And they've been doing it quietly ever since.That is until last year,when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur,the coveted French gastronomic prize.It's like the Olympics of food products.He placed first for his foie gras.Big, big problem.As he said to me, that really pissed the French off.(Laughter)He said it sort of gleefully.It was all over the papers.I read about it. It was in Le Monde."Spanish chef accused ... " -- and the French accused him."Spanish chef accused of cheating."They accused him of paying off the judges.They implicated actually, the Spanish government, amazingly.Huh, amazing.A huge scandal for a few weeks.Couldn't find a shred of evidence.Now, look at the guy.He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judgesfor his foie gras.So that died down, and very soon afterward,new controversy.He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras.It's not foie gras because it's not gavage.There's no force feeding.So by definition, he's lying and should be disqualified.As funny as it sounds, articulating it now and reading about it --actually, if we had talked about it before this controversy,I would have said, "That's kind of true."You know, foie gras by definition, force feeding, it's gavage,and that's what you get when you want foie gras.That is, until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura,50 miles north of Seville, right on the Portugal border.I saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complexand then at the same time, like everything beautiful in nature,is utterly simple.And he said to me, really from the first moment,my life's work is to give the geese what they want.He repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him.I'm just here to give the geese what they want.Actually, when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phonetaking pictures of themlike his children in the grass.Amazing.He's really just in love with -- he's at one with --he's the goose whisperer.(Laughter)And when I was speaking to him, you know, I thought,like I'm speaking to you now, right,but sort of in the middle of my questions, my excited questions,because the more I got to know him and his system,the more exciting this whole idea became.He kept going like this to me.And I thought, OK, excited Jew from New York, right?I'm talking a little too aggressively, whatever,so you know, I slowed down.And finally, by the end of the day I was like,Ed-uar-do, you know like this?But he was still going like this.I figured it out.I was speaking too loudly.So I hushed my voice.I kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translatorin kind of a half whisper.And he stopped doing this.And amazingly, the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around --"Get the hell away from this kid!" --when I lowered my voice, they all came right up to us.Right up to us, like right up to here.Right along the fence line.And fence line was amazing in itself.The fence -- like this conception of fence that we haveit's totally backward with him.The electricity on this fiberglass fenceis only on the outside.He rewired it. He invented it.I've never seen it. Have you?You fence in animals. You electrify the inside.He doesn't.He electrifies only the outside.Why?Because he said to me that he felt like the geese --and he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this --the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks.Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Edenwith figs and everything else.He felt like they felt manipulated.So he got rid of the electricity,he got rid of current on the insideand kept it on the outside,so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators.Now, what happened?They ate, and he showed me on a chart,how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers.The landscape is incredible.I mean, his farm is incredible.It really is the Garden of Eden.There's figs and everything else there for the taking.And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura, the area --what does Extremadura mean?Extra hard land, right?Extra difficult. Extra hard.But over four generations, he and his familyhave literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu.Upgrades the life for these geese.And they are allowed to take whatever they want.Another irony, the double ironyis that on the figs and the olives,Eduardo can make more money selling thosethan he can on the foie gras.He doesn't care.He lets them take what they want and he says,"Usually, it's about 50 percent. They're very fair."The other 50 percent, he takes and he sells and he makes money on them.Part of the income for his farm.A big part of his income for his farm.But he never controls it.They get what they want,they leave the rest for me and I sell it.His biggest obstacle, really, was the marketplace,which demands these days bright yellow foie gras.That's how I've been trained.You want to look and see what good foie gras is,it's got to be bright yellow.It's the indication that it's the best foie gras.Well, because he doesn't force feed,because he doesn't gavage tons of corn,his livers were pretty grey.Or they were.But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush.The Lupin bush, it's all around Extremadura.He let it go to seed, he took the seeds,he planted it on his 30 acres, all around.And the geese love the Lupin bush.Not for the bush, but for the seeds.And when they eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow.Radioactive yellow.Bright yellow.Of the highest quality foie gras yellow I've ever seen.(Laughter)So I'm listening to all this, you know, and I'm like,is this guy for real? Is he making some of this up?Is he like, you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything,and it was always nature.It was never him.And I was like, you know, I always get a little, like,weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves.Because, really, they want you to look at themselves, right?But he deflected everything away from his ingenuityinto working with his landscape.So it's like, here I am, I'm on the fence about this guy,but increasingly, eating up his every word.And we're sitting there, and I hear [clapping] from a distance, so I look over.And he grabs my arm and the translator's,and ducks us under a bush and says, "Watch this.""Shush," he says again for the 500th time to me."Shush, watch this."And this squadron of geese come over.[Clapping]And they're getting louder, louder, louder, like really loud, right over us.And like airport traffic control, as they start to go past usthey're called back -- and they're called back and back and back.And then they circle around.And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.[Clapping]And the wild geese are calling down.[Clapping]And it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circleand they land.And I'm just saying, "No way."(Laughter)No way.And I look at Eduardo, who's near tears looking at this,and I say, "You're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geeseto say come for a visit?"And he says, "No, no, no.They've come to stay."They've come to stay?(Laughter)It's like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter, right?I said that. I said "Isn't that what they're put on this Earth for?To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?"He said, "No, no, no.Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life.To happiness.They find it here.They don't need anything more."They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese,and his flock continues.Think about that for a minute.It's brilliant, right?Imagine -- I don't know, imagine a hog farmin, like, North Carolina,and a wild pig comes upon a factory farmand decides to stay.(Laughter)So how did it taste?I finally got to taste it before I left.He took me to his neighborhood restaurantand he served me some of his foie gras, confit de foie gras.It was incredible.And the problem with saying that, of course, is thatyou know, at this point it risks hyperbole really easily.And I'd like to make a metaphor, but I don't have one really.I was drinking this guy's Kool-Aid so much,he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like,this guy's a genius, you know?I'm really in love with him at this point.But it truly was the best foie gras of my life.So much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment.I'd had something that was called foie gras.But this was transformative. Really transformative.And I say to you, I might not stick to this,but I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu againbecause of that taste experience with Eduardo.It was sweet, it was unctuous.It had all the qualities of foie gras,but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty.And you could taste herbs, you could taste spices.And I kept -- I said, you know, I swear to God I tasted star anise.I was sure of it.And I'm not like some super taster, you know?But I can taste things.There's 100 percent star anise in there.And he says, "No."And I ended up like going down the spices,and finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper,thinking he's salted and peppered his liver.But no.He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras,he sticks them in this jarand he confits it.No salt, no pepper, no oil, no spices.What?We went back out for the final tour of the farm,and he showed me the wild pepper plantsand the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity.He doesn't need salt and pepper.And he doesn't need spices, because he's got this potpourri of herbs and flavorsthat his geese love to gorge on.I turned to him at the end of the meal,and it's a question I asked several times,and he hadn't, kind of, answered me directly,but I said, "Now look, you're in Spain,some of the greatest chefs in the world are --Ferran Adria, the preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you.How come you don't give him this?How come no one's really heard of you?"And it may be because of the wine,or it may be because of my excitement,he answered me directly and he said, "Because chefs don't deserve my foie gras."(Laughter)And he was right.He was right.Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own.They create a dishwhere all the vectors point at us.With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature.And as he said, I think fittingly,it's a gift from God, with God saying, you've done good work.Simple.I flew home, I'm on the flight with my little black bookand I took, you know, pages and pages of notes about it.I really was moved.And in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes,is this note that says, when asked,what do you think of conventional foie gras?What do you think of foie gras that99.99999 percent of the world eats?He said, "I think it's an insult to history."And I wrote, insult to history.I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out.It's like, why didn't I follow up on that?What the hell does that mean?Insult to history.So I did some research when I got back,and here's what I found.The history of foie gras.Jews invented foie gras.True story.True story.By accident.They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz.Gotten sick of the chicken fat.They were looking for an alternative.And they saw in the fall that there was this natural,beautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese.And they slaughtered them, used the fat throughout the winter for cooking.The Pharaoh got wind of this --This is true, right off the Internet.The Pharaoh got -- (Laughter)I swear to God.(Laughter)The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it.He tasted it and fell in love with it.He started demanding it.And he didn't want it just in the fall, he wanted it all year round.And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone.And the Jews, fearing for their life,had to come up with an ingenious idea,or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes, of course.And they invented, what? Gavage.They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives,and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver,and the good stuff they kept for themselves.Supposedly, anyway. I believe that one.That's the history of foie gras.And if you think about it,it's the history of industrial agriculture.It's the history of what we eat today.Most of what we eat today.Mega-farms, feed lots, chemical amendments,long-distance travel, food processing.All of it, our food system.That's also an insult to history.It's an insult to the basic laws of natureand of biology.Whether we're talking about beef cattleor we're talking about chickens,or we're talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts,or in the case of this morning's New York Times, catfish --which wholesale are going out of business.Whatever it is, it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors.It's rooted in extraction.Take more, sell more, waste more.And for the future it won't serve us.Jonas Salk has a great quote.He said, "If all the insects disappeared,life on Earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years.If human beings disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would flourish."And he's right.We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture.Really new.One in which we stop treating the planetas if it were some kind of business in liquidation.And stop degrading resources under the guise ofcheap food.We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo.Farmers that rely on naturefor solutions, for answers,rather than imposing solutions on nature.Listening as Janine Benyus,one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says,"Listening to nature's operating instructions."That's what Eduardo does, and does so brilliantly.And what he showed me and what he can show all of us, I think,is that the great thing for chefs, the great blessing for chefs,and for people that care about food and cooking,is that the most ecological choice for foodis also the most ethical choice for food.Whether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras.And it's also almost always, and I haven't found an example otherwise,but almost always, the most delicious choice.That's serendipitous.Thank you.(Applause)

I have a story, a story that I would like to share with you.And it's an African story.It is a story of hope, resilience and glamour.There was Hollywood.Then came Bollywood.Today we have Nollywood, the third-largest film industry in the world.In 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria.Now, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every weekin the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa.Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars.It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.And it's expanding.But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement.This is something that happened without foreign investment,without government aid, and actually, it happened against all odds,in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy.The industry is 15 years old.And so maybe you're thinking now,why, how, an Italian filmmaker based in Bostonis so interested in this story?And so I think I have to tell you just a few words,a few things about my personal life,because I think there is a connection.My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia.My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa.And I was born in Zambia.Even though I left when I was only three years old,I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life.And it really was a place where I learned to walk.I think I uttered the first words,and my family bought their first home.So when we came back to Italy,and one of the things that I remember the mostis my family having this hard time to share stories.It seemed that for our neighbors and friends,Africa was either this exotic place, this imaginary landthat probably exists only in their imagination,or the place of horror, famine.And so we were always caught in this stereotype.And I remember really this desire to talk about Africaas a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives,and have dreams like we all have.So when I read in a newspaper in the business pagethe story of Nollywood,I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a storythat goes against all these preconceived notions.Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do,and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me.I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residenceat the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University.And we really look how digital technology is changing,and how young, independent filmmakerscan make movies at a fraction of the cost.So when I proposed the story,I really had all the support to make this film.And not only had the support,I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure.Aimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer,and Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor,who is a veteran of National Geographic,and told me, "You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa,I don't know if I have come across a storythat is so full of hope and so fun."So we went to Lagos in October 2005.And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa,a wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight.The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood,of this incredible film industry,following Bond in his quest to make an action moviethat deals with the issue of corruption,called "Checkpoint."Police corruption.And he had nine days to make it.We thought this was a good story.In the meantime, we had to cover Nollywood,and we talked to a lot of filmmakers.But I don't want to create too many expectations.I would like to show you six minutes.And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience.There are several themes from the documentary,but they are re-edited and made for you, OK?So I guess it's a world premier.(Video)Man: Action.Milverton Nwokedi: You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here.And you shoot in seven days.Peace Piberesima: We're doing films for the masses.We're not doing films for the eliteand the people in their glass houses.They can afford to watch their "Robocop" and whatever.Mahmood Ali Balogun: I think filmmaking in Nigeria, for those who work in it,is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living.It's not the fancy filmmaking where you say,oh, you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood,and where you have big budgets.Here is that you make these films,it sells, you jump onto the location again to make another film,because if you don't make the next film, you're not going to feed.Bond Emeruwa: So while we're entertaining, we should be able to educate.I believe in the power of audiovisuals.I mean, 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood.I think it's the most viable vehicle right nowto pass information across a dedicated cable.So if you're making a movie, no matter what your topic is,put in a message in there.Woman: You still have to report the incident.He needs proper medical attention.PP: I keep trying to explain to people,it's not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming.I mean, there are those films that people are making for quality,but the first thing you have to remember about this societyis that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day,and these are the people that really watch these films.Sonny McDon W: Nollywood is a fantastic industrythat has just been born in this part of the world.Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa.Lancelot Imasen: But our films,they are stories that our people can relate to themselves.They are stories about our people, for our people.And consistently, they are glued to their screenwhenever they see the story.Narrator: Suspense, fun and intrigue.It's the blockbuster comedy.You'll crack your ribs.Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi: We have been so deep into the foreign movies.It's all about the foreign movies.But we can do something too.We can do something, something that when the world sees it,they say, wow, this is Nigeria.Man: Just arrest yourself, sergeant.Don't embarrass yourself.Come on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back.SMW: You can now walk the street and see a role model.It’s not just what you see in picture.You see the person live.You see how he talks. You see how he lives.He influences you really good, you know.It’s not just what you see in the picture.It is not what you hear, you know, from the Western press.Man: See you. Bye.Action.Saint Obi: I was so fascinated, you know, with those cowboy movies.But then when I discovered the situation in my country,at that time there was so much corruption.For a young man to really make it out here,you got to think of some negative things and all that,or some kind of vices.And I didn't want that, you know.And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor,without doing crime, without cheating nobody, without telling no lies.Just me and God-given talent.Man: Let's go.OK, it's time to kick some ass.Cover this. It's your own.Move it.Roboger Animadu: In big countries, when they do the movies,they have all these things in place.But here, we improvise these items, like the gunshots.Like they go, here, now, now, you see the gun there,but you won't see any guns shot, we use knock-out.Kevin Books Ikeduba: What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face.Woman: That's why I use enough masking tape.The masking tape will hold it.Wat, wait. Just hold this for me.KBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it wellso that it won't affect my face -- the explosion, you know.But she's a professional. She knows what she’s doing.I'm trying to protect my face too.This ain't going to be my last movie.You know, this is Nollywood, where the magic lives.RA: So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here,with or without any assistance from anybody.Man: Action.Cut.(Applause)Franco Sacchi: So many things to say, so little time.So many themes in this story.I just can't tell you -- there’s one thing I want to tell you.I spent, you know, several weeks with all these actors, producers,and the problems they have to go through are unimaginablefor, you know, a Westerner, a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe.But always with a smile, always with an enthusiasm,that is incredible.Werner Herzog, the German filmmaker said,"I need to make movies like you need oxygen."And I think they’re breathing.The Nigerian filmmakers really, really, are doing what they like.And so it's a very, very important thing for them,and for their audiences.A woman told me, "When I see a Nollywood film,I can relax, I really -- I can breathe better."There is also another very important thingthat I hope will resonate with this audience.It’s technology. I’m very interested in itand I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know,the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be.Incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars.And this has unleashed tremendous energy.And guess what?We didn’t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers.They understood it, they embraced the technologyand they run with it, and they’re successful.I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology,look at the Nigerian model, make their films, create jobs,create a narrative for the population, something to identify,something positive, something that really is psychological reliefand it's part of the culture.But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us.I really think it goes both ways.Filmmakers, friends of mine, they look at Nollywood and they say,"Wow, they are doing what we really want to do,and make a buck and live with this job."So I really think it’s a lessonthat we're actually learning from them.And there's one thing, one small challenge that I have for you,and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling.And I think this is really the theme of this session.Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter, but no stories.No stories around the campfire.No legends, no fairytales.Nothing.No novels.Difficult, eh? It's meaningless.So this is what I really think.I think that the key to a healthy societyis a thriving community of storytellers,and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this.I would like you to hear their voices.Just a few moments.It’s not an added sequence, just some voices from Nollywood.(Video) Toyin Alousa: Nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them.If you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face,that’s Nollywood.SO: I believe very soon, we’re not only going to have better movies,we'll have that original Nigerian movie.BE: It’s still the same basic themes.Love, action.But we're telling it our own way, our own Nigerian way, African way.We have diverse cultures, diverse cultures, there are so many,that in the natal lifetimes,I don't see us exhausting the stories we have.FS: My job ends here, and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work.And I really hope that there will be many, many collaborations,where we teach each other things.And I really hope that this will happen.Thank you very much.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Stop. I've got two questions.Franco, you described this as the world's third largest film industry.What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films, really?FS: Oh, yes. I think I mentioned briefly -- it's close to 2,000 films.There is scientific data on this.CA: 2,000 films a year?FS: 2,000 films a year. 2005 or 6,the censor board has censored 1,600 films alone.And we know that there are more.So it’s safe to say that there are 2,000 films.So imagine 45 films per week.There are challenges. There are challenges.There is a glut of film,the quality has to be raised, they need to go to the next level,but I’m optimistic.CA: And these aren’t films that are primarily seen in cinemas?FS: Oh yes, of course. This is very important.Maybe, you know, for you to try to imagine this,these are films that are distributed directly in markets.They are bought in video shops.They can be rented for pennies.CA: On what format?FS: Oh, the format -- thank you for the question. Yes, it's VCDs.It's a CD, it's a little bit more compressed image.They started with VHS.They actually didn't wait for, you know, the latest technology.They started in '92, '94.So there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeriathat play, you know, VHS and these VCDs.It's a CD basically. It's a compact disc.CA: So on the streets, are film casts ... ?FS: You can be in a Lagos traffic jamand you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes.(Laughter)And I have to say, this really proves that storytelling,it's a commodity, it's a staple.There is no life without stories.CA: Franco, thank you so much.

I have, like, a thing about sleeping.I don't sleep that much,and I've come to this thing about, like, not sleeping muchas being a great virtue, after years of kind ofbattling it as being a terrible detriment, or something.And now I really like sort of sitting up, you know.But for years I've been sitting upand I think that, like, my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia.I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly.Sometimes I used to walk more at night.I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting.(Laughter)And sometimes -- actually, once it was on Page Six in the Post,that I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever,but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on.And so I was following this guy.And I took a picture of his shoes,and we thanked each other and just went on our way.But I do that all the time.As a matter of fact, I think a lot of my design ideascome from mistakes and tricks of the eye.Because I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there,so many clothes out there.And the only ones that look interesting to meare the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course,or very, very surprising.And often, I'm driving in a taxiand I see a hole in a shirt, or somethingthat looks very interesting or pretty or functionalin some way that I'd never seen happen before.And so I'd make the car stop, and I'd get out of the car and walk,and see that in fact there wasn't a hole, but it was a trick of my eye,it was a shadow, you know.Or if there was a hole I'd think like, oh damn,there was actually someone thought of that thought already.Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore.I don't know where inspiration comes from.It does not come for me from research.I don't get necessarily inspired by research.As a matter of fact, one of the most fun thingsI've ever, ever done in my whole life,was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York.I read "Peter and the Wolf" with this beautiful band from Juilliard.And I did like, you know, the narrator, and I read it.And I saw this really smart critic who I love.This woman, Joan Acocella, who's a friend of mine,and she came backstage and she said,oh, you know, Isaac, did you know that, talking about Stalinismand talking about, you know, like the '30s in Russia.And I said, how do I know about Stalinism?I know about a wolf and a bird and, you know,he ate the bird, and then in the end you hear, you know,you hear the bird squeaking, or something, you know?So I don't really know that. I don't really --actually I do my own kind of research, you know.If I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera, or something like that,I will do a lot of research, because it's interesting,not because it's what I'm supposed to do.I'm very, very, very inspired by movies.The color of movies and the way light makes the colors,light from behind the projection,or light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible.And anyway, roll this little clip, I'll just show you.I sit up at night and I watch moviesand I watch women in movies a lot.And I think about, you know, their roles,and about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at.Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time.Whether they're kind of glorified in this way,or whether they're kind of, you know, ironically glorified,or whether they're, you know, sort of denigrated, or ironically denigrated.I go back to color all the time.Color is something that motivates me a lot.It's rarely color that I find in nature,although, you know, juxtaposed next to artificial color,natural color is so beautiful.So that's what I do. I study color a lot.But for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anythingthat is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood?How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?I mean, that's just not possible, you know.And so that's what makes me lie awake at night, I guess, you know.I want to show you -- I'm also like a big --I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often,and that's another thing that motivates me a lot.People say, oh, do that. An astrologer tells me to do something.So I do it.(Laughter)When I was about 21, an astrologer told methat I was going to meet the man of my dreams,and that his name was going to be Eric, right?So, you know, for years I would go to barsand, sort of, anyone I met whose name was EricI was humping immediately, or something.(Laughter)And there were times when I was actually so desperateI would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, "Eric!"And anybody who would turn around I would, sort of, make a beeline for.(Laughter)And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago.The last card he pulled, which was representing my destinywas this guy on like a straw boater with a caneand you know, sort of spats and this, you know, a minstrel singer, right?I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thingwhere I do a cabaret act.So actually, check this out.Very embarrassing.(Video): Thank you. We can do anything you ask.The name of the show is based on this storythat I have to tell you about my mother.It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.I was dating this guy, right?And this has to do with being happy, I swear.I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year, right.And we were getting serious,so we decided to invite them all to dinner, our parents.And we, you know, sort of introduced them to each other.My mother was, sort of, very sensitive to his mother,who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing.You know, homosexuality, right?So my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said,"Are you kidding? They have the greatest life together.They eat out, they see shows."They eat out, they see shows.(Laughter)That's the name of the show, they eat out, they --that's on my tombstone when I die."He ate out, he saw shows," right?So in editing these clips, I didn't have the audacityto edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub.So you'll have to, like, go check it out and come see me or something.Because it's mortifying, and yet it feels ...I don't know how to put this.I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know.And at least, you know, in my case,because if I just do one thing all the time,I don't know, I get very, very bored. I bore very easily.And you know, I don't say that I do everything well,I just say that I do a lot of things, that's all.And I kind of try not to look back, you know.Except, I guess, that's what staying up every night is about.Like, looking back and thinking, what a fool you made of yourself, you know.But I guess that's okay. Right?Because if you do many thingsyou get to feel lousy about everything,and not just one, you know.You don't master feeling lousy about one thing.Yeah, exactly.I will show you this next thing,speaking of costumes for operas.I do work with different choreographers.I work with Twyla Tharp a lot,and I work with Mark Morris a lot,who is one of my best friends.And I designed three operas with him,and the most recent one, "King Arthur."I'd been very ingrained in the dance worldsince I was a teenager.I went to performing arts high school,where I was an actor.And many of my friends were ballet dancers.Again, I don't know where inspiration comes from.I don't know where it comes from.I started making puppets when I was a kid.Maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from, puppets, right.And then performing arts high school.There I was in high school,meeting dancers and acting.And somehow, from there, I got interested in design.I went to Parsons School of Designand then I began my career as a designer.I don't really think of myself as a designer,I don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer.And frankly, I don't really know what to call myself.I think of myself as a ... I don't know what I think of myself as.It's just that.(Laughter)But I must say, this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time,that is what -- I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer.You always have to be slightly bored with everything.And if you're not, you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything.(Laughter)But I am really a little bored with everything.I always say to my partner, Marisa Gardini, who books everything --she books everything and she makes everything happen.And she makes all the deals.And I always tell her that I find myselfwith a lot of time on the computer bridge program.Too much time on computer bridge, which is, you know, like that'sso ... somehow, like, about ten years agoI thought that the most unboring place in the worldwould be like a T.V. studio,like for a day show. Some kind of day talk show.Because it's all of these things that I loveall kind of in one place.And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing,and do another thing and talk about it, right?And so I had this T.V. show.And that was a very, very, very big part of my process.Actually, could you roll the clip, please?This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie.(Video) Isaac Mizrahi: We're back on the set.Hi there.Rosie O'Donnell: Hello, Ben.IM: Look how cute she looks with this, just a slick back.Man: Her grandmother says, "Delish!"IM: Ah, wow, delish. All right. So now where should I position myself?I want to stay out of the way.I don't want to be -- okay. Here we go.Do you get nervous, Ashleigh?Ashleigh: Doing what?ROD: Cutting hair.A: Cutting hair? Never, never.I don't think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous.IM: You look so cute already, by the way.ROD: You like it? All right.IM: Do you have a problem with looking cute? You want to look cute.ROD: Of course I want to look cute.IM: Just checking, because some people want to look, you know,aggressively ugly.ROD: No, not me, no.IM: You read about all these people who have a lot of moneyand they have kids and the kids always end up somehow, like,really messed up, you know what I mean?And there's got to be some way to do that, Rosie.Because just because if you're fabulously rich, and fabulously famous,does that mean you shouldn't have kids,because you know they're going to end up getting messed up?ROD: No, but it means that your priority has to betheir well-being first, I think.But you have to make the decision for yourself.My kids are seven, who the hell knows.They're going to be like 14 and in rehab.And they're going to be playing this clip:"I'm such a good mother."My God, this is the shortest I've ever had.IM: It looks good, yeah?A: I was going to ask you, has your hair ever been --ROD: No! It's all right -- go crazy.IM: I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here.A: Oh no, we're just staging,ROD: We're just staging it.IM: Are you freaking out? You look so cute.ROD: No, I love it. It's the new me.IM: Oh, it's so fabulous!ROD: Flock of Rosie. Wooo!IM: So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world, right.I mean, like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that.That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring.Actually, I read this great quote the other day, which was,"Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die."Right? And then I realized, that was on my website,and then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to meand I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview.I forgot that I said that. But it's really true.I want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye.I'll tell you that I cook a lot also. I love to cook.And I often look at things as though they're food.Like I say, oh, you know, would you serve a rotten chicken?Then how could you serve, you know, a beat up old dress or something.How could you show a beat up old dress?I always relate things to kitchen-ry.And so I think that's what it all boils down to.Everything boils down to that.So check this out.This is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world.It's, like, this website.It's got a lot of different things on it.It's a polymathematical website.We actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments.And it's kind of my favorite thing in the world.And it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows?And again, I don't say it's good, I just think it's not boring, right?And here is the last bit.(Video) IM: I have to tell you, I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time.Chef: Do you?IM: Yeah, but I can never find buttermilk, ever.Chef: Oh.IM: You can't find buttermilk at Citarella; you can't find buttermilk.Chef: You can't?IM: It's always low-fat buttermilk.Chef: No, but that's all it is.IM: Is that all it is?Chef: Oh, you don't know? Let me tell you something.Let me tell you something interesting.IM: You know what? Stop laughing. It's not funny.Just because I don't know that whole -- that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk.Sorry, what?Chef: Well, here's the deal. Let me tell you the deal.In the old days when they used to make butter,you know how you make butter?IM: Churns?Chef: For cream?IM: Yeah, exactly.Chef: So you take heavy, high-fat milk, which is cream,and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water.The liquid is actually that clear liquid.If you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream,it's actually buttermilk.And that's what it was in the early days.And that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things.Now, the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk.IM: Excuse me, I didn't know. All right?Chef: The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious.IM: Yeah, it is, exactly.So who would think that it was low-fat?Well, that's it. Thank you very much.Happy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it.Thanks. Bye.

My name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morningabout my project, Tidying Up Art.First of all -- any questions so far?First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.I'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervousbecause I'm speaking in a foreign language,and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.Because I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss GermanI'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds likeif we Swiss try to speak American.But don't worry -- I don't have trouble with English, as such.I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.(Laughter)I am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland,and you have to go on talking like this all the time.(Laughter)So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.It's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see,it's more or less a picture book.So the reading would be over very quickly.But since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way,in the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.I'd like to show them around so we can just, you know --(Laughter)Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better.So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.You won't be familiar with it.I mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years,and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald BaechlerI had hanging at home. I had to look at it every dayand after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymorethis guy was looking at all day long.Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.And it seemed to me even he felt really badfacing these unorganized red squares day after day.So I decided to give him a little support,and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.(Laughter)Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closelyat modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern artis particularly topsy-turvy.And I can show here a very good example.It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.It's a picture by Paul Klee.And we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.(Laughter)Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors.The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture --the whole thing is unstructured.We don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean --(Laughter)-- maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.We can see here he started out with orange,and then he already ran out of orange,and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.(Laughter)We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.Yeah, that's great.So I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.(Laughter)What can you say? What a mess.I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.If my room back home had looked like this,my mother would have grounded me for three days.So I'd like to -- I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.And that's really advanced tidying up.(Applause)Yeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point,but that's actually more in Switzerland.(Laughter)We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time.We are only happy when things are in order.But to go on, here is a very good example to see.This is a picture by Joan Miro.And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapesand dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.(Laughter)And this is my --(Laughter)-- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.It's more economical and also more efficient.With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,I brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works,because I've had my working methods patentedat the Eidgenössische Amt für Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.(Laughter)I'll just quote from the specification."Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht --"It's not finished yet."Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht Götz von Ohlenhusenwird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich geschützt welche die Kunstdurch spezifisch aufgeräumte Regelmässigkeitendes allgemeinen Formenschatzesneue Wirkungen zu erzielen möglich wird."Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser.I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people,that's why these patents are sometimes necessary.I would like to do a short test with you.Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah.The right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.And now, I'll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me.Now, I'll count to three, and on the count of threeI'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK?One, two, three.(Laughter)You can see now, that's a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic waycan sometimes lead to complete chaos.So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to seewhat this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.But in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.(Laughter)Yeah, it's a -- this one here, that's much better.That's a picture by Keith Haring.(Laughter)I think it doesn't matter.So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.It's called "Untitled" and I think that's appropriate.So, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop.(Laughter)This is Keith Haring looked at statistically.One can see here quite clearly,you can see we have 25 pale green elements,of which one is in the form of a circle.Or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.I mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysisto cover all Mr. Haring's various works,in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedureby using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.(Laughter)One can obviously also make combinations.For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet,put it in your office and you can make a living doing it.(Laughter)Yeah, from my own experience. So I'm --(Laughter)Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad.This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.(Laughter)But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.(Laughter)And here, that's one of my favorites.Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun.You know, there is a --(Laughter)I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.And you know, there you had this little sign --I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,"Please tidy room." I don't know if you have them over here.So actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.So after a while I decided to have a little fun,and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.Like books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great.By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.(Laughter)And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.And when I returned it looked like this.(Laughter)Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.(Laughter)OK, I mean, I can see there are always peoplethat like reacting that one or another picturehasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.This is a picture by Rene Magritte,and I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is --to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.(Laughter)Yeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.Some people would make apple pie out of it.But it's a very good example to see that the whole workwas more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming jobof cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.And it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer,otherwise it would look like this.(Laughter)So now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time.Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example.It's -- oh, no, it's -- that's a really hard one.But after a while, I just decided here to go all the wayand put the paint back into the cans.(Applause)Or you could go into three-dimensional art.Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.Here I just brought it back to its original state.(Laughter)But yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know --Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.The pointillist movement is that kind of paintingswhere everything is broken down into dots and pixels.And then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.(Laughter)So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat,and I collected together all his dots.And now they're all in here.(Laughter)You can count them afterwards, if you like.You see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea:it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it.There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.I mean, it's "the future we will create."(Laughter)But to round things up I would like to show you just one more.This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.That's how it looks like when you send everyone home.(Laughter)Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselveswhere old Bruegel's people went?Of course, they're not gone. They're all here.(Laughter)I just piled them up.(Laughter)So I'm -- yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.(Laughter)But before leaving I would like to show you,I'm working right now on another -- in a related fieldwith my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field.And I started to bring some order into some flags.Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.(Laughter)And then maybe before I leave you ...yeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.(Laughter)Yeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly,so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.(Laughter)Thank you very much.(Applause)

This was in an area called Wellawatta, a prime residential area in Colombo.We stood on the railroad tracksthat ran between my friend's house and the beach.The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally,but at that point the water had recededto a level three or four feet below normal.I'd never seen the reef here before.There were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water.Some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags.They were trying to catch fish.No one realized that this was a very bad idea.The people on the tracks just continued to watch them.I turned around to check on my friend's house.Then someone on the tracks screamed.Before I could turn around, everyone on the tracks was screaming and running.The water had started coming back. It was foaming over the reef.The children managed to run back onto the tracks.No one was lost there. But the water continued to climb.In about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracksand was coming over it. We had run about 100 meters by this time.It continued to rise.I saw an old man standing at his gate, knee-deep in water, refusing to move.He said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach,and that he would rather die there than run.A boy broke away from his mother to run back into his houseto get his dog, who was apparently afraid.An old lady, crying, was carried out of her house and up the road by her son.The slum built on the railroad reservationbetween the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away.Since this was a high-risk location, the police had warned the residents,and no one was there when the water rose.But they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings.For hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around --all of this was from the houses in the slum.When the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed.This may seem hard to believe --unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports --but in many places, after the tsunami, villagers were still terrified.When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homesand long-tail boats -- mercilessly, without warning --and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming,I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either.One of the scariest things about the tsunamithat I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information.This may seem minor, but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumorafter rumor that another tidal wave, bigger than the last,will be coming at exactly 1 p.m., or perhaps tonight, or perhaps ...You don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water,to catch a boat to the hospital.We think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed.We think this boat is going to Phuket hospital,but if it's too dangerous to land at its pier,then perhaps it will go to Krabi instead, which is more protected.We don't think another wave is coming right away.At the Phi Phi Hill Resort,I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television,but I strained to listen for information.They reported that there was an 8.5 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra,which triggered the massive tsunami.Having this news was comforting in some small wayto understand what had just happened to us.However, the report focused on what had already occurredand offered no information on what to expect now.In general, everything was merely hearsay and rumor,and not a single person I spoke to for over 36 hoursknew anything with any certainty.Those were two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogsthat essentially sprang up after it occurred.I'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunamithat also were shown on blogs.I should warn you, they're pretty powerful.One from Thailand, and the second one from Phuket as well.(Screaming)Voice 1: It's coming in. It's coming again.Voice 2: It's coming again?Voice 1: Yeah. It's coming again.Voice 2: Come get inside here.Voice 1: It's coming again. Voice 2: New wave?Voice 1: It's coming again. New wave![Unclear](Screaming)They called me out here.James Surowiecki: Phew. Those were both on this site: waveofdestruction.org.In the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami,because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that,although initially -- that is, in that first day --there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live videoand some people complained about this.They said, "The blogsters let us down."What became very clear was that,within a few days, the outpouring of information was immense,and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happenedin a way that we never had been able to get before.And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnectedwriters, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up witha collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better senseof what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.And so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment,a moment in which the blogosphere came, to a certain degree, of age.Now, I'm going to move now from this kind of --the sublime in the traditional sense of the word,that is to say, awe-inspiring, terrifying -- to the somewhat more mundane.Because when we think about blogs,I think for most of us who are concerned about them,we're primarily concerned with things like politics, technology, etc.And I want to ask three questions in this talk,in the 10 minutes that remain, about the blogosphere.The first one is, What does it tell us about our ideas,about what motivates people to do things?The second is, Do blogs genuinely have the possibilityof accessing a kind of collective intelligencethat has previously remained, for the most part, untapped?And then the third part is, What are the potential problems,or the dark side of blogs as we know them?OK, the first question:What do they tell us about why people do things?One of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically,and, of course, the Internet more generally --and it's going to seem like a very obvious point,but I think it is an important one to think about --is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of contentevery day, who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing,linking, commenting on the substance of the Internet,are doing so primarily for free.They are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and,to some extent, the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job.And this is -- at least, to a traditional economist -- somewhat remarkable,because the traditional account of economic man would say that,basically, you do things for a concrete reward, primarily financial.But instead, what we're finding on the Internet --and one of the great geniuses of it -- is that people have found a wayto work together without any money involved at all.They have come up with, in a sense, a different method for organizing activity.The Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler, in an essay called "Coase's Penguin,"talks about this open-source model, which we're familiar with from Linux,as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations.And, you know, if you think about this with the tsunami,what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists,who are producing enormous amounts of materialfor no reason other than to tell their stories.That's a very powerful idea, and it's a very powerful reality.And it's one that offers really interesting possibilitiesfor organizing a whole host of activities down the road.So, I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells usis that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational,and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money,or, you have to pay for it to be good,but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant productswithout any money at all changing hands.There are a few bloggers -- somewhere maybe around 20, now --who do, in fact, make some kind of money, and a fewwho are actually trying to make a full-time living out of it,but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love itor they love the attention, or whatever it is.So, Howard Rheingold has written a lot about thisand, I think, is writing about this more,but this notion of voluntary cooperationis an incredibly powerful one, and one worth thinking about.The second question is, What does the blogosphere actually do for us,in terms of accessing collective intelligence?You know, as Chris mentioned, I wrote a book called "The Wisdom of Crowds."And the premise of "The Wisdom of Crowds" is that,under the right conditions, groups can be remarkably intelligent.And they can actually often be smarterthan even the smartest person within them.The simplest example of this is if you ask a group of peopleto do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar.If I had a jar of jellybeansand I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar,your average guess would be remarkably good.It would be somewhere probably within three and five percentof the number of beans in the jar,and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you.There may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers,but for the most part the group's guesswould be better than just about all of you.And what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at workin many more complicated situations.For instance, if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack,they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win.In a sense, the group of betters at the racetrackis forecasting the future, in probabilistic terms.You know, if you think about something like Google,which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Webto seek out those sites that have the most valuable information --we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that,and it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thingwe call the "World Wide Web" actually has a remarkable order,or a remarkable intelligence in it.And this, I think, is one of the real promises of the blogosphere.Dan Gillmor -- whose book "We the Media"is included in the gift pack --has talked about it as saying that, as a writer,he's recognized that his readers know more than he does.And this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging ideato mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyonewho has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise,and who has a lot of energy invested in the notionthat he or she knows better than everyone else.But what the blogosphere offers is the possibilityof getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there,and that we know is available to usif we can just figure out a way of accessing it.Each blog post, each blog commentarymay not, in and of itself, be exactly what we're looking for,but collectively the judgment of those people posting, those people linking,more often than not is going to give you a very interestingand enormously valuable picture of what's going on.So, that's the positive side of it.That's the positive side of what is sometimes calledparticipatory journalism or citizen journalism, etc. --that, in fact, we are giving peoplewho have never been able to talk before a voice,and we're able to access information that has always been therebut has essentially gone untapped.But there is a dark side to this,and that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on.One of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet,and you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet,is that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet.It is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized,bottom-up structure of the Internet.It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things --that being linked from one place to another,that being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing.And much of the time it is.But there's also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side, in fact --and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other,the harder it is for each of us to remain independent.One of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that,once you are linked in the network,the network starts to shape your viewsand starts to shape your interactions with everybody else.That's one of the things that defines what a network is.A network is not just the product of its component parts.It is something more than that.It is, as Steven Johnson has talked about, an emergent phenomenon.Now, this has all these benefits:it's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information;it gives you access to a whole host of people;it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways.But the problem is that groups are only smartwhen the people in them are as independent as possible.This is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds,or the paradox of collective intelligence,that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking.And networks make it harder for people to do that,because they drive attention to the things that the network values.So, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphereis that once a meme, once an idea gets going,it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on,because other people have, say, a link.People have linked to it, and so other people in turn link to it, etc., etc.And that phenomenonof piling on the existing linksis one that is characteristic of the blogosphere,particularly of the political blogosphere,and it is one that essentially throws offthis beautiful, decentralized, bottom-up intelligencethat blogs can manifest in the right conditions.The metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill.A lot of people talk about ants.You know, this is a conference inspired by nature.When we talk about bottom-up, decentralized phenomena,the ant colony is the classic metaphor, because,no individual ant knows what it's doing,but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions.So, the ant colony is a great model:you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing.But we know that occasionally ants go astray,and what happens is that, if army ants are wandering around and they get lost,they start to follow a simple rule --just do what the ant in front of you does.And what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle.And there's this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet longand lasted for two days, and the ants just kept marching around and aroundin a circle until they died.And that, I think, is a sort of thing to watch out for.That's the thing we have to fear --is that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die.Now, I want to connect this back, though, to the tsunami,because one of the great things about the tsunami --in terms of the blogosphere's coverage,not in terms of the tsunami itself --is that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon.You saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic.in a way that they hadn't before.There, you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself.So, that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside.And I think that the former is what we really need to strive for.Thank you very much. (Applause)

This is very strange for me, because I’m not used to doing this:I usually stand on the other side of the light,and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...The previous speaker has, I think,really painted a very good background as tothe impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss,and trying to find the answer to the big questions.But this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this,feels like -- there’s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti,who after many years of living in France -- and learning, you know,studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?What have you done with so many years of being away?And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.And obviously they were, "Is this what you spent years doing?And we expected huge masterpieces!"But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieceswas the culmination of a man’s life, search, thought, everything --just in a reduced, small version.In a way, I feel like that.I feel like I’m coming home to talk aboutwhat I’ve been away doing for 20 years.And I will start with a brief taster of what I’ve been about:a handful of films -- nothing much,two feature films and a handful of short films.So, we’ll go with the first piece.(Video) Woman: "I destroy lives," mum said.I love her, you know.She’s not even my real mum.My real mum and dad dumped meand fucked off back to Nigeria.The devil is in me, Court.Court: Sleep.Woman: Have you ever been?Court: Where?Woman: Nigeria.Court: Never.My mum wanted to,couldn’t afford it.Woman: Wish I could.I have this feeling I’d be happy there.Why does everyone get rid of me?Court: I don't want to get rid of you.Woman: You don't need me.You’re just too blind to see it now.Boy: What do you do all day?Marcus: Read.Boy: Don't you get bored?And how come you ain't got a job anyway?Marcus: I am retired.Boy: So?Marcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself.Boy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day.Marcus: Because I do what I like?Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.Boy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.Marcus: You’re a rapper, am I right?Boy: Yeah.Marcus: A modern day poet.Boy: Yeah, you could say that.Marcus: So what do you talk about?Boy: What's that supposed to mean?Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about?Boy: Reality, man.Marcus: Whose reality?Boy: My fuckin' reality.Marcus: Tell me about your reality.Boy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life.Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just --Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.Marcus: With an AK-47?Boy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right.Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean.Marcus: When a man resorts to profanities,it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself.Boy: See man, you’re just taking the piss out of me now.Marcus: The Panthers.Boy: Panthers?Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit,and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse.Fuckin’ wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What?Director 1: I saw his last film.Épuise, right?Woman 1: Yes.D1: Not to make a bad joke, but it was really épuisé.Epuisé -- tired, exhausted, fed up.Director 2: Can you not shut up?Now, you talk straight to me, what’s wrong with my films?Let’s go.W1: They suck.Woman 2: They suck? What about yours?What, what, what, what about, what?What do you think about your movie?D1: My movies, they are OK, fine.They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees.What the fuck are you talking about?Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywoodto go and film something real?You make people fuckin' sleep.Dream about bullshit.(Applause)Newton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, istotally trying to capture what cinema is for me,and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema.The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria,that she has a feeling she'll be happy there.These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home.And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through.I've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.I've been away 20 years in total.And so it’s really --it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997,which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship,the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.So, for this girl to have these dreamsis simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful,because you just need something to hold on to,especially in a society where you feel alienated.Which takes us to the next piece, where the young mantalks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe,the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about,and his reality.Again, this was my -- this was me talking about --this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom,and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say,what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?And what would a child --what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think,I mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him?What happens with that?What, of course, happens with that is violence,which we see when we talk about the ghettosand we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff,and which eventually, when channeled, becomes,you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots --like the one in France two years ago, where I live,which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well,France is a liberal society."But I lived in England for 18 years.I've lived in France for about four, and I feel actuallythrown back 20 years, living in France.And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question:What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends --fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means.I suppose that will take me to my last piece --what cinema means for me.My life started as a -- I started life in 1966,a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three yearsand it was three years of war.So that whole thing,that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.(Video) Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother.Onicha: Yes, mama.Commander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle,so you must get ready and willing to die.You must get -- ?Child Soldiers: Ready and willing to die.C: Success, the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun.CS: The barrel of the gun!C: This is the gun.CS: This is the gun.C: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life.This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.Ezra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles.Amphetamines.Soldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.I say rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.We went from one village to another -- three villages.I don’t remember how we got there.Witness: We walked and walked for two days.We didn't eat.There was no food, just little rice.Without food -- I was sick.The injection made us not to have mind.God will forgive us.He knows we did not know. We did not know!Committee Chairman: Do you remember January 6th, 1999?Ezra: I don’t remember.Various Voices: You will die! You will die! (Screaming)Onicha: Ezra! (Ezra: Onicha! Onicha!)Various Voices: ♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫♫ No more trouble ♫They killed my mother.The Mende sons of bastards.(Shouting)Who is she?Me.Why you giving these to me?So you can stop staring at me.My story is a little bit complicated.I’m interested.Mariam is pregnant.You know what you are? A crocodile.Big mouth. Short legs.In front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward.He’s not taking care of his troops.Troop, pay your last honor. Salute.Open your eyes, Ezra.A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket.♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫Get that idiot out!I take you are preparing a major attack?This must be the mine.Your girl is here.Well done, well done.That is what you are here for, no?You are planning to go back to fight are you?♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫♫ No more trouble ♫♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫♫ No more trouble. ♫Wake up! Everybody wake up. Road block!♫ We don't need no more ... ♫Committee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commissionwill go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war.More than that, begin a healing process and finally to --as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country’s history.The beginning of hope.Mr. Ezra Gelehun, please stand.State your name and age for the commission.Ezra: My name is Ezra Gelehun.I am 15 or 16. I don’t remember.Ask my sister, she is the witch, she knows everything.(Sister: 16.)CC: Mr. Gelehun, I’d like to remind you you’re not on trial herefor any crimes you committed.E: We were fighting for our freedom.If killing in a war is a crime,then you have to charge every soldier in the world.War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.You too are a retired General, not so?CC: Yes, correct.E: So you too must stand trial then.Our government was corrupt.Lack of education was their way to control power.If I may ask, do you pay for school in your country?CC: No, we don’t.E: You are richer than us.But we pay for school.Your country talks about democracy,but you support corrupt governments like my own.Why? Because you want our diamond.Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before?No.CC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you, you're not on trial here today.You are not on trial.E: Then let me go.CC: I can't do that, son.E: So you are a liar.(Applause)NA: Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here,is that while we’re making all these huge advancements,what we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should --Africa should move forward, but we should remember,so we do not go back here again.Thank you.Emeka Okafor: Thank you, Newton.(Applause)One of the themes that comes through very stronglyin the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the youngthat have to play this role of being child soldiers.And considering where you are coming from,and when we consider the extent to which it’s not taken as seriouslyas it should be, what would you have to say about that?NA: In the process of my research, I actually spenta bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this.And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers --ex-combatants, as they like to be called.I met psychosocial workers who worked with them.I met psychiatrists who spent time with them,aid workers, NGOs, the whole lot.But I remember on the flight back on my last trip,I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself,if any kid in the West, in the western world,went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through,they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives.So for me, the thought that we have all these children --it’s a generation, we have a whole generation of children --who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage,and Africa has to live with that.But I’m just saying to factor that in,factor that in with all this great advancement,all this pronouncement of great achievement.That’s really my thinking.EO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage.That was a very moving piece.NA: Thank you.EO: Thank you.(Applause)

This means, "I'm smiling."So does that.This means "mouse.""Cat."Here we have a story.The start of the story, where this means guy,and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.Here's where it happens.These are when.This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.She wears it every day.It's not considered vintage --she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.Look at her posture; it's remarkable.That's because she dances.Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"(Laughter)And he could say, "Oh my God!"or "I heart you!""I'm laughing out loud.""I want to give you a hug."But he comes up with that, you know.He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug."(Laughter)Put a crab inside it.Add some water.Seven different salts.He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land,but just panhandle at the ocean.He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz."And the girl goes, "Wha'?"So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.At least, that's how it seems.I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes --for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy.I'm a monkey --(Laughter) --blowing kissesat a butterfly.But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.First, soon, and then a lot.I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow,but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.Hell, ponytail alone.I don't know what else to tell you.I got a pencil you can borrow.You can put it in your phone."But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.She just says, "No thank you."You know?[ "i don't need 2 write it down." ](Applause)

You all know this story.In the summer of 1950,Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicistand atomic-pile builder,went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratoryand joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:"Where is everybody?"This confused his colleagues, obviously,because they were sitting right there with him.And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them.He was talking about the space aliens.You see, this was only a few years afterthe supposed flying saucer crashat Roswell, New Mexico.And even though that turned out to be nothing,nothing at all --(Laughter) --merely a downed weather balloonpiloted by small hairless menwith slits for mouths ...Still, America had gone saucer-mad,even famous scientistswho were eating lunch.Fermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,is that the universe is so vastthat it stands to reason,there should be other intelligent life out there.And the universe is so oldthat unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,we should have some evidence of their existence by now.And yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone."Where is everybody?" asked Fermi,and his colleagues had no answer.Fermi then went on with the same blunt logicto disprove fairies,Sasquatch, God,the possibility of love --and thereafter, as you know,Enrico Fermi ate alone.(Laughter)Now,I am not a scientist.I have never built an atomic pile.Although, I might argue that, technically,every pile is atomic.(Laughter)However, with respect, I might point out two possibilitiesthat Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider.One is that the aliens might bevery far away.Perhaps, I dare say,even on other planets.The other possibility --(Laughter) --is, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himselfwas an alien.(Laughter)Think about it.Isn't it a little convenientthat in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere,suddenly an Italian scientist showed upwith an amazing new technologythat would transform everything in the worldand darken the history of the human species forever after?And isn't it a little strangethat he required no payment for this?That he asked for only one thing --a gift of two healthy sperm whales?That's -- that's not true.But it is strange.(Laughter)And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien,wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convincehis fellow scientiststhat the space aliens are not already here?For it is given in certain UFO-ologyor UFOlogy circles,that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;that they have walked among us in disguise,observing us, guiding our evolutionfrom ape to man --if you believe in that sort of thing --and, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucersand taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.(Laughter)It's a difficult theory to discount,I think you'll agree.(Laughter)For even in my own life,there are memories I havethat are difficult to explain --happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird,that it is difficult to imaginethey were not the resultof prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.For how else will you explainthe amazing and absolutely trueclose encounters that I hadand will describe to you now?Encounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.This was the summer when the special edition of"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was released.And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.(Laughter)And so I spent the rest of the vacationlargely sitting outside our little rental house at night,the sidewalk still warm from the sun,watching the skies for UFOs.What did I see? Stars, satellites,blinking airplanes -- typical sky junk.Occasionally, kids would come andjoin me and watch,but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalkto play video games and mingle with humans.I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part,so I stayed alone with the cosmos.And that's when it happened.An elderly couple came walking down the street.I would say they were in their late seventies,and I would say that they were on a date,because he was wearing a very neat little suitwith a yellow tie -- a brown suit.And she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully nightand a chill was coming in off the ocean.I remember, for some reason,that they were exactly the same height.And then they stopped, and the man turned to meand said,"What are you looking for,flying saucers?"(Laughter)You have to admit, that's a pretty boss piece of detective workfor an old man on a date.But what was stranger still --and even I realized it at the time,as a nine-year-old child --was that they stopped at all.That this old man would interrupt his moonlight strollwith his sweetheart with the precise reasonof making fun of a child."Oh," he said,"little green men."And then his girlfriend joined in, too."There's no such thing as space men," she said."There's no such thing."And then they both laughed. "Ha, ha, ha."I looked around.The street was entirely empty.I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.It was as though time had stopped.I did not know why they were teasing me.I looked into their strangely angry faces,and I remember wondering,are they wearing rubber masks?(Laughter)And what would be behind those rubber masks, if they were?Giant, almond-shaped, unblinking eyes?Slits for mouths?The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun,and then he made laser sounds."Kew, kew, kew --watch out."And they turned at once and walked away.The old man reached outhis knobbly clawfor the woman's hand,and found it, and left me alone.Now, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding --a strange encounter among humans.Maybe it was swamp gas, but --(Laughter) --I know what I saw.Close encounter two: Brookline, Massachusetts, 1984.I went to see the movie "Dune,"and a girl talked to me. Now, on its face --(Laughter) --this is impossible on its face, I realize --but it is absolutely true.It was opening night, naturally.I went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left.On my right was the girl in question.She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.I remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle,an Ace bandage, and she had crutches.She was very tall, I would say.I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior,but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school.I didn't know her name, and I never will.She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother,and they were talking about the novel, "Dune."They were both big fans, mother and daughter --very unusual.They were talking about how their favorite characterswere the giant sandworms.And then it got stranger.That's when she turned to me and said,"Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?"(Laughter)First of all, I was embarrassedbecause I had not read the novel "Dune" at that time.I was merely a connoisseur of moviesfeaturing desert planets, as I still am.(Laughter)But it was also the tone of how she asked the question:apropos of nothing, like she didn't even care about the answer,as though she just wanted to talk to me.I did not know what to say. I said, "Yes."I did not even turn my head.The movie began.I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of "Dune,"in which all of the characterswere sexy and deformed at the same time.(Laughter)There was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator,which was a kind of giant, floating fetus-creaturethat lived in a giant tank with this orange mistof psychedelic spiceswirling around him,allowing him to bend space and time.He could never leave the tankor interact with the outside world.He had become, in his isolation,so deformed and so sexy,that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radioto the outside world, and could never touch them.I mean, I liked him a lot better than the sandworms.The sandworms were fine, but your favorite character?Please.When the movie ended,everyone seemed very happyto get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible.Except for the girl.As I walked out, her pace slowed.Perhaps it was the crutches,but it seemed --(Laughter) --it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again.When I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous,but I can only come to the conclusionthat it was what, in the alien abductee community,they call a "screen memory":a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brainto cover up some trauma -- say, of being kidnappedand flown off to a sex pyramid.(Laughter)And so I sure am gladI did not slow down to talk to her.I sure am glad I never saw her again.Close encounter three: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,1989.In the mid-to-late '80s,the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called "Communion,"in which he described his own lifelong experiencesbeing abducted by aliens.And he also described the phenomenon known in this communityas "lost time,"where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become awarethat he could not remember the previous ten minutes,or the previous ten hours, or the previous ten days.And would come to the conclusion that that was when the alienswere taking him and giving him rectal probes.(Laughter)This book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.This image by Ted Joseph was from that book,and was his, sort of, police sketchof what the creatures looked likethat Whitley Strieber had described to him.And it was so successful that they made it into a movie.And in 1989, the way I remember it,I was in Philadelphiavisiting my girlfriend, and we decided,apropos of nothing, to go see this movie.And the way I remember it, the movie featured these details.One: Whitley Strieberwas played by Christopher Walken.Two: the alien was played by a rubber puppet.(Laughter)Three: there was a surprisingly longsequence of the film in which the rubber puppetgives Christopher Walken a rectal probe.Four: this was being shownin a regular movie theater in Center City, Philadelphia.Five: all of which is to say,they made a movie out of the book, "Communion,"and it starred Christopher Walken.Does something seem strange about this to you?Something odd? Something off? Something wrong with this picture?Think about it. Yes. The answer is:I had a girlfriend. What?(Laughter)How did this happen? When did this happen?I remember walking out of the theaterand becoming suddenly aware of this fact,as we walked hand in hand,and pondering these very same questions.And to this day, I have no answer for you.Close encounter four: the Algarve,Portugal, 1991.Some years later, I and this woman --we'll call her "Catherine Fletcher" --(Laughter) --went traveling through the south of Portugal together.We stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities,in tiny little hotels,and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verdeand watch the sun set and play checkers.What? Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this?We went to some topless beaches.Excuse me? No, not in my life.For what it's worth, we went to Sagres,which was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world.And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock,and the lead dog bit me on the ass,requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinicand receive an ass shot.Make of that what you will.(Laughter)Our last day in Portugal,we were in the district capital of Faro,and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beachone last time.Now, Faro is a bustling little city,and to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to takea bus and then a boat.And did I want to come with?But I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, "No."I remember what she looked like before she left.The freckles had grownand multiplied on her face and shoulders,clustering into a kind of a tan.A tan, we were both tan --is this true?Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.She was smiling.She was a single woman about to go alone into a country,not even speaking the language,to travel alone by bus and boatto go to a beach she did not knowor had never seen.I loved her, and then she went outinto that strange, alien land.It took me some time to come to my senses.I had my own "lost time" moment,where I woke up and suddenly realizedit was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,and she had not come back.Nervous, I went down to the street to look for her.Now, I did not speak Portuguese.I did not know where the beach was.I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,and the aliens had not given us that technology yet.(Laughter)I realized that the day would only havetwo possible outcomes:either Catherine would come back to the hotel,or she would never come back to the hotel.And so I sat down to wait.I did not watch the skies, but the very end of the streetwhere the buses and cars and pedestriansand little scooters were moving along.And I watched those constellations shift,hoping that they would part and I would see her face.It was at that moment,in that very small town of 30,000 or so,that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universeand the searching we might do in it.And that's when the Liberians came along.Five young men -- all laughing, happy, traveling together,coming back to this hotel where they were staying.One of them was named Joseph, and he asked mewhat was I doing, and I explained.And he said, "Don't worry." He was sure that Catherine would be safe.But he did not seem so very sure,for he sat down to wait with me.And for the next two hours, they all waited with me:taking turns, going up to their room, coming back,telling me jokes, distracting me.Two hours, they gave me a message.We are not alone.And then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight,I turned and looked down the street.The stars aligned, and she came back.She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.Neither did the Liberians,although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughteras they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their roomand left us alone in the street, holding hands.An event like this leaves a scar on the memory,much like a piece of alien technologythat has been inserted into your buttocksby a "Portuguese doctor."(Laughter)And even now, a decade and a half later,even now that we are married,I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.And even though, I think you'll agree, it is probablethat during the time she was away,she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,I love her and wait for her still.Thank you for your kind attention.(Applause)

You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.And it comes in a male form, too --very glamorous.Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine,there actually is a little wine in there --and of course, always wears a tuxedo.But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning --one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,but also comes in other forms.A magazine?Well, it's certainly not this one.This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it's all about sex tips.Sex tips are not glamorous.And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm,is not glamorous either.But there is a glamour of industry.This is Margaret Bourke-White's --one of her pictures she did.Fantastic, glamorous picturesof steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.And there's the mythic glamourof the garage entrepreneur.This is the Hewlett-Packard garage.We know everyone who starts a business in a garageends up founding Hewlett-Packard.There's the glamour of physics.What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe,grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene --he has other kinds of glamour.And there is, of course, this glamour.This is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space --and not the alien-style glamour,but the nice, clean, early '60s version.So what do we mean by glamour?Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour meansis you can look in the dictionary.And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary,in this case the 1913 dictionary.Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning,and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.You had "a" glamour.It wasn't glamour as a quality -- you "cast a glamour."Glamour was a literal magic spell.Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today,but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsiesand to some extent, Celtic magic.And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century,it started to take on this other kind of deception --this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with,an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.But still, glamour is an illusion.Glamour is a magic spell.And there's something dangerous about glamourthroughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spellon you, it was not in your self-interest --it was to get you to act against your interest.Well of course, in the 20th century,glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.And this is Hedy Lamarr.Hedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous,all you have to do is sit there and look stupid." (Laughter)But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy --about whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it.There was a tremendous amount of technical achievementassociated with creating this Hollywood glamour.There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywoodand see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colorsdepending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.So you've got this highly stylized portrait of somethingthat was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star.And actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time --they call them false color.Glamour is a form of falsification,but falsification to achieve a particular purpose.It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.And it involves a great deal of technique.It's not -- glamour is not something --you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.There is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization,"and it's not just the case for people.Glamour doesn't have to be people.Architectural photography --Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration,took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.Architectural photography is extremely glamorous.It puts you into this special, special world.This is Alex Ross's comic book art,which appears to be extremely realistic,as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world.When you stack people in rows,the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground --but not in the world of glamour.What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurbin the table of contents of New York magazine,which was telling us that glamour is back --glamour is all about transcending the everyday.And I think that that's starting to get at what the corethat combines all sorts of glamour is.This is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.And I don't know who she is either,but this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.It's a very glamorous portrait.Why is it glamorous?It's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful --but that does not make you glamorous,that only makes you beautiful.She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent,and those are the central qualities of glamour.You don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.She's not looking away from you exactly,but you have to mentally imagine her world.She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher worldto which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquilwhile holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.Mel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" -- not glamorous.That's glamour:that's Michelangelo's "Pieta," where Mary is the same age as Jesusand they're both awfully happy and pleasant.Glamour invites us to live in a different world.It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant --that's why, often in these glamour shots,the person is not looking at the audience,it's why sunglasses are glamorous --but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.In some sense, there has to be something like us.So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent,omniscient -- too far above us.And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Marywill often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms.As I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people,but it has to have this transcendent quality.What is it about Superman?Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous,one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.Glamour is all about transcending this worldand getting to an idealized, perfect place.And this is one reason that modes of transportationtend to be extremely glamorous.The less experience we have with them,the more glamorous they are.So you can do a glamorized picture of a car,but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.The notion is that it's going to transport you,and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane,who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.The story is about where you're arriving,or thinking about where you're arriving.And this sense of being transportedis one reason that we have glamour styling.This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorousbecause we associate it with movies of that period, but because,in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.The same thing -- arches are very glamorous.Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous.I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorousbecause, to me, it captures the whole promiseof the academic contemplative life --but maybe that's because I went to Princeton.Anyway, skylines are super glamorous,city streets -- not so glamorous.You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.The horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.There are few things more glamorous than the horizon --except, possibly, multiple horizons.Of course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat --you just see the possibilities.In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance qualityof sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglionein his book, "The Book Of The Courtier."There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today,after a few centuries.And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art.It makes things look effortless.You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress --she just looks completely natural.And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies,how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.Of course, they covered that with make-up,because Lara Croft did all those same stunts --but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura."To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort":And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.Glamour is about editing.How do you create the sense of transcendence,the sense of evoking a perfect world?The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this --I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.We don't tell you all the grubby details.Now, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year.This is underneath Jeff's desk.This is what the real world of computers,lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.But if you look in a catalog --particularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home --it looks like this.There are no cords.Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail --you can usually figure out where they hid the cord.But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp,you will live in a world without cords. (Laughter)And the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptopor you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras,you don't get to live in the world without cords.You have to have mystery and you have to have grace.And there she is -- Grace.This is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.Part of the thing is that, in "Rear Window,"the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.Here's Hedy Lamarr again.And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorousbecause, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.Translucence is glamorous --that's why all these people wear pearls.It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent --not transparent, not opaque.It invites us into the worldbut it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person,maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot,because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.It has that sense of going up and away,and yet you never think about how you would really tripif you were -- particularly going down.And of course glass block has that sense of translucence.So, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasurebut glamour's really partly about meaning.All individuals and all cultures have idealsthat cannot possibly be realized in reality.They have contradictions,they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other --whatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purposeto our lives as cultures and as individuals.And the way we deal with that is we displace them --we put them into a golden world, an imagined world,an age of heroes, the world to come.And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.The white picket fence, the perfect house.The perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace,the perfect diamond ring.The perfect getaway in your perfect car.This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.The perfect office --again, no cords, as far as I can tell.And certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.I mean, there's no paper on the desk.We want this golden world.And some people get rich enough,and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense,they get to acquire their perfect world.Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is --I don't think accidentally -- in Art Deco style.That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.This is not always good, because what is your perfect world?What is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?Is it something important?"The Matrix" is a movie that is all about glamour.I could do a whole talk on "The Matrix" and glamour.It was criticized for glamorizing violence,because, look -- sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course,they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of thingsthat are impossible in the real world.This is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.This is from Soviet Union. Attractive.I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.You know, we're marching toward Utopia.I'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad.Because what they're doing is they're saying,your coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important.But actually, what's even more importantthan remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good?Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor.This is from "Triumph Of The Will" --brilliant editing to cut together things.There's a glamour shot.National Socialism is all about glamour.It was a very aesthetic ideology.It was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world,and ridding it of anything unglamorous.So glamour can be dangerous.I think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value.I'm not against glamour.But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamourand a way to broaden your appreciation of it.And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's adviceand confront the manipulation of it all,and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy,but also enjoy how it happens.And here's Hedy Lamarr.She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid,even though she thought she could look stupid.David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of thisvery glamorous painting is heightened if you think aboutthe fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash,which only took a fraction of a second to happen.There is a book out in the bookstore --it's called "Symphony In Steel,"and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.And that has a fascination.It's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal.There's a wonderful book called "Crowns"that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.And there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about,"As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats.They looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.But I also knew how hard they worked all week.Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow."And, actually, you get more appreciation for glamourwhen you realize what went into creating it.Thank you.

You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.And it comes in a male form, too --very glamorous.Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine,there actually is a little wine in there --and of course, always wears a tuxedo.But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning --one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,but also comes in other forms.A magazine?Well, it's certainly not this one.This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it's all about sex tips.Sex tips are not glamorous.And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm,is not glamorous either.But there is a glamour of industry.This is Margaret Bourke-White's --one of her pictures she did.Fantastic, glamorous picturesof steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.And there's the mythic glamourof the garage entrepreneur.This is the Hewlett-Packard garage.We know everyone who starts a business in a garageends up founding Hewlett-Packard.There's the glamour of physics.What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe,grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene --he has other kinds of glamour.And there is, of course, this glamour.This is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space --and not the alien-style glamour,but the nice, clean, early '60s version.So what do we mean by glamour?Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour meansis you can look in the dictionary.And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary,in this case the 1913 dictionary.Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning,and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.You had "a" glamour.It wasn't glamour as a quality -- you "cast a glamour."Glamour was a literal magic spell.Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today,but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsiesand to some extent, Celtic magic.And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century,it started to take on this other kind of deception --this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with,an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.But still, glamour is an illusion.Glamour is a magic spell.And there's something dangerous about glamourthroughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spellon you, it was not in your self-interest --it was to get you to act against your interest.Well of course, in the 20th century,glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.And this is Hedy Lamarr.Hedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous,all you have to do is sit there and look stupid." (Laughter)But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy --about whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it.There was a tremendous amount of technical achievementassociated with creating this Hollywood glamour.There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywoodand see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colorsdepending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.So you've got this highly stylized portrait of somethingthat was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star.And actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time --they call them false color.Glamour is a form of falsification,but falsification to achieve a particular purpose.It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.And it involves a great deal of technique.It's not -- glamour is not something --you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.There is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization,"and it's not just the case for people.Glamour doesn't have to be people.Architectural photography --Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration,took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.Architectural photography is extremely glamorous.It puts you into this special, special world.This is Alex Ross's comic book art,which appears to be extremely realistic,as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world.When you stack people in rows,the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground --but not in the world of glamour.What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurbin the table of contents of New York magazine,which was telling us that glamour is back --glamour is all about transcending the everyday.And I think that that's starting to get at what the corethat combines all sorts of glamour is.This is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.And I don't know who she is either,but this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.It's a very glamorous portrait.Why is it glamorous?It's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful --but that does not make you glamorous,that only makes you beautiful.She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent,and those are the central qualities of glamour.You don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.She's not looking away from you exactly,but you have to mentally imagine her world.She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher worldto which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquilwhile holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.Mel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" -- not glamorous.That's glamour:that's Michelangelo's "Pieta," where Mary is the same age as Jesusand they're both awfully happy and pleasant.Glamour invites us to live in a different world.It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant --that's why, often in these glamour shots,the person is not looking at the audience,it's why sunglasses are glamorous --but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.In some sense, there has to be something like us.So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent,omniscient -- too far above us.And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Marywill often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms.As I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people,but it has to have this transcendent quality.What is it about Superman?Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous,one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.Glamour is all about transcending this worldand getting to an idealized, perfect place.And this is one reason that modes of transportationtend to be extremely glamorous.The less experience we have with them,the more glamorous they are.So you can do a glamorized picture of a car,but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.The notion is that it's going to transport you,and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane,who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.The story is about where you're arriving,or thinking about where you're arriving.And this sense of being transportedis one reason that we have glamour styling.This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorousbecause we associate it with movies of that period, but because,in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.The same thing -- arches are very glamorous.Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous.I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorousbecause, to me, it captures the whole promiseof the academic contemplative life --but maybe that's because I went to Princeton.Anyway, skylines are super glamorous,city streets -- not so glamorous.You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.The horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.There are few things more glamorous than the horizon --except, possibly, multiple horizons.Of course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat --you just see the possibilities.In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance qualityof sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglionein his book, "The Book Of The Courtier."There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today,after a few centuries.And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art.It makes things look effortless.You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress --she just looks completely natural.And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies,how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.Of course, they covered that with make-up,because Lara Croft did all those same stunts --but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura."To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort":And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.Glamour is about editing.How do you create the sense of transcendence,the sense of evoking a perfect world?The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this --I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.We don't tell you all the grubby details.Now, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year.This is underneath Jeff's desk.This is what the real world of computers,lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.But if you look in a catalog --particularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home --it looks like this.There are no cords.Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail --you can usually figure out where they hid the cord.But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp,you will live in a world without cords. (Laughter)And the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptopor you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras,you don't get to live in the world without cords.You have to have mystery and you have to have grace.And there she is -- Grace.This is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.Part of the thing is that, in "Rear Window,"the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.Here's Hedy Lamarr again.And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorousbecause, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.Translucence is glamorous --that's why all these people wear pearls.It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent --not transparent, not opaque.It invites us into the worldbut it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person,maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot,because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.It has that sense of going up and away,and yet you never think about how you would really tripif you were -- particularly going down.And of course glass block has that sense of translucence.So, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasurebut glamour's really partly about meaning.All individuals and all cultures have idealsthat cannot possibly be realized in reality.They have contradictions,they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other --whatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purposeto our lives as cultures and as individuals.And the way we deal with that is we displace them --we put them into a golden world, an imagined world,an age of heroes, the world to come.And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.The white picket fence, the perfect house.The perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace,the perfect diamond ring.The perfect getaway in your perfect car.This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.The perfect office --again, no cords, as far as I can tell.And certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.I mean, there's no paper on the desk.We want this golden world.And some people get rich enough,and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense,they get to acquire their perfect world.Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is --I don't think accidentally -- in Art Deco style.That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.This is not always good, because what is your perfect world?What is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?Is it something important?"The Matrix" is a movie that is all about glamour.I could do a whole talk on "The Matrix" and glamour.It was criticized for glamorizing violence,because, look -- sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course,they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of thingsthat are impossible in the real world.This is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.This is from Soviet Union.

So, indeed, I have spent my lifelooking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive.Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning,thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.But when I try and think about what I've learnedabout the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering backto a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvardwith the great psychologist Erik Erikson.He taught us that the richest and fullest livesattempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms:work, love and play.And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other,is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age.Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication,is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement,but with serenity.So since I tell stories, let me look backon the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point --Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.As for that first sphere of work,I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggestsis that fierce ambition is a good thing.He had a huge ambition.But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame --what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in lifeso that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.Even as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams.He somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farmfrom which he was born.No schooling was possible for him,except a few weeks here, a few weeks there.But he read books in every spare moment he could find.It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bibleor "Aesop's Fables," he was so excited he couldn't sleep.He couldn't eat.The great poet Emily Dickinson once said,"There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away."How true for Lincoln.Though he never would travel to Europe,he went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England,he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal.Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.But there were so many losses in his early lifethat he was haunted by death.His mother died when he was only nine years old;his only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later;and his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22.Moreover, when his mother lay dying,she did not hold out for him the hopethat they would meet in an afterworld.She simply said to him,"Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return."As a result he became obsessed with the thoughtthat when we die our life is swept away -- dust to dust.But only as he grew older did he developa certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion --but followed by other cultures as well --that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life,you could live on in the memory of others.Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.And that worthy ambition became his lodestar.It carried him through the one significant depression that he sufferedwhen he was in his early 30s.Three things had combined to lay him low.He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd,not certain he was ready to marry her,but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.His one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinoisto go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died.And his political career in the state legislaturewas on a downward slide.He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room.And his great friend Speed went to his side and said,"Lincoln, you must rally or you will die."He said that, "I would just as soon die right now,but I've not yet done anything to make any human beingremember that I have lived."So fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature.He eventually won a seat in Congress.He then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice."Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said,"but some people are stronger in the broken places."So then he surprised the nation with an upset victoryfor the presidency over three far more experienced,far more educated, far more celebrated rivals.And then when he won the general election,he stunned the nation even moreby appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet.It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought,"He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people."They said, "Why are you doing this, Lincoln?"He said, "Look, these are the strongestand most able men in the country.The country is in peril. I need them by my side."But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnsonmight have put it in less noble fashion:"Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out,than outside the tent pissing in."(Laughter)But it soon became clear that Abraham Lincolnwould emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team.For each of them soon came to understandthat he possessed an unparalleled array ofemotional strengths and political skillsthat proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé.For one thing, he possessed an uncanny abilityto empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.He repaired injured feelings that might have escalatedinto permanent hostility.He shared credit with ease,assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates,constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes.These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.(Applause)He refused to be provoked by petty grievances.He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights.And he expressed his unshakeable convictionsin everyday language, in metaphors, in stories.And with a beauty of language -- almost as ifthe Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a childhad worked their way into his very soul.In 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed,he brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House,and remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad.And he, pointing to the Proclamation, said,"I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized."But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamationhis own hand was numb and shakingbecause he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.So he put the pen down.He said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.But if I sign with a shaking hand,posterity will say, 'He hesitated.'"So he waited until he could take up the penand sign with a bold and clear hand.But even in his wildest dreams,Lincoln could never have imaginedhow far his reputation would reach.I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer,Leo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.And in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently madeto a very remote area of the Caucasus,where there were only wild barbarians,who had never left this part of Russia.Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst,they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history.So he said, "I told them about Napoleonand Alexander the Great and Frederick the Greatand Julius Caesar, and they loved it.But before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said,'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all.We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder,who laughed like the sunrise,who came from that place called America, which is so far from here,that if a young man should travel there,he would be an old man when he arrived.Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'"He was stunned.He told them everything he could about Lincoln.And then in the interview he said, "What made Lincoln so great?Not as great a general as Napoleon,not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great."But his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree,in the integrity of his characterand the moral fiber of his being.So in the end that powerful ambitionthat had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized.That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself,to go through that string of political failuresand the darkest days of the war.His story would be told.So as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love --encompassing family, friends and colleagues --it, too, takes work and commitment.The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life,when I helped him on his memoirs,was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit ofwork, power and individual success,that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources leftto get him through the daysonce the presidency was gone.My relationship with him began on a rather curious level.I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old.We had a big dance at the White House.President Johnson did dance with me that night.Not that peculiar --there were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted meto work directly for him in the White House.But it was not to be that simple.For in the months leading up to my selection,like many young people, I'd been activein the anti-Vietnam War movement,and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson,which unfortunately came out in The New Republictwo days after the dance in the White House.(Laugher)And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.(Laughter)So I was certain he would kick me out of the program.But instead, surprisingly, he said,"Oh, bring her down here for a year,and if I can't win her over, no one can."So I did end up working for him in the White House.Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs,never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with.I like to believe it was because I was a good listener.He was a great storyteller.Fabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories.There was a problem with these stories, however,which I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true.But they were great, nonetheless.(Laughter)So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales.But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends,even when I didn't have any at all.Everything was working perfectly,until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship.Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake,conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson.And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth --all the romantic trappings.And he started out,"Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... "And my heart sank.And then he said,"You remind me of my mother."(Laughter)It was pretty embarrassing, given what was going on in my mind.But I must say, the older I've gotten,the more I realize what an incredible privilege it wasto have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.A victor in a thousand contests,three great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.And yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.And because he was so sad and so vulnerable,he opened up to me in ways he never would havehad I known him at the height of his power --sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within methe drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure,that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.But it also brought home to me the lessonswhich Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of usabout the importance of finding balance in life.For on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have hadeverything in the world to feel good about in those last years,in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency;he had all the money he needed to pursueany leisure activity he wanted;he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city,sailboats, speedboats.He had servants to answer any whim,and he had a family who loved him deeply.And yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual successmeant that in his retirement he could find no solacein family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so largethat even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.As his spirits sagged, his body deteriorateduntil, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death.In those last years, he said he was so sadwatching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.He spoke with immense sadness in his voice,saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children,and their children in turn.But it was too late.Despite all that power, all that wealth,he was alone when he finally died --his ultimate terror realized.So as for that third sphere of play,which he never had learned to enjoy,I've learned over the yearsthat even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy --enough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music,or art, or literature, or any form of recreation,can provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment.So deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare,that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater,even during those dark days of the war.He said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on,for a few precious hours he could imagine himselfback in Prince Hal's time.But an even more important form of relaxation for him,that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy,was a love of -- somehow -- humor,and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produceas a sidelight to the sadness.He once said that he laughed so he did not cry,that a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey.His storytelling powers had first been recognizedwhen he was on the circuit in Illinois.The lawyers and the judges would travelfrom one county courthouse to the other,and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town,they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.He would stand with his back against a fireand entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales.And all these stories became part of his memory bank,so he could call on them whenever he needed to.And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.One of his favorite stories, for example,had to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.And as Lincoln told the story,Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war.And the British people were still upsetabout losing the Revolution,so they decided to embarrass him a little bitby putting a huge picture of General Washingtonin the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.They figured he'd be upset about the indignityof George Washington being in an outhouse.But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all.And so they said, "Well, did you see George Washington in there?""Oh, yes," he said, "perfectly appropriate place for him.""What do you mean?" they said."Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shitfaster than the sight of General George Washington."(Laughter)(Applause)So you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting --and he had hundreds of these stories --you would have to relax.So between his nightly treks to the theater,his story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humorand his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry,he found that form of play which carried him through his days.In my own life, I shall always be gratefulfor having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.Which allows me, from the beginning of spring trainingto the end of the fall,to have something to occupy my mind and heartother than my work.It all began when I was only six years old,and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping scorewhile listening to baseball games --so that when he went to work in New York during the day,I could record for him the history of that afternoon'sBrooklyn Dodgers game.Now, when you're only six years old,and your father comes home every single nightand listens to you -- as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail,recounted every single play of every inningof the game that had just taken place that afternoon.But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.It makes you think there's something magic about historyto keep your father's attention.In fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative artfrom those nightly sessions with my father.Because at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out,"The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!"Which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.(Laughter)So I finally learned you had to tell a storyfrom beginning to middle to end.I must say, so fervent was my loveof the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those daysthat I had to confess in my first confessiontwo sins that related to baseball.The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella,came to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island,just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion.And I was so excited --first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field.But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church.When you are brought up as a Catholic, you thinkthat if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church,you'll be struck dead at the threshold.So I went to my father in tears, "What are we going to do?"He said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship.It's not a sin."But as I left that night, I was certain that somehowI'd traded the life of my everlasting soulfor this one night with Roy Campanella.(Laughter)And there were no indulgences around that I could buy.So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession.I told the priest right away.He said, "No problem. It wasn't a religious service."But then, unfortunately, he said, "And what else, my child?"And then came my second sin.I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church,wishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.And he said, "To whom did you wish harm?"And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees playerswould break arms, legs and ankles --(Laughter)-- so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.He said, "How often do you make these horrible wishes?"And I had to say, every night when I said my prayers.(Laughter)So he said, "Look, I'll tell you something.I love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do,but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen.""Oh yes," I said.But luckily, my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest!(Laughter)Well, though my father died of a sudden heart attackwhen I was still in my 20s,before I had gotten married and had my three sons,I have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys.Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.,I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Bostonand became an irrational Red Socks fan.And I must say, even now, when I sit with my sonswith our season tickets,I can sometimes close my eyes against the sunand imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father,watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below:Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider.I must say there is magic in these moments.When I open my eyes and I see my sonsin the place where my father once sat,I feel an invisible loyalty and lovelinking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see,but whose heart and soul they have come to knowthrough all the stories I have told.Which is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history,allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past.Allowing me to learn from these large figuresabout the struggle for meaning for life.Allowing me to believe that the private peoplewe have loved and lost in our families,and the public figures we have respected in our history,just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe,really can live on, so long as we pledgeto tell and to retell the stories of their lives.Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today.(Applause)Thank you.

I grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in thevery, very north end of it there,where it's absolutely freezing cold.This was me running around in the back garden mid-summer.(Laughter)I couldn't pick a career.In Ireland the obvious choice is the military,but to be honest it actually kind of sucks.(Laughter)My mother wanted me to be a dentist.But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.So I actually went to school in Belfast,which was where all the action happened.And this was a pretty common sight.The school I went to was pretty boring.They forced us to learn things like Latin.The school teachers weren't having much fun,the sports were very dirty or very painful.So I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.And I was actually rowing for my school hereuntil this fateful day, and I flipped over right in frontof the entire school.And that was the finishing post right there.(Laughter)So this was extremely embarrassing.But our school at that time got a grant from the government,and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3DZ --and they left the programming manuals lying around.And so students like myself with nothing to do,we would learn how to program it.Also around this time, at home,this was the computer that people were buying.It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.Actually I'm just going to pause for one second,because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED --you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair.So I brought a picture with big hair.(Laughter).I just want to get that out of the way.So after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly namedSinclair ZX81.(Laughter)And -- you see the picture at the bottom?There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.That's what they thought they had built it for.The reality is we got the programming manualand we started making games for it.We were programming in BASIC,which is a pretty awful language for games,so we ended up learning Assembly languageso we could really take control of the hardware.This is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair,and he's showing his machine.You had this same thing in America,it was called the Timex Sinclair1000.To play a game in those days you had to have an imaginationto believe that you were really playing "Battlestar Galactica."The graphics were just horrible.You had to have an even better imagination to play this game,"Death Rider."But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves.They started making their own video games.This is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding,so males choose the lucky rabbit.It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K,which was quite the leap.And if you're wondering how much 16K is,this eBay logo here is 16K.And in that amount of memory someone programmeda full flight simulation program.And that's what it looked like.I spent ages flying this flight simulator,and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it.Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer.He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe.He's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he'ssmiling in this photograph.So I went on for the next 20 years or somaking a lot of different games.Some of the highlights were things like "The Terminator,""Aladdin," the "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles."Because I was from the United Kingdom,they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children,so they decided to call it hero instead.I personally preferred the Spanish version,which was "Tortugas Ninja."That was much better.(Laughter)Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industryand Hollywood to actually work together on something --instead of licensing from each other, to actually work.Now, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me,so I've done that.The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.It grows every year.Last year was the biggest year.By 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry.By 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion.43 percent of gamers are female.So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware.The average age of gamers?Well, obviously it's for children, right?Well, no, actually it's 30 years old.And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.So 37 is our target audience.All video games are violent.Of course the newspapers love to beat on this.But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever,so it's just not true.Online gaming statistics.I brought some stuff on "World of Warcraft." It's 5.5 million players.It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer,making the publisher about another 275 million.The game costs about 80 million dollars to make,so basically it pays for itself in about a month.A player in a game called "Project Entropia"actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars.You have to remember that this is not a real island.He didn't actually buy anything, just some data.But he got great terms on it.This purchase included mining and hunting rights,ownership of all land on the island, and a castlewith no furniture included.(Laughter)This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually.And what's interesting about it is the market was actually createdby the gamers themselves.They found clever ways to trade itemsand to sell their accounts to each otherso that they could make money while they were playing their games.I dove onto eBay a couple of days agojust to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items.I liked this one the best:a level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars.It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it.So as far as popularity of games,what do you think these people are doing here?It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeleslistening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music.That's what the show looks like.You would expect it to be cheesy, but it's not.It's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert.And the people that went there absolutely loved it.What do you think these people are doing?They're actually bringing their computers so they can play gamesagainst each other.And this is happening in every city around the world.This is happening in your local cities too,you're probably just not aware of it.Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years agohere just to show how video game graphics have been improving.I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.But what I want you to do is to try to understand it.We're on this curve, and the graphics are gettingso ridiculously better.And I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007.But I want you to try and think about what games could look like10 years from now.So we're going to start that video.Video: Throughout human history people have played games.As man's intellect and technology have evolvedso too have the games he plays.(Music)(Applause)David Perry: The thing again I want you to think about is,don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is.Think about that's where we are right now,and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continueto get better.This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to drawif you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today.You need to be really an incredible artist.And once we get enough of those guys, we're going to wantmore fantasy artists that can create placeswe've never been to before, or characters thatwe've just never seen before.So the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio.But if you were to go to a game developers conference,what they're all talking about is emotion, purpose,meaning, understanding and feeling.You'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.I came across a student who's absolutely excellentat expressing himself, and this student agreedthat he would not show his video to anybody untilyou here at TED had seen it.So I'd like to play this video.So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are.Video: I, like many of you, live somewhere betweenreality and video games.Some part of me -- a true living, breathing person --has become programmed, electronic and virtual.The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasyhas finally begun to crumble.I'm a video game addict and this is my story.(Music)In the year of my birththe Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development.I played in the backyard, learned to read,and even ate some of my vegetables.Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos.But as was the case for most of my generation,I spent a lot of time in front of the TV.Mr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior,and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedlyleft their mark on me.When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo,whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactiveelectronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me.At some point something clicked.(Music)With the combination of simple, interactive storiesand the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendobecame more than just an escape.It became an alternate existence, my virtual reality.(Music)I'm a video game addict, and it's not because ofa certain number of hours I have spent playing,or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level.It is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space,and video games had begun to erode my own understandingof what is real and what is not.I'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality,I still crave more.(Music)From an early age I learned to invest myself emotionallyin what unfolded before me on screen.Today, after 20 years of watching TV geared to make me emotional,even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes.I am just one of a new generation that is growing up.A generation who may experience much more meaningthrough video games than they will through the real world.Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap,a point where game worlds will look and feel just as realas the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV.And while my sense of free will in these virtual worldsmay still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life.Play enough video games and eventually you willreally believe you can snowboard, fly a plane,drive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.I know I can.Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it,video games actually allow us to become part of the machine.They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive,downloaded, streaming, HD reality.We are interacting with our entertainment.I have come to expect this level of interaction.Without it, the problems faced in the real world --poverty, war, disease and genocide -- lack the levity they should.Their importance blends into the sensationalized dramaof prime time TV.But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics,the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound.It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.I have fought in wars, feared for my own survival,watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feelmore real than any textbook or any news story.The people who create these games are smart.They know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad.Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.A well-designed video game will seamlesslyweave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience.As one becomes more experiencedthe awareness of physical control melts away.I know what I want and I do it.No buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.I know violent video games make my mother worry.What troubles me is not that video game violenceis becoming more and more like real life violence,but that real life violence is starting to look more and morelike a video game.(Music)These are all troubles outside of myself.I, however, have a problem very close to home.Something has happened to my brain.(Music)Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holdsall of our gut instincts, the things we know to dobefore we even think.While some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned,and all of them are hardwired into our brains.These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds.Only in recent years has the technology behind video gamesallowed for a true overlap in stimuli.As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physicsin the same cities and doing many of the same thingswe once did in real life, only virtually.Consider this --my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.In all my driving games, I've driven a total of 31,459 miles.To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game.The sensory cues are very similar.It's a funny feeling when you have spent more timedoing something on the TV than you have in real life.When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is,this is almost as beautiful as my games are.For my virtual worlds are perfect.More beautiful and rich than the real world around us.I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are,but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetitionon a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.Today I believe Big Brother would find much more successbrainwashing the masses with video gamesrather than just simply TVs.Video games are fun, engaging, and leave your braincompletely vulnerable to re-programming.But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad.Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other,or helps us to understand the problems we're all facingin the real world.There is a potential to do good as well.It is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirrorthe real world we live in, that game developers realizethat they have tremendous responsibilities before them.I'm not sure what the future of video games holdsfor our civilization.But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlapthere is a greater and greater potential for other peopleto feel the same way I do.What I have only recently come to realizeis that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotionit is the power to break down reality that is so fascinatingand addictive to me.I know that I am losing my grip.Part of me is just waiting to let go.I know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become,or how flat the real world may seem to us,that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching usand how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.(Applause)DP: Wow.(Applause)I found that video very, very thought provoking,and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.And what was interesting about it is the obvious choicefor me to talk about was graphics and audio.But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well.Video games give an awful lot of other things too,and that's why people get so addicted.The most important one being fun.The name of this track is "The Magic To Come."Who is that going to come from?Is it going to come from the best directors in the worldas we thought it probably would?I don't think so.I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up nowthat aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past.They're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created.The same with students or highly creative people,writers and people like that.As far as colleges go, there's about 350 colleges around the worldteaching video game courses.That means there's literally thousands of new ideas.Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.There's nothing worse than having to listen to someonetry and pitch you a really bad video game idea.(Laughter)Chris Anderson: You're off, you're off. That's it.He's out of time.DP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me.CA: Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though.(Laughter)DP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class.The school is closed; they're coming back at midnightbecause they want to pitch their video game ideas.I'm sitting at the front of the class,and they're actually pitching their ideas.So it's hard to get students to come back to class,but it is possible.This is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old.And I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experiencein the video game world?And as I've shown here, we have the audience.She's never going to know a world where you can't press a buttonand have millions of people ready to play.You know, we have the technology.She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren'tstunning and really immersive.And as the student video showed, we can impact and move.She's never going to know a world where video gamesaren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry.I just hope she likes video games.(Laughter)So, my closing thought.Games on the surface seem simple entertainment,but for those that like to look a little deeper,the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiersto creative minds that like to think big.Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED?Thank you.Chris Anderson: David Perry. That was awesome.

I'm a, or was, or kind of am a toy designer.And before I was a toy designer, oh, I was a mime, a street mime, actually.And then I was an entertainer, I guess.And before that, I was a silversmith, and before that, I was --I was out of the house at about 15 and a half,and I never wound up going into college.I didn't really -- I didn't see the point at the time.I do now, after learning about all the quantum stuff.(Laughter)It's really cool.Anyway, I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design,at least from my small aperture of the world.This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design.I'm in my garage, making weird stuff.And then you go to these toy companiesand there's some guy across the table,and he goes, "Pass. Pass. Pass."You know, you think it's so cool, but they --anyway, I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in.This is the name of my company, Giving Toys.So I used to work at Mattel, actually.And after I left Mattel, I started all these hamburger makers,and then got the license to make the maker.So this is a hamburger maker thatyou take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there, and it makes --and this is a French fry maker, little, tiny food you can eat.I beat up the pasta maker to make that.Then this is a McNugget maker, I think.This, now that's the McNugget maker,and this is a -- this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie.And let's see, you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar,and then you eat, and you eat, and you eat, and you --she's about 300 pounds now.No, she's not, she's beautiful.This is how they looked when they came out at the end.These are a -- this is like a 15 million dollar line.And it got me through some -- I didn't make any royalties on this, but it got me through.Next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff.That was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold.This is a squishy head, for no apparent reason.This is some effects that I did for "Wig, Rattle and Roll."That was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back.That paid the rent for about a month.This is a walking Barbie -- I said, "Oh, this is it!"And they go, "Oh, that's really nice," and out it goes.So this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these.They fight, they get back up, you know? Wouldn't this be cool?And they made it into a toy, and then they dropped it like a hot rock.They're pretty cool.This is a-- we're doing some flight-testingon my little pug, seeing if this can really grab.It does pretty good.I'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin.It's how they, see, have those album things -- kids don't know what they are.This is a clay maker.You know, I said -- I went to Play-Doh,and said, "Look, I can animate this."They said, "Don't talk to us about Play-Doh."And then, I made a Lego animator.I thought, this would be so great!And you know, Lego -- don't take Legos to Lego.That's the answer. They know everything about it.Then I started doing animatronics.I loved dinosaurs.I used to be in the film business, kind of,and actually, Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was, like, 12,and anyway, so then they said, "No, you have to make two and they have to fight."You know, how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur?This is me using [unclear] or 3-D Studio, back in the '80s.That's David Letterman.You can see how old this stuff is.That's my youngest cousin.This is a segment called, "Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas."We had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair.My career basically peaked here.And in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show.This is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor.So this is a -- I used to kind of be an actor.And I'm really not very good at it.But the -- this is a guy named Dr. Yatz,who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering.And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there.And over to the left is a view master of the CD-ROM.And a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot.This is a -- you can see the little window there.You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom.You see the keyboard strapped to my wrist.Way ahead of my time here.(Video) I'm getting dizzy ...Narrator: I love toys!Caleb Chung: That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys.OK, so, so that was a, that was the first kind of a --that was the first batch of products.Most of them did not go.You get one out of 20, one out of 30 products.And every now and then, we do something like a,you know, an automated hair wrap machine, you know,that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out, and --and we'd make some money on that, you know. And we'd give it out.But eventually, we left L.A., and we moved to Idaho,where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet.And I started working on this project-- oh, I have to tell you about this real quick.Throughout this whole thing, making toys,I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science.There's some kind of a blend that happensthat allows, you know, to find innovation.And I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbolthat means something, to me anyway.And so, art and science have a kind of dynamic balance,that's where I think innovation happens.And actually, this is, to me, how I can come up with great ideas.But it's not how you actually get leverage.Actually, you have to put a circle around that, and call it business.And those three together, I think, give you leverage in the world.But moving on.So, this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale.As he said, I was co-inventor of the Furby.I did the body and creature -- well, you'll see.So by way of showing you this, you can kind ofget an understanding of what it is to,hopefully, try to create robotic life forms, or technologythat has an emotional connection with the user.So this is my family.This is my wife, Christi, and Abby, and Melissa,and my 17-year-old now, Emily, who was just a pack of trouble.All right, there's that robot again.I came out of the movie business, as I said,and I said, let's make these animatronic robots.Let's make these things.And so I've always had a big interest in this.This one actually didn't go anywhere,but I got my feet wet doing this.This is a smaller one, and I have a little moving torso on there.A little, tiny guy walks along. More servo drives,lots of servo hacking, lots of mechanical stuff.There's another one.He actually has skeletor legs, I think, he's wearing there.Oh, this is a little pony, little pony -- very cute little thing.The point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces.So the challenge was -- I worked for Microsoft for a little bit,working on the Microsoft Barney.And this is a -- you know, the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear.And, you know, they had lots, just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need, I thought.And then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehousefull of this stuff and see if they sell.So it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company.But anyway, a friend of mine and I, Dave Hampton,decided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism.What's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form?And that's our little, thirty-cent Mabuchi motor.And so, I have all these design books,like I'm sure many of you have.And throughout the books -- this is the first page on Furby --I have kind of the art and science.I have the why over here, and the how over there.I try to do a lot of philosophy, a lot of thinking about all of these projects.Because they're not just "bing" ideas;you have to really dig deep in these things.So there's some real pseudo-code over here,and getting the idea of different kind of drives, things like that.And originally, Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom.And then we said, well, you're going to feed him,and he needs to talk, and it got more complicated.And then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motorto make the eyes move, and the ears move,and the body to move, and the mouth to move.And, you know, I want to make it blinkand do all that at the same time.Well, I came up with this kind of linearexpression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well.Then I started to get a little more realisticand I have to start drawing the stuff.And there's my "note to self" at the top:"lots of engineering."So that turned out to be a little more than true.There's my first exploded view and all the little piecesand the little worm drive and all that stuff.And then I've got to start building it,so this is the real thing.I get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together.And that's my little workshop.And there's the first little cam that drove Furby.And there's Furby on the half shell.You can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor.I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic.So there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it.And there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby.No, it's a little robot on heroin or something, I think.(Laughter)So right now, you see, I love little robots.So my wife says, "Well, you may like it, but nobody else will."So she comes to the rescue.This is my wife Christi, who is just, you know,my muse and my partner for eternity here.And she does drawings, right?She's an actual, you know, artist.And she starts doing all these different drawingsand does color patterns and coloring books.And I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there.He didn't test so well, but I like him.And then she started doing these other images.At that time, Beanie Babies was a big hit,and we thought, we'll do a bunch of different ones.So here's a little pink one, a little pouf on his head.And here's -- this didn't do so well in testing either, I don't know why.There's my favorite, Demon Furby.That was a good one.Anyway, finally settled on kind of this kind of a look,little poufy body, a little imaginary character.And there he is, a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there.I actually went to Toys"R"Us, got a little furry cat,ripped it apart and made this.And since then, every time I come home from Toys"R"Uswith dolls or something, they disappear from my deskand they get hidden in the house.I have three girls and they just, they --it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there.(Laughter)So, a little tether coming off,it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes.It's just a little server control and I made a little video going:"Hi, my name's Furby, and I'm good,"you know, and then I'd reach my hand.He'd -- you can tickle him. When I put my hand up,"Ha, ha, ha, ha" and that's how we sold him.And Hasbro actually said, I meant Tiger Electronics at the time,said, "Yeah, we want to do this.We have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair,and we're going to hire you guys to do this."And so Dave and I got working.Mostly me, because it was all mechanics at this point.So now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuffI don't know how to do.And I started working with Solid Worksand a whole other group to do that.And we started --this was way back before there was really much SLA going on,not a lot of rapid prototyping.We certainly didn't have the money to do this.They only paid me, like, a little bit of money to do this,so I had to call a friend of a friendwho was running the GM prototype plant, SLA plant, that was down.And they said, "Yeah, well, we'll run them."So they ran all the shells for us, which was nice of them.And the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard.We snuck in on the weekend.And so we just had a disc of the files.But they have a closed system, so you couldn't print the things out on the machine.So we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors.And on the weekend we ran the parts for that.So this is how they come out close to the end.And then they looked like little Garfields there.Eight months later -- you may remember this,this was a -- total, total, total chaos.For a while, they were making two million Furbys a month.They actually wound up doing about 40 million Furbys.I -- it's unbelievable how -- I don't know how that can be.And Hasbro made about, you know, a billion and a half dollars.And I just a little bit on each one.So full circle -- why do I do this?Why do you, you know, try to do this stuff?And it's, of course, for your kids.And there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys.And she still actually has those.So I kind of retired, and we're already living in paradiseup in Boise, on a river, you know. Soand then I started another company called Toy Innovationand we did some projects with Mattel withactually with a lady who's here, Ivy Ross,and we did Miracle Moves Baby,made it in Wired magazine, did a bunch of other stuff.And then I started another company.We did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet,won "Best Innovations" at CES,but really I kind of slowed down and said, OK,I just ... After a while, I had this old tape of this dinosaur,and I gave it to this guy, and this other guy saw it,and then people started to want to do it.And they said they'd spend all this time.So I said, "OK, let's try to do this dinosaur project."The crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosauras much as we can with today's technology.And it's not really -- but as close as we can do.And we're going to try to really pull this off,intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive.Not a robot that kind of does, but let's really go for it.So I picked a Camarasaurus,because the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America.And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these.That's a juvenile.And so we actually went in.There's a book called "Walking on Eggshells,"where they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia.And the picture from the book, so when I --I told the sculptor to use this bump pattern, whatever you can to copy that.Very, very obsessive.There's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton,but the geometry's correct.And then I went in, and measured all the geometrybecause I figured, hey, biomimicry.If I do it kind of right, it might move kind of like the real thing.So there's the motor.And about this time, you know, all these other people are starting to help.Here's an example of what we did with the skull.There's the skull, there's my drawing of a skull.There's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue.There's the mechanism that would go in there,kind of a Geneva drive.There's some Solid Works versions of it.Here's some SLA parts of the same thing.And then, these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here.There's the skull, pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus.There's a photorealistic eye behind a lens.And there's kind of the first exploded view, or see-through view.There's the first SLA version, and it already kind of has the feel,it has kind of a cuteness already.And the thing about blending science and artin this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot,and then you go back and do the shape,and then you go back and forth.The servos in the front legs, we had to shape those like muscles.They had to fit within the envelope.There was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right.All the neck and the tail are cable,so it moves smoothly and organically.And then, of course, you're not done yet.You have to get the look for the skin.The skin's a whole another thing, probably the hardest part.So you hire artists, and you try to get the look and feelof the character.Now, this is not -- we're character designers, right?And we're still trying to keep with the real character.So, now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay.Now you start doing the sculpture for this.And you can see we got a guy from --who's just a fanatic about dinosaursto do the sculpting for us,down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything.And then more sculpting, and then more sculpting,and then more sculpting, and then more sculpting.And then, four years and 10 million dollars later,we have a little Pleo.John, do you want to bring him up?John Sosoka is our CTO, and is really the manthat's done most of the work with our 40-person company.I'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka.(Applause)So, thank you, John, thank you,and get back to work, all right, man?All right --(Laughter)-- no, it's very painful, so --(Laughter)-- these are little Pleos and you can probably see them.This -- I on purpose -- they go through life stages.So when you first get them, they're babies.And you -- more you have them, kind of the older they get,and they kind of learn through their behavior.So this one, this one's actually asleep, and -- hang on.Pleo, wake up. Pleo, come on.So this guy's listening to my voice here.But they have 40 sensors all over their body.They have seven processors, they have 14 motors,they have --but you don't care, do you?They're just cute, right? That's the idea, that's the idea.So you see -- hey, come on. Hey, did you feel that?There's something big and loud over here.Hey.(Laughter)That's good, wake up, wake up, wake up.Yeah, they're like kids, you know.You, yeah, yeah. Okay, he's hungry.I'll show you what he's been doing for, for four years.Here, here, here. Have some money, Pleo.(Laughter)There you go.That's what the investors think, that it's just --(Laughter)-- right, right. So they're really sweet little guys.And we're hoping that -- you know,our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards thingsin order to be more human.And we think we can help that out by havinglittle creatures that you can love.Now these are not robots, they're kind of lovebots, you know.They do change over time.But mostly they evoke a feeling of caring.And we have a -- I have a little something here.Now I do want to say that, you know, Ugobe is not there yet.We've just opened the door, and it's for all of you to step through it.We did include some things that are hopefully useful.Excuse me, Pleo.They -- he has a USB and he has a SD card,so it's completely open architecture.So anyone can plug him -- (Applause) -- thank you.This is John over here.Anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality.You can make him bipolar, or as someone said, a --(Laughter) --you can change his homeostatic drives, or whatever you want to call them.Kids can just drag and drop, put in new sounds.We -- actually, it's very hard to keep people from doing this.We have one animator who's taken it andhe's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial,and they're going, "Whassup," you know?(Laughter)You -- so it's -- yes, he likes that.So they're a handful. We hope you get one.I don't know what I'm missing to say,but as a last thing, I'd like to say is thatif we continue along this path, we are designing our children's best friends.And there's a lot of social responsibility in that.That's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving.And so I just -- I hope we all dream well.Thank you.(Applause)

[SHIT](Laughter)we had this wonderful guide,that comes with the design of animals.to spread the word of Christianity,to teach English to the natives.And they brought blackboards and chalk.and I just used some chalk on there.but they ran out of chalk.And this is a real crisis for them.And that's where the hyena comes in.scavenging animal in the world.and they'd pick up hyena shit.(Laughter)That's not what I'm here to talk about,What I'm here to talk about is the camel.When I started talking to Richardabout what I was going to speak about,I had recently come back from Jordan,(Laughter)And we were in the desert.105 degrees, one water bottle.Didn't look like it to me.the Jeep broke down.The guys got out, they put the hood up,About a hundred yards, it broke down.they flooded the engine.And we said, "We get out and walk?"We got out and walked, and sure enough,The guy went up and started dickering,and 10 dollars later, we had four camels.and they started galloping.About every 10 steps, they lean backand try to take a chunk out of your leg.(Laughter)So we kept on going,where a Jeep was supposed to meet us.we sort of clumsily get off,with this creature by this point,to take back to the States.So as we talked, Richard and I,So I did the next best thing.I went to the Washington Zoo.Pull its tail up; take a look in there.So, I got a National Geographic film crew.(Laughter)it is a scary, scary thing to behold.someone was smoking Bedouin high grade.(Laughter)So we got as close to it as possible,and I'm going to share this.Chris, if you want to roll this film.Then I'm going to show youDo you want to roll the film?(Adventure music)(Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows(Music continues)because I was around this camel all day.(Video) That's it, OK. No!KB: Ears?They use that to pinpoint sound.but there's the secondary --They don't. They store fat.is the fat is oxidized by their breathing.but they do have one, like, big nail.(Audience laughter)and make him more attractive.So, what the hell.(Audience laughter)you know what I mean, like, "Br-r-r!"We weigh our animals.But I would put him closer to 2,000.He's basically a walking mulch pile.But now, we're going to meet. Out!Out! Out!No.Out!(Music)(Applause)is that its penis points backwards.Now, what you also didn't see was that --and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki.In the pen beside him is Jasmine.Jasmine has been his mate for some time.And so we started thinking.I'm going to show you another film.But before I do, I just want to mentionthe ship of the desert.Can you roll it, please?Camel seeking cameland I'm very well ... hung.I'm TED Camel.The perfect desert machine.I'm smartly designed.Eyelashes that keep out sandA distinguished nose --and a groove that catches moisture.Amazingly full lips --Leathery chest pads that beat the heat.Short fur that keeps my skin cool.Long legs that allow heat to escape.And my hump?Ogden Nash once wrote:Here's a hint:Bactarian.Dromedary.I'm built to last.enough to fry an egg.But go without for more than a month.I'm powerful.Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo.Outrun a horse --And cover 26 miles on a good day.Camelot.I'm a good provider, too.Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God.No surprise.Tents and rugs are made of my hair.(Applause)we adapt our environment to us.not just this year, but in past years.But this creature that you've just seenthat is one of the most remarkable things.it has to adapt to the environment.Ricky, thank you very much for having me.RW: That's terrific. Thank you.

When I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought,"I gotta call my mother."I have a little Cuban mother -- she's about that big.Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.You still with me? (Laughter)I called her up."Hello, how're you doing, baby?""Hey, ma, I got to talk to you.""You're talking to me already. What's the matter?"I said, "I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people.""You're always talking to nice people, except when you wentto the White House.""Ma, don't start!"And I told her I was coming to TED, and she said,"What's the problem?"And I said, "Well, I'm not sure."I said, "I have to talk to them about stories.It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'"And she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up,it's entertainment when you tell it,and you're going to use a microphone."(Laughter)I said, "You're a peach, ma. Pop there?""What's the matter? The pearls of wisdomleaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?"(Laughter)Then my pop got on there.My pop, he's one of the old souls, you know --old Cuban man from Camaguey.Camaguey is a province in Cuba.He's from Florida.He was born there in 1924.He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors,and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos,our old Arawak ancestors.My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny,and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless."Papi, help.""I already heard your mother. I think she's right."(Laughter)"After what I just told you?"My whole life, my father's been there.So we talked for a few minutes, and he said,"Why don't you tell them what you believe?"I love that, but we don't have the time.Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.Great story is the art of letting go.So I'm going to tell you a little story.Remember, this tradition comes to usnot from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still,before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus,or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.Back then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.When Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.Have you been watching the commercials?Because every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once --to tell our story and have it heard.There are stories you tell from stages.There's stories that you may tellin a small group of people with some good wine.And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend,maybe once in your life.And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness.I'm not telling you that story.I'm telling you this one.It's called, "You're Going to Miss Me."It's about human connection.My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you toin that short character sketch,came to the United States one thousand years ago.I was born in 19 -- I forget, and I came to this countrywith them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.And Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.And in that little Southern town, I grew up,and grew up hearing these stories.But this story only happened a few years ago.I called my mom.It was a Saturday morning.And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal.It's delicious. It's savory.It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth --is that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know?That kind of food, yeah.This is the sensory part of the program, people.I called my mother, and she said, "Carmen, I need you to come, please.I need to go to the mall, and you know your father now,he takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go.I got an errand to run."Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you --Esther, my mother, had stopped driving several years ago,to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta.Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child,guys, naturally included flashing, blue lights.But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue,and when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport."Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?"(Spanish)"You don't speak English?""No."(Laughter)But eventually, every dog has its day,and she ended up in traffic court,where she bartered with the judge for a discount.There's a historical marker.But now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving.And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign upto take her to have her hair dyed, you know,that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit,you know, same color as the Buick.Anybody? All right.Little picks on the legs, where she does her needlepoint, and leaves little loops.Rockports -- they're for this.That's why they call them that.(Laughter)This is her ensemble.And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morningwhen I have a lot to do, but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing.I'm not going political on you but ... And so, I go to my mother's.I show up. She's in the carport.Of course, they have a carport.The kind with the corrugated roof, you know.The Buick's parked outside,and she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys."I got a surprise for you, baby!""We taking your car?""Not we, I."And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe.Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me.Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license.Issued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett.Blithering fucking idiots.(Laughter)I said, "Is that thing real?""I think so.""Can you even see?""I guess I must.""Oh, Jesus."She gets into the car -- she's sitting on two phone books.I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny.She's engineered an umbrella so she can -- bam! -- slam the door.Her daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream conein the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed."You coming? You no coming?""Oh, my God." I said, "OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?""Are you kidding me?""How are you doing it?""He's got to sleep sometime."And so we left my father fast asleep, because I knew he'd kill meif I let her go by herself, and we get in the car.Puts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse.I am buckling in seatbelts from the front.I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots.I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert.I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about?And she's whistling, and finally I do the kind ofbirth breathing -- you know, that one?Only a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right.And I said, "Ma, would you slow down?"Because now she's picked up the Highway 285,the perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now --there's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all.I said, "Ma, pick a lane!""They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them."And there she goes, right.I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped.So, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion.It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse, maybe."Mommy, I know you have been stopped.""No, no, what you talking about?""You have a license. How long have you been driving?""Four or five days.""Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?""I did not get a ticket."I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on.""OK, so I stopped at a lightand there's a guy, you know, in the back.""Would this guy have, like, a blue uniformand a terrified look on his face?""You weren't there, don't start.""Come on. You got a ticket?""No." She explained,"The man" -- I have to tell you as she did,because it loses something if I don't, you know --"he come to the window, and he does a thing like this,which tells me he's pretty old, you know.So I look up and I'm thinking,maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute.""Ma, are you still doing that?""If it works, it works, baby.So, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.'Well, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps."(Laughter)So he's talking to her, and at some point she says,"Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done.""Yeah? What?He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?""No, I look up, and the light, she change."(Laughter)You should be terrified.Now, I don't know if she's toying with me,kind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse --left paw, right paw, left paw, right paw --but by now, we've reached the mall.Now, you have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes?Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes.Audience: Yes.Carmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory,praying to that saint of perpetual availabilitythat as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along,some guy's going to turn on the brake lightsjust as you pull up behind him.But that doesn't happen most of the time, right?So, first I say, "Ma, why are we here?""You mean, like, in the car?""No, don't -- why are we here today?It's Saturday. It's the holidays.""Because I have to exchange your father's underwear."Now, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking,that you really have to -- you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren,this woman's mind.Do I want to walk in, because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor --enough metaphors for you? -- somewhere, I may not get out.But you know.(Laughter)"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now?And why? What is wrong with his underwear?""It will upset you.""It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?""No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot.I sent him to the store, which was my first mistake,and he went to buy underwear, and he bought the grippers,and he's supposed to buy the boxers.""Why?""I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children.""Oh, my God!"(Laughter)Olivia? Huh? Huh?By now, we have now crawled another four feet,and my mother finally says to me, "I knew it, I knew it.I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you? Right there."And she points out the passenger window, and I look out,and three -- three -- aisles down,"Look, the Chevy."You want to laugh, but you don't know --you're that politically corrected, have you noticed?Correct the other direction now, it's OK."Look, the Chevy -- he's coming this way.""Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait. The Chevy is three aisles away."She looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child,the cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly."I know that, honey. Get out of the carand go stand in the parking space till I get there."OK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no.How many of you once in your -- you were a kid, you were an adult --you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone?See, we're a secret club with a secret handshake.(Laughter)And years of therapy later, we're doing great.We're doing great. We're doing fine.Well, I stood up to her.This is -- you know, you'd think by now I'm -- and still holding?I said, "No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life."Of course, her comeback is, "When have I embarrassed you?"(Spanish)And she's still talking while she puts the car in park,hits the emergency brake, opens the door,and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age,she jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books,and then she walks around --she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her --around the front of the car.She has amazing land speed for a woman her age, too.Before I know it, she has skiddled across the parking lotand in between the cars, and people behind me, with that kind ofusual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah."I'm coming." Italian hand signals follow.I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books.This is new and fast, just so you -- are you still with us?We'll wait for the slow ones. OK.I start, and this is where a child says to me --and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before,because this is my laconic child.A brevity, brevity of everything with this child.You know, she eats small portions.Language is something to be meted outin small phonemes, you know -- just little hmm, hmm-hmm.She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen.She wields great power.She listens, because that's what people who tell stories do first.But she pauses occasionally and says,"How do you spell that? What year? OK."When she writes the expose in about 20 years,don't believe a word of it.But this is my daughter, Lauren, my remarkable daughter,my borderline Asperger's kid.Bless you, Dr. Watson.She says, "Ma, you got to look!"Now, when this kid says I got to look, you know.But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before.I grew up with this woman.I said, "Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't.""No, mama, you got to look."I got to look. You got to look.Don't you want to look?There she is.I look in bewildered awe:she's standing, those Rockports slightly apart, but grounded.She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it.She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer forceof her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like,"Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!"(Laughter)Ready? Brace yourselves. Here it comes."No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick.Honey, sit up so they can see you."Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.I finally come -- and now, it's the South.I don't know what part of the country you live in.I think we all secretly love stories.We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear.We want to curl up and say, "Tell it to me, tell it to me.Come on, honey, tell it to me."But in the South, we love a good story.People have pulled aside,I mean, they've come out of that queue line,they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks.Bets are placed."I'm with the little lady. Damn!"(Laughter)And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement.She is, after all, Cuban.I'm thinking, "Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break."Like you've never thought that in your life? Right? Yeah.I pull in. I put the car in park.Engine's still running -- mine, not the car.I jump out next to her going, "Don't you move!""I'm not going anywhere."She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy.I come out, and there's Esther.She's hugging the purse."Que?" Which means "what," and so much more.(Laughter)"Ma, have you no shame?People are watching us all around," right?Now, some of them you've got to make up, people.Secret of the trade.Guess what? Some of these stories I sculpt a little, here and there.Some, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there.She says this to me.After I say -- let me refresh you --"have you no shame?""No. I gave it up with pantyhose -- they're both too binding."(Laughter)(Applause)Yeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end.I'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder.Intrepid soul.I'm thinking, "This is my kid. How dare she?She jumped out of that car."That's OK, because my mother yells at me, I yell at her.It's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works.(Laughter)I turn around, but it's not a child. It's a young woman,a little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes.With her is a young man -- husband, brother, lover, it's not my job.And she says, "Pardon me, ma'am" -- that's how we talk down there --"is that your mother?"I said, "No, I follow little old women around parking lotsto see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!"The boy, now, he says. "Well, what my sister meant" --they look at each other, it's a knowing glance -- "God, she's crazy!"I said, (Spanish), and the young girl and the young boy say,"No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing."I said, "Look, please, let me take care of her, OK,because I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon,you know, you just want to handle her really gingerly."And the girl goes, "I know, but, I mean, I swear to God,she reminds us of our mother."I almost miss it.He turns to her on the heel of his shoe.It's a half-whisper, "God, I miss her."They turn then, shoulder to shoulder, and walk away,lost in their own reverie.Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw.And I turn to Esther, who's rocking on those 'ports, and says,"You know what, honey?""What, ma?""I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about 14, 15 more years,if you're lucky, but after that, honey, you're going to miss me."(Applause)

We really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children.If we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve.They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them.And we, as now the elite, parents, librarians, professionals, whatever it is,a bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offerwithin reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can.I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone.One is what's on the Boston Public Library.Carved above their door is, "Free to All."It's kind of an inspiring statement,and I'll go back at the end of this.I'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledgeto as many people as want to read it.And the idea of using technology is perfect for us.I think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks.It's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians,they were able to build the Library of Alexandria --the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.On the other hand, if you did, then great things happened.I think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something.And I'm going to try to argue only one point today:that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.So if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking,yeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published,everything that was ever meant for distribution,available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it.Yes, there's issues about how money should be distributed,and that's still being refigured out.But I'd say there's plenty of money, and there's plenty of demand,so we can actually achieve that.But I'm going to go over the technological, socialand sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision.And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website,the books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type,just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?If you wanted to put all of the published works onlineso that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it?Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the worldis the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.It is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.And a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte,so -- you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word.So a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes --it goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes.26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big,on spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.So for the cost of a house -- or around here, a garage --you can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress.That's pretty neat.Then the question is, what do you get?You know, is it worth trying to get there?Do you actually want it online?Some of the first things that people do is they make book readersthat allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun.And you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways.And you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop.There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfacesthat look a whole lot like books in certain ways,and you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute --still very book-like -- on your laptop.But I don't know, reading things on a laptop --whenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work.I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great.I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle.It's starting to be a little bit more specified.But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.I like the physical book.And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things,put them on the Net, and then download,print them and bind them, and end up with books again.And we sort of said, well, how hard is this?And it turns out to not be very hard.We actually went off to make a bookmobile.And a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish,a printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books.It costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book.And they actually come out kind of nice looking.You can actually get really good-looking booksfor on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.So the idea of -- this technology actually may end upputting books back in people's hands again.There are some other bookmobiles running around.This is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond -- Thoreau's works.This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services,for competing with the bookstore there.In India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around.And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria,the new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt.It was quite popularly attended.And kids starting to make their own books,and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned.So the idea of being able to use this technologyto end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro,but I think it still has its place.And being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopiansort of world,we thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda,we might have something.So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out.And we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley,fly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connectionat the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted,and get a program going making books in rural Uganda.And it actually -- so technologically, it works.What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books.So the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized,but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized.Everybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China.And so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment.There are some newer technologies for deliveringthat have happened that are actually quite exciting as well.One is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine.We have one of these things now. It's completely cool.It's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.And it's called the "Espresso Book Machine,"and in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book.Something else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain,beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand,is some of these new little screens that are coming out.And one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop.And I don't mean to steal any thunder here,but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader.So here's one of the beta units and you can --it actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader.And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it,and it turns out that 200 dots per inchmeans that you can put scanned books on them that look really good.At 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer.We're in good enough shape.You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about.But how do you go about doing all this scanning?So we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing.And there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation --sent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books.Well, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books.So we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India.The lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books.If you really care about books, you're going to scan them better,especially if they're valuable books.If they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them,because you could just buy another one,that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.But do things that you love.But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books --about 300,000 now -- doing very well.The Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.But we sent -- thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library.How do we go and do this, and how do we get it downso that it's a cost point that we could afford?And we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page.If it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up,make it so that you could download, print and bind it -- the whole shebang --we would have achieved something.So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents?And we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well --sort of these auto-page-turning things.If we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages.But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there.So anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scanner,and with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras,controlled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book,you can go and get the proper intonation.So you basically do a beautiful, respectful job.This is not a fax, this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful jobas you're going through these libraries.And we've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume.This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto.And actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage.People seem to love it.Yes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it.(Laughter)And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about,in languages that you can read.We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page.So 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book.The Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing --26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars, right?But a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start,and that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill.And what we've been able to do is get into libraries.We've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries,and libraries are up for having their books scanned.The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA,which is where we have one these scanning centers,and scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous.So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility.The thing we're missing is the 10 cents.If we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.We've scanned about 200,000 books.Now we're scanning about 15,000 books a month,and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.So all in all, that's going very well.And we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyrightinto the out-of-print world.So I think of -- we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff,and Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world.And I think we'll meet in the middle some place,and have the classic thing that you have,which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel.And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them.Exactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure.But anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library,the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other librariesthat are starting to participate in this program,to try out this model of where does a library stopand where does the bookstore take over.So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale.We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online.So, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a monthand we've got about 250,000 books online,counting all the other projects that are starting to add in.So what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp.The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal.Yes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions,but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.And then, there's business model issuesabout how to try to effectively market it and get it to people.But it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise,at least for the out of print and out of copyright,we suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online.Now let's go for audio, and I'm going to go through these.So how much is there?Well, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million diskshaving been published -- so 78s, long-playing records and CDs --or at least that's the largest archives of published materialswe've been able to sort of point at.It costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a diskand put it online, if you're doing things in volume.But we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny.This is a fairly heavily litigated area,so we've found that there are niches in the music worldthat aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system.And we've been starting to make these available by goingand offering shelf space on the Net.In the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right?If you give something to a charity or to the public,you get a pat on the back and a tax donation --except on the Net, where you can go broke.If you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed,you can lose your guitars or your house.This doesn't make any sense.So we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free,to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing,as long as nobody made any money. You could --concert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings,but concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead.And we get about two or three bands a day signing up.They give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day.We have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did,up on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material.So audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny.We've got a lot of collections now --a couple hundred thousand items -- and it's growing over time.Moving images: if you think of theatrical releases,there are not that many of them.As best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies everthat are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many.But half of those were Indian.But anyway, it's doable,but we've only found about a thousand of these things that --to be out of copyright.So we've digitized those and made those available.But we've found that there's lots of other types of moviesthat haven't really seen the light of day -- archival films.We've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films,all sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home.So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular.We're not quite a YouTube.We tended towards longer-term thingsand also things that people can reuse and make into new movies,which has just been great fun.Television comes quite a bit larger.We started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day.It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen.It's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television --Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC --24 hours a day.We only put one week up,which is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11,sort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see?CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets.Were they? Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out.How can we have critical thinking without being able to quoteand being able to compare what happened in the past?And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable,except by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job.So anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.So 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour,we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensivelyand have them up on the Net.And we've got, now, a lot of these materials.So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.So books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.Mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections.But we've worked through some of those,but we've still got real problems in Washington.Well, we're best known as the World Wide Web.We've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996.We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months.And actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet,which donates this collection to the Internet Archive.And it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource.And we've made a Wayback Machinethat you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were.If you go and search on something -- this is Google.com,the different versions of it that we have,this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release,and this is what it looked like at Stanford.So anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.Mostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this.If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one,which is probably best known for burning,is, don't just have one copy.So we've started to -- we've made another copy of all of thisand we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.So, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco,flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...so we're hedging our bets here.If we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.There's a political and social question out of this.Is all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private?There's some large companies that have seen this vision,that are doing large-scale digitization,but they're locking up the public domain.The question is, is that the world that we really want to live in?What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward?How do we go and have a world where we both have librariesand publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up?So universal access to all knowledge --I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind,like the man on the moon, or the Gutenberg Bible, or the Library of Alexandria.It could be something that we're remembered for,for millennia, for having achieved.And as I said before, I'll end with somethingthat's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library.Carnegie -- one of the great capitalists of this country --carved above his legacy, "Free to the People."Thank you very much.

Stephanie White: I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody.Can you tell everybody your name?Einstein: Einstein.SW: This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone "hi"?E: Hello.SW: That's nice. Can you be polite?E: Hi, sweetheart.SW: Much better. Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006,amongst all you modern-day Einsteins. In fact, she's very excited.E: Woo.SW: Yeah.(Laughter)Since we've arrived, there's been a constant buzz aboutall the exciting speakers here for the conference.This morning we've heard a lot of whispers aboutTom Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday. Einstein, did you hear whispers?E: [Squawks]SW: Yeah.(Laughter)Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk.A lot of her research goes on in caves, which can get pretty dusty.E: Achoo!SW: It could make her sneeze. But more importantly, her researchcould help Einstein find a cure for her never-ending scratchy throat.Einstein: [Coughs]SW: Yeah.(Laughter)Well, Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubesin his research at the microscopic level.Well, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hopingis that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut.E: Oh, my God! My God! My God!SW: Yeah. She would get really, really excited.(Laughter)That is one big peanut. Since Einstein is a bird,she's very interested in things that fly.She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.E: Ooh.SW: Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne.Einstein, would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship?E: [Spaceship noise]SW: Even if it doesn't have a laser?E: [Laser noise](Laughter)SW: Yeah, yeah. That was pretty funny, Einstein.Now, Einstein also thinks, you know, working in cavesand travelling through space -- it's all very dangerous jobs.It would be very dangerous if you fell down.E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat]SW: Yeah.(Laughter)Little splat at the end there. Einstein, did that hurt?E: Ow, ow, ow.SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work.E: [Squawks]SW: Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated.E: [Squawks]SW: Yeah, it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her jobeducating the public, she loves to take in the arts.If the children of the Uganda need another dance partner,Einstein could sure fit the bill, because she loves to dance.Can you get down?E: [Bobbing head] (Laughter)SW: Let's get down for everybody. Come on now.She's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh.Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.SW: Do your head now.E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.(Laughter)SW: Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some ariason her violin, and Einstein can sing along with some opera?E: [Operatic squawk]SW: Very good.(Laughter)Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer?Einstein, can you also sing?I know, you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing?E: La, la.SW: There you go. And, of course, if all else fails,you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta.E: [Squawks]SW: All right. Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier,but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem.E: What's the matter?SW: No, I don't have a problem. You have the problem, remember?You were saying that you were really embarrassed,because you're in love with a pirate?E: Yar.SW: There you go. And what do pirates like to drink?E: Beer.SW: Yeah, that's right. But you don't like to drink beer, Einstein.You like to drink water.E: [Water sound]SW: Very good. Now, really, she is pretty nervous.Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here,and she's pretty nervous to meet him.She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man.What do you say to a good-looking man?E: Hey, baby.(Laughter)SW: And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee.E: Yee haw.(Laughter)SW: And since she's such a big fan,she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March.And we didn't think he'd be in town then,so Einstein wanted to do something special for him.So let's see if Einstein will sing "Happy Birthday" to Al Gore.Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him?E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Again.E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Again.E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Big finish.E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Good job!(Applause)Well, before we wrap it up, she would like to give a shout outto all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo.Einstein, do you want to say "hi" to all the owls?E: Woo, woo, woo.SW: What about the other birds?E: Tweet, tweet, tweet.SW: And the penguin?E: Quack, quack, quack.SW: There we go.(Laughter)Let's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee?E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah.SW: Very good.(Laughter)What about a wolf?E: Ooooowww.SW: And a pig?E: Oink, oink, oink.SW: And the rooster?E: Cock-a-doodle-doo!SW: And how about those cats?E: Meow.(Laughter)SW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle.E: Grrrrr.(Laughter)SW: What about a skunk?E: Stinker.(Laughter)SW: She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous? Are you famous?E: Superstar.SW: Yeah. You are a superstar.(Laughter)Well, we would like to encourage all of you to do your partto help protect Einstein's animal friends, and to do your partto help protect their homes that they live [in].Now, Einstein does say it best when we ask her.Why do we want to protect your home?E: I'm special.SW: You are very special. What would you like to sayto all these nice people?E: I love you.SW: That's good. Can you blow them a kiss?E: [Kissing noise]SW: And what do you say when it's time to go?E: Goodbye.SW: Good job. Thank you all.(Applause)



john_walker_re_creates_great_performances

Ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.Not being the musicians -- the listeners, right?And we crave one thing,even though we kind of don't know it all the time.We crave to be in the room with the musicianthe day it was recorded, the day it was played.And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded.And it turns out the further back you go in history,the little rougher it sounds.And so we said, there's a solution to this.Let's separate the performance, as a thing,out from the recording, which was how it was made.You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day.But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers,and what instruments they were using.And it's the data hidden inside the recording.In order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and softwarethat runs in a very high resolution.And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Prothat looks like a nice grand piano there.And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things --but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computersand all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan.And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition.And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley,in terms of -- artificial intelligence terms.We have a process where we, you know,kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis.And we look at every single note,and all the attributes of those notes:how hard they were struck, and how they were held down,and how you move the fingers.So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers.And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you,but we never had a science behind these kinds of things.I'm going to start with Glenn Gould.He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year.Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century.He just got tired of being in front of an audience,and felt like -- a performing monkey was, in fact, his term.So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work.And Gould's specialty was playing Bach.His maybe most famous recordingwas something called "The Goldberg Variations."Bach only wrote themes and variations one time.He wrote some early pieces,but late in his life, in his mature period,he said, "Here's a theme -- 30 variations."In fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line.And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about,one in mono, and one in stereo.And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal,and as he got older, he said, "No, no, wait a minute.I'm going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal."What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version,and we'll play the first couple pieces of it.Glenn Gould, 1955.(Music)How about that?(Applause)So let me tell you a little bit how this was done.First of all, let me get you to the end step.This is -- we have a fairly complex processthat, you know, software and musicians and so on,but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter.We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other.So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard.And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording,and the left speaker is going to be the new recording,actually of an instrument just like that one,and I'm going to play them together at the same time.(Music)That's the original. [Unclear] That's the two together.(Music)Before "Jurassic Park,"there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right?So, in the video world,we've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior.And this is kind of another exampleof putting a science behind natural behavior.And then you heard the original.Ultimately, I started with the experience.And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.Lots of you can afford to buy one of these.But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound.And I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround,go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer.It's so involving compared to regular stereo.But if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones.And so on the same disk we have five recordings --Sony has five recordings.And you could listen in headphoneswith this thing called binaural recording.And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument,and it's got microphones where the ears are.And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this,you're inside of Glenn Gould's body.And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians,who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say,"I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano."Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano,and it feels like your fingers are making the decisionsand moving through the whole process.It's a game changer.Here's now something we know in spectacular quality.The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity.What you heard today was not perfect.It's an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt,and steel strings, and all these,and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity.So when you go into the recording session,you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to.There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side,and the dummy head and our recording engineersstanding around while we rebuild the piano.Without putting dates next to these things,step-by-step music will be turned into data,like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years.Audio has come very late to this game --I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from,which is how it was performed.And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool --they're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions,and you can't trick them very easily.Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.All right, there's this episode of "Star Trek."(Laughter)I get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there.The episode of "Star Trek" for me was James Daly played Methuselah --remember this one?And at some point he's dancing with his --and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967.Right, do you know where I'm going?And Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano,and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it.And then Spock turns round, he goes,"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes,and I don't believe this is one of them in the category."That's where I'm at.I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write.I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play.But I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data,that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things,again, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world.It's now coming in this world.The transition will be this one.It says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played.And I believe this is coming.Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data --no Glenn Gould in the room.But yet, it was human.And I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners.Every time you listen to a recording today,every time you take out your iPod and whatever,every time you listen to it, it's the same thing -- it's frozen.Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different?This morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song,the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday.You want to hear it played by different musicians.You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.We've seen all these "Star Treks," and they're all holodeck episodes as well.Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps.It's so amazing, it's so exciting.Every time I listen to that recording it's like, "Oh my God,I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening."It's a way better experiencethan whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form.And lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum.So I've really overshot my budget here.We made a new recording of himplaying in the Shrine Auditorium in September.It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.And I've got to tell you, we have this labwhere we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina,and we flew out to Los Angeles.And as the president of the company,I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were.That's a real uncomfortable feeling,when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team,and people are going to be sitting there in the audience.And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine,which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.And on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ...and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedalwas perfect, because he played it for that room on that day.And we captured all that data all over again.And I want you to hear that right now.And fortunately, it's right in here.This is an encore he used to do.It's one minute long.It's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor.(Music)(Applause)And that's just what the live audience did.(Applause)So thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.

My favorite topic isshortcuts.The master of shortcuts -- it's, of course, nature.But I will demonstratedifferent ways to getrid of difficulties and go to the point,to find an answerprobably much quicker than Arthur did. So,first,we violate the common sense,the logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this,90 degrees --all of you. Not you.All of you, right? Palm up.If you do this,the common, the logic says you must turn the wrist.Do you agree?Good.But I will first teach youa method, how you can do it withoutmoving the wrist, and then the shortcut.You can do it immediately, right?Hold the hand like this, palm up.Don't move the wrist. The wrist is --I doesn't speak very many, but I do the best, what I are.Right-molded you say, with iron?That was a joke, actually,and I --OK.Hold the hand palm up. Do this, don't move the wrist.Over the heart, don't move the wrist.Forward, don't move the wrist.Up, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist.And forward. Yeah.Now --(Laughter) --logic, logically,you have got to this position from this, without moving the wrist.(Laughter)Now, the shortcut.(Laughter)But it was six moves. Now with one move.I start here, palm down, you can follow.And then look at me.Yeah! (Laughter)One move. OK.So,that was the warming up.Now,I need an assistant.I talked to a nice girl before, Zoe.She has left. No! A big hand.(Applause)Good. Nice. And you can sit over there.One item here was water, right?And I will give my tributeto water.I think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about -- cheers.(Laughter)Beer has about --there's a lot of water in beer.(Laughter)So, nowI will demonstrate different ways ofmemorizing,control cards and so on.And I think I'll take off this one.I work with a specialmethod to do it, quick.I work withprecision -- oh, sorry --controlanda very powerful ...memory system, right?(Laughter)So,if --I have studied the poker. I like to gamble.Officially, I don't gamble but ...So, if we are --if we have five person,and I will do a five-handed poker game.Now I will interact. So a different personall the time, so not the same person can answer.So we have an agreement.Which one shall have a good poker hand?Which number? One, two, three, four or five? (Audience: Three.)Lennart Green: Three -- good.Andhere,I had a mat here to make it a little --the critical moment is -- sorry.If a card shark gathers the cards together,immediately when he --before he deals the card. Now,so I think, number three,I have arranged them in a full house.(Laughter)With queens and -- it's OK --queens and tens.That's a challenge. I like this.I will explain later. One, two, three, four, five.I start with three queens.So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards.And two tens.Yeah. Thank you.(Applause)But also the other hand is good, if all the other guys have good hands too.So these guys have actually a stronger hand --three aces and two kings.This guy beats them withfour of a kind, or deuce -- deuce.No reaction? That with even --OK, and this.These look in order, I'm probably -- hopefully --yeah. Three, four, five, six, sevenand ...But, of course, I will have the winning hand.Ten, jack,queen, king, ace.Yeah. So,good.(Laughter)So the hand that looks so good from the beginning,number three, at the endwas actually the lowest hand.Such life. Right?So, please mix them.Now, if you are interested, I will demonstrate someunderground techniques.Yes?I work withkind of estimation,shuffle tracking --ah, good.Impressive. Thank you.(Laughter)So, first,the first term is estimation.Here, I can estimate exactly how many cardsare put betweenmy royal flush.Of course, I can count the cards, but this is much quicker.Right? You agree.So here I have, actually --I know exactly where the cards are.So here, I can make a bet,and this is actually one of the points where I get my money.So here: 10, jack,queen, king, ace.OK.(Applause)Nextis a term --I do it quick. I call this stealing.So here, I thinkI know about where the cards are.I will spread the cards and you'll say stop,when I point to them, right. Point, say stop.Zoe: Stop.LG: Here -- you see some are missing?And that's the stealing cards, which I did.(Laughter)OK.Now, another term called shuffle tracking.Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards,even if another person shuffles.This is a little risky.So -- because if you look, now, I can still see it.You agree? But if you square --square, and shuffle,and then a cut.So here,to follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin --ah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK.Come to -- no, no, no, no.I'm joking, yeah?Any style -- yeah, good.Here I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate.I work direct with the right brain.If you pass the left brain,you have to take care of logic and common sense.Direct in the right brain, that's much better. And so --(Laughter) --Arthur Benjamin dida little of the same thing.And if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor,you have -- that's the passwordto thecosmic bank of knowledge,where you can find any solution of any problem.OK. Now, I drop the cards,and you say stop anyway, right?Not at the last card.Zoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.When I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check.(Laughter)Ah, not in order, it -- that was a mistake.No, I'm kidding.(Applause)No, now and then I put in a mistake,just to emphasize how difficult it is.Right?Yeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake.But now I'm glad I remember it.So,this deck is bought here. Sorry.I have a little padto make it a little softer.This deck is bought here in America.It's called"Bicycle." And this deck is very flexible,but not so many people know,if you check, if you press atthe right spots,you see how thin and flexible this deck is, right?Now, you can carry this in your wallet,so ...You don't see it, make no reaction?(Laughter)So, but here,and --is the camera getting too much? No.(Laughter)Yeah? (Audience: It's getting too much.)LG: Pardon? But then, when we will have it back, you do this.But not too much.Then you have to push it down again.Here, please. If you push theseheaps -- everyone see --push them together so they are really interlaced,right? Yeah, good.Perfect.Just push them through, good. Thank you.And then, I will demonstrate a thing fromRussian satellite,stealen -- stolen,probably copied from America but we will see.Here --shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts.Now I go very quickthrough the deck and try to find some pattern.The new chaos theory is already old, right?But you know, I think you arefamiliar with fractals --the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things.And it's mucheasier to memorize cards in a pattern way,and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate,then you go to --then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talkin another language ...Yeah, great.I think I have it.So now, different persons, older, tap.Please name any card, anyone.(Audience: Jack of spades.) LG: Jack of spades.Jack of spades.I think jack of spades is number 12 from the top.One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,nine, 10, 11,12. Yes, right.So -- oh, jack of spades.You said spades? (Audience: Yes.) LG: Ah.My fault. Don't applaud, this was clubs.So, jack of spades.I think ...23 --24, sorry, 24.One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,18, 19, 20, 21, 22,23 --ah, 25, yes.It's the last.Now, I do it quicker, better.OK. Another person. Oh, I forgot, I shouldn't shuffle but I think --(Laughter)-- actually, my technique is to peek,all the time.When I lift the heap, I peek.You see, yeah, perfect.Three, four, five, six. Then I calculate -- yeah, good.(Laughter)Another person, another card. (Audience: Seven of diamonds.)LG: Seven of diamonds. Perfect, my favorite, yeah, seven.So I will do it quick,very quick, but in slow motion, so you can follow.(Laughter)Seven of? (Audience: Diamonds.)LG: Diamonds, good. I start here.Good, thank you.(Applause)The thing I did -- I peeked.I know where the card were,then I chose it. So another person, another card.(Laughter)Another person.(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)LG: Pardon?(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)LG: Ten of diamonds, yeah.I think I do it the same way. I like to,so I know where it is.Ten of diamonds.But now I do it the regular speed, right?Ten of diamonds.Good.Maybe you will cut? Lift.Excellent.So, thank you. Another person, another card.(Audience: Five of clubs.)LG: Pardon? (Audience: Five of clubs.)LG: Five of clubs. It's not the same person, even if it's the same spot.We can take some over there later. So now, I will drop the cards.And you'll say stop, anywhere. Got it?Five of clubs.Not the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here.(Laughter)We do it again.The person who said five of clubs say stop,when the cards are in the air, right?(Audience: Stop.)LG: Very good.OK.(Applause)OK, I had to use a little force there.I think we save five of clubs.And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.(Audience: Queen of hearts.) LG: Queen of hearts, yeah.Excellent. I love that card.Here, I will do the most difficult thing.For example, you are sitting in Las Vegas,and you're betting,and you let the other guyspeek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card.And now, when I lift this card,it shall be your card. What was your card?(Audience: Queen of hearts.)LG: Queen of? Queen of hearts.So that's a tough challenge, right?So here, I grab --you know this? Five of clubs ...and queen of hearts. Yes!This is a tough one,because here I must take advantage of --I switch it with the five of clubs.So, nowa false count.Which card shall I use? Queen or five?Zoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.So, I use the queen, and here's five of clubs.The false count -- and the numberone, two, three,four, five, six, seven, eight --you say the same card all the time.Eight, nine, 10.This is a kind of optical deal, right?When I put one card at a table --look, it's not one card. It's -- look,it's a bunch of cards that gives thisimpression.Yeah.Now some hard stuff.I think we keep the queen here, yes.Now, to the satellites things.This --oh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault.(Laughter)This is high-frequency laser,and it's enough with a fraction of a secondto destroy the retina completely.Right, sorry, my -- I should have mentioned that, yeah.But you can relax,because it takes half an hour before it works,so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance.(Laughter)Now,I put the laser here,and --now, when I deal the cards in the laser,I know where they are but -- yes?Did the camera got it?No?They didn't?What happened?(Audience: It disappeared.)LG: OK, I'll take another group.Do the cameras see the cards now?No? (Audience: No, they're all gone.)LG: But you see the hand.Ah, good, good, good. But now.So now, that was the reason, right?You see the cards? Yes.(Laughter)Yeah, good.Now --(Laughter)-- one guy laughed. So now, to find the queen,do it this way: take back the other one, take back the queen.(Laughter)Yeah, interesting,but a little dangerous.(Laughter)I liked it. Now,a little more difficult.Name -- anyone, name, please, any suit.(Audience: Spades.) LG: Spades? Spades, good.So here,here I have to peek, lots of cards.I think there are lots of --I don't know how many -- but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right?(Laughter)So every time I lift the heap, I peek, right.Then I arrange them so I canget them quick.Perfect, excellent.So I start with the ace --yeah, ace. Ah, yeah -- spades?Same mistake as before, right?So -- I arrange the spades -- the clubs.I try to do this right here. First, I take the spades.You see, I don't work with prestige,so always do mistakes.It doesn't matter to me.And now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right?One,two, three, four -- yes,the camera got it? Five, six,seven, eight --ah --nine, 10,the jack,jack of spades,queen of --I like that laugh, yeah! Good. Queen.(Laughter)Wait, wait, wait -- please take any card.Grab any one. Quick, quick, good.And we switch this to the king.Ace of diamonds.And now, look, ace of diamonds will guide.So I find ...king of spades.There was the place. And here is king of spades, correct?Yeah? OK.(Applause)Now, a little more difficult thing.Maybe you think I have the cards in order already,so you help me to shuffle again.Another suit, please.(Audience: Armani.) LG: Pardon? (Audience: Armani.)(Laughter)LG: It was after the blindfold.I like this guy, yeah.OK. That should be my end effect, but OK.Armani -- who said Armani? You?I drop the cards and you -- which size?Which size? It's a piece of cake. I like challenges.Which size?(Audience: Extra large.) LG: Extra large, OK.Say stop. (Audience: Stop.)(Laughter)LG: Yeah, Armani. OK.(Applause)Ah, this is tough.OK, a suit. I had clubs before, spades.Another suit. (Audience: Diamonds.) LG: Diamonds, perfect.So, in this case,I try tolocate diamonds. I look at the cards, and OK.We try. Yeah. You help me.If I drop the card face up,like this, you reverse it. Zoe: OK.LG: OK, now.Do with both hands, and quick. Yes, good, good.(Laughter)I think we have it now. Yeah, good, good.So here,diamonds, hearts -- no, diamonds. Good, good.Stop. Do you see the pattern?No? Now?Yes, yes, OK.I work with pattern.Oh sorry, I dropped one.Maybe it's important --yeah --nine of diamonds, OK.So now --I always ask,why do I put myself in this position?I have to figure out so many outs,when I miss some cards, butI love it. So now,I will do it. I will try to findthe diamonds,but I will do it the hard way.It's too easy to do it right away, right?I think I will do it ...blindfolded.At this distance, it works immediately.Aargh!(Laughter)Duct tape.I look -- shake the cards, so I don't.Go ahead. Yeah, good. I like the empathy.Empathy.But it was -- did you hear?It was women's voice. Hear the guy -- yeah, more, more, more.(Laughter)Yeah, good. Yeah.You can take the nostril too, because some guys think --(Laughter)-- some guys think I can peek through the nostril, so domore. Go, go.Right? Good.Satisfied?Looks good, like Batman. Ow!(Laughter)No, with dignity and elegance, right?But I like her, yeah. I said, be a little tough.And it was OK. One more?The last.OK.All right.Now you must agree that I'm --I must rely on other senses, right?I work with vibration.So,what was the card?Diamonds. Ah, I memorized hearts.So now I haveto improvise again.Maybe I'll stand up. Half.Diamonds -- I'll start with ace of diamonds.Just kidding, warming up -- king of hearts.(Laughter)And I give you a diamonds, so they -- so you put them here,in a nice row, right. And you can see, yeah? Good.Ace of diamonds, yes? Zoe: Yeah.LG: Good. Good. Two -- (Applause) --thank you.I never ever miss two. This is interesting.Always I've found two,but the wrong color. Spades, sorry.And the deck is a gift to you after,so let the skepticals here, in this,examine them, right? Remind me. It's a gift.Two -- and it was two of spades, right?Sorry, two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now.Three --three of diamonds. Yes!Four --I like challenges, yes.Yeah, good.Chris Anderson: You're peeking.LG: Pardon?CA: You're peeking. You just got to --this is a request from the lady in the back.(Laughter)Okay.Try that.LG: Yeah. Also listen.OK, now.This is maybe a little tough.We will try.Yes? Good?(Laughter)OK. So,how many cards? Five? Zoe: Four.LG: Four. Is five the next card?Zoe: Five of diamonds, yeah.LG: It's not here? Zoe: It's not there.LG: Oh.So here,all the cards are face down --you agree? (Audience: Yes.)LG: Yes? You see that in the screen?And this is face up, and it's not at the bottom here.So next card will be -- was it five?Zoe: Five. LG: Yeah --I will reverse it face up here.Yes? Zoe: Yeah.LG: Six -- six with the thumb.Seven.Yeah, I do this. I know where it is,because I peeked before and then I do this.Right?Eight.If --and then nine, right?Yeah.Yesterday -- the day before yesterday, I was in Vegas,and I used this actually.Nine? Yeah? Correct?No? Yes! Ah, good, good.Ten --once again, I love this Jonny Wayne move.Yeah. Jack -- you [unclear] with Jack?Jackofdiamonds, correct? (Audience: No.)LG: Yes?Andqueen! Queen, with misdirection.Misdirection. (Applause)Yeah?And then,king, after exactlyfive seconds.Yeah. Five. Five seconds.One,two, three, four -- mmm!Check it.Yes?CA: King of diamonds. LG: Ah!Good. Oh.Touch me, feel --ah, ah, you know!CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Lennart Green! LG: Okay, thank you.

Let's just start by looking at some great photographs.This is an icon of National Geographic,an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry.But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come outwith a parody of National Geographic,and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph.Oh, the wrath of Photoshop.This is a jet landing at San Francisco, by Bruce Dale.He mounted a camera on the tail.A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell.Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson.I love this photograph because it reminds meof Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer.A polar bear swimming in the Arctic, by Paul Nicklen.Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth --they're not very good swimmers --and we know what's happening to the ice.These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa,photographed by Chris Johns.Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels.This is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard,a great portraitist.And Jane Goodall, making her own special connection,photographed by Nick Nichols.This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey.And David said that there was lot of weird stuffhappening on the dance floor.But, hey, at least it's hygienic.(Laughter)These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance,by David Doubilet.And this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason.And finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars,photographed by Emory Kristof.Photography carries a power that holds upunder the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world,because photographs emulate the waythat our mind freezes a significant moment.Here's an example.Four years ago, I was at the beach with my son,and he was learning how to swimin this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches.But I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptideand started to be pulled out towards the jetty.I can stand here right now and see,as I go tearing into the water after him,the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement.I can see the rocks are over here.There's a wave about to crash onto him.I can see his hands reaching out,and I can see his face in terror,looking at me, saying, "Help me, Dad."I got him. The wave broke over us.We got back on shore; he was fine.We were a little bit rattled.But this flashbulb memory, as it's called,is when all the elements came together to definenot just the event, but my emotional connection to it.And this is what a photograph taps intowhen it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.Now I have to tell you,I was talking to Kyle last week about this,that I was going to tell this story.And he said, "Oh, yeah, I remember that too!I remember my image of youwas that you were up on the shore yelling at me."(Laughter)I thought I was a hero.(Laughter)So,this represents -- this is a cross-sample ofsome remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists,working at the very top of their craft --except one.This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Masonin New Zealand last year,and it was submitted and published in National Geographic.Last year, we added a section to our website called "Your Shot,"where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.And it has become a wild success,tapping into the enthusiast photography community.The quality of these amateur photographscan, at times, be amazing.And seeing this reinforces, for me,that every one of us has at least one or twogreat photographs in them.But to be a great photojournalist,you have to have more than just one or twogreat photographs in you.You've got to be able to make them all the time.But even more importantly,you need to know how to create a visual narrative.You need to know how to tell a story.So I'm going to share with you some coveragesthat I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.Photographer Nick Nichols went to documenta very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuaryin Chad, called Zakouma.The original intent was to travel thereand bring back a classic story of diverse species,of an exotic locale.And that is what Nick did, up to a point.This is a serval cat.He's actually taking his own picture,shot with what's called a camera trap.There's an infrared beam that's going across,and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.These are baboons at a watering hole.Nick -- the camera, again, an automatic cameratook thousands of pictures of this.And Nick ended up with a lot of picturesof the rear ends of baboons.(Laughter)A lion having a late night snack --notice he's got a broken tooth.And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den.I love this little bit of waterthat comes off the back of his tail.But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants.It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.Here's a photograph shot in moonlight,something that digital photography has made a big difference for.It was with the elephants that this story pivoted.Nick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay,collared the matriarch of the herd.They named her Annie,and they began tracking her movements.The herd was safe within the confines of the park,because of this dedicated group of park rangers.But once the annual rains began,the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.And that's when they ran into trouble.For outside the safety of the park were poachers,who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.The matriarch that they were radio tracking,after weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park,came to a halt outside the park.Annie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.And they only came for the ivory.This is actually one of the rangers.They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory,because they couldn't leave it there,because it's still valuable.But what Nick did was he brought backa story that went beyond the old-school methodof just straight, "Isn't this an amazing world?"And instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply.Instead of just knowledge of this park,he created an understanding and an empathyfor the elephants, the rangers and the many issuessurrounding human-wildlife conflicts.Now let's go over to India.Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurmantouches upon in his new world population project.For the first time in history,more people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.And most of that growth is not in the cities,but in the slums that surround them.Jonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer,came to me and said,"We need to document this, and here's my proposal.Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world."And I said, "Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget."So instead, what we did waswe decided to, instead of going out and doing what would resultin what we'd consider sort of a survey story --where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything --we put Jonas into Dharavi,which is part of Mumbai, India,and let him stay there, and really get intothe heart and soul of this really major part of the city.What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface lookat the awful conditions that exist in such places.He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital partof how the entire urban area functioned.By staying tightly focused in one place,Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spiritthat underlies this community.And he did it in a beautiful way.Sometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerryand photojournalist Randy Olsonto document the depletion of the world's fisheries.We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject,but the photographs that Brian and Randy createdare among the best to capture both the humanand natural devastation of overfishing.Here, in a photo by Brian,a seemingly crucified shark is caught upin a gill net off of Baja.I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch,the animals accidentally scooped upwhile fishing for a specific species.But here, Brian captured a unique viewby positioning himself underneath the boatwhen they threw the waste overboard.And Brian then went on to even greater riskto get this never-before-made photographof a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.Back on land, Randy Olson photographeda makeshift fish market in Africa,where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals,the main parts having already been sent to Europe.And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.As prime food sources are depleted,the harvest goes deeper into the oceansand brings in more such sources of protein.This is called fishing down the food chain.But there are also glimmers of hope,and I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this,we don't really want to goand just look at all the problems.We also want to look for solutions.Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand,where commercial fishing had been banned --the result being that the overfished species have been restored,and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.Photography can also compel us to confrontissues that are potentially distressing and controversial.James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED,took a look at the sweep of the medical systemthat is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one endand exits back home, on the other.Jim started in the battlefield.Here, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldieron the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.Here is in the field hospital.The soldier on the right has the name of his daughtertattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.From here, the more severely wounded are transportedback to Germany, where they meet up with their familiesfor the first time.And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals,such as here in Walter Reed.And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis,they exit the medical system and attemptto regain their pre-war lives.Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science storyand gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.Now, these stories are great examplesof how photography can be usedto address some of our most important topics.But there are also times when photographerssimply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it,just plain fun.Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarcticato shoot a story on leopard seals.They have been rarely photographed, partly because they are consideredone of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.In fact, a year earlier, a researcher had beengrabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitantabout getting into the water.Now, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins.You know of "The March of the Penguins."This is sort of the munch of the penguins.(Laughter)Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks outto see if the coast is clear.And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.But then Paul got in the water.And he said he was never really afraid of this.Well, this one female came up to him.She's probably -- it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph,but she's 12 feet long.So, she is pretty significant in size.And Paul said he was never really afraid,because she was more curious about him than threatened.This mouthing behavior, on the right,was really her way of saying to him, "Hey, look how big I am!"Or you know, "My, what big teeth you have."(Laughter)Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.To her, here was this big, goofy creature in the waterthat for some reason didn't seem to be interestedin chasing penguins.So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him,alive, and put them in front of him.She dropped them off, and then they would swim away.She'd kind of look at him, like "What are you doing?"Go back and get them, and then bring them backand drop them in front of him.And she did this over the course of a couple of days,until the point where she got so frustrated with himthat she started putting them directly on top of his head.(Laughter)Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph.(Laughter)Eventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figuredthat he was never going to survive.This is her just puffing out, you know,snorting out in disgust.(Laughter)And lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.Paul set out to photograph a relativelymysterious and unknown creature,and came back with not just a collection of photographs,but an amazing experience and a great story.It is these kinds of stories,ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficialthat demonstrate the power of photojournalism.I believe that photography can make a real connection to people,and can be employed as a positive agentfor understanding the challenges and opportunitiesfacing our world today.Thank you.(Applause)

So I'm going to talk today about collecting storiesin some unconventional ways.This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.You might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.Anyway, it was a time when I was mainly interestedin collecting imaginary stories.So this is a picture of meholding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.And recently I've been much more interested in collecting storiesfrom reality -- so, real stories.And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,stories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.So I'll be talking about each of those today.So, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.I have many of these books,and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.They accompany me wherever I go in my life,and I fill them with all sorts of things,records of my lived experience:so watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,dead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,business cards, writings.And in these books, you can find these short, little glimpsesof moments and experiences and people that I meet.And, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years,I started to become very interested in collectingnot only my own personal artifacts,but also the artifacts of other people.So, I started collecting found objects.This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York Cityabout 10 years ago.On the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face,and on the back it says, "To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice.Have fun in whatever you do."And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life.As opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,and then letting your own mind fill in the rest.And that idea of a partial glimpse is somethingthat will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.So, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,and I noticed that it was suddenly possibleto collect these sorts of personal artifacts,not just from street corners, but also from the Internet.And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scoresof digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.Blog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions,all of these things were being expressed by people online,and leaving behind trails.So, I started to write computer programsthat study very, very large sets of these online footprints.One such project is about a year and a half old.It's called "We Feel Fine."This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entriesevery two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases"I feel" and "I am feeling." And when it finds one of those phrases,it grabs the full sentence up to the periodand also tries to identify demographic information about the author.So, their gender, their age, their geographic locationand what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence.It collects about 20,000 such sentences a dayand it's been running for about a year and a half,having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.This is, then, how they're presented.These dots here represent some of the English-speaking world'sfeelings from the last few hours,each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,so the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.And the diameter of each dot correspondsto the length of the sentence inside.So the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer."I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excusefor why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,"from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan."I got this on some trading locally,but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap."Also, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.And when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created,which consist of the sentence and images being combined.And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside."I feel good.""I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds,but it was worth it.""I love how they were able to preserve most in everythingthat makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies,man-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python."So the next movement is called mobs.This provides a slightly more statistical look at things.This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,dominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traitsof the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,the cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,and the snowy ones flutter to the ground.You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their spotson a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from "We Feel Fine."These are the images that are automatically constructed."I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe."(Laughter)"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good,the kisses felt messy and wrong,but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual.""I can feel my cancer grow.""I feel pretty.""I feel skinny, but I'm not.""I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict,and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive.""I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month,because I feel the need for speed."(Laughter)"I feel sassy.""I feel so sexy in this new wig."As you can see, "We Feel Fine" collectsvery, very small-scale personal stories.Sometimes, stories as short as two or three words.So, really even challenging the notionof what can be considered a story.And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,not with the Internet,and only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.So these are some newer projects thatactually aren't even launched publicly yet.The first such one is called "The Whale Hunt."Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,the northernmost settlement in the United States,with a family of Inupiat Eskimos,documenting their annual spring whale hunt.This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,camping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.And that water that you see there is the open lead,and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,it throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale upunder the ice, and cuts it up.And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.So I went up there, and I lived with these guysout in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,and ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.So every five minutes, I took a photograph.When I was awake, with the camera around my neck.When I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.And then in moments of high adrenaline,like when something exciting was happening,I would up that photographic frequency to as many as37 photographs in five minutes.So what this created was a photographic heartbeatthat sped up and slowed down, more or less matchingthe changing pace of my own heartbeat.That was the first concept here.The second concept was to use this experience to think aboutthe fundamental components of any story.What are the things that make up a story?So, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.They have colors. What do they look like?They have time. When did it take place? Dates -- when did it occur?And in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level.The thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediumsthat we're accustomed to -- things like novels, radio,photographs, movies, even lectures like this one --we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,some kind of omniscient, external bodythrough whose eyes you see the story.We're very used to this.But if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.I mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,and there's all of these overlapping storiesintersecting and touching each other.And so I thought it would be interesting to build a frameworkto surface those types of stories. So, in the case of "The Whale Hunt,"how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,dominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,with an excitement level of high?So, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?I built a web interface for viewing "The Whale Hunt" that attempts to do just this.So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,and the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.You can start to see some of the story here, told by color.So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaperin the basement apartment where I was staying.And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.You can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.These are organized chronologically.Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.And any of these can be clicked,and then the narrative is entered at that position.So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.That's "Moby Dick."This is the food we ate.This is in the Patkotak's family living roomin their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us.Cigarette break outside -- I don't smoke.This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.This is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean.This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to bereminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph,showing the exciting moments of adrenaline.This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in "The Whale Hunt"and the two whales that were killed down here.And we could do something as arbitrary as, say,extract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of bloodand whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.And now we've whittled down that whole storyto just 29 matching photographs,and then we can enter the narrative at that position.And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.These whales are about 40 feet long,and weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food sourcefor the community for much of the year.Skipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.They use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,and an incredibly efficient process.This is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.This is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.It's baleen. Moving on.So what I'm going to tell you about nextis a very new thing. It's not even a project yet.So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that,I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdomnestled between Tibet and India.And I was doing a project there about happiness,interviewing a lot of local people.So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they basemost of their high-level governmental decisions around the conceptof gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,and they've been doing this since the '70s.And it leads to just a completely different value system.It's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,where people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.So, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,and took a number of set photographs,and interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.I would start by asking people to rate their happinessbetween one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.And then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloonsand give them that number of balloons to hold.So, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,and some really sad soul holding one balloon.But you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.(Laughter)And then I would ask them a number of questions likewhat was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.And then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.And when they made a wish, I would write their wishonto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippetsof some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.This is an 11-year-old student.He was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,and they all had plastic toy guns.His wish was to become a police officer.He was getting started early. Those were his hands.I took pictures of everybody's hands,because I think you can often tell a lot about somebodyfrom how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody,and asked everybody to make a funny face.A 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy.She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan,and it's a lot easier if you're a boy.A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner.If you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understandhow amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there.He wanted to help poor people.A 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat,and that pile of wheat behind herhad taken her about a week to make.She wanted to keep farming until she dies.You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here.She was wearing this silver ring that had the word "love" engraved on it,and she'd found it in the road somewhere.A 16-year-old quarry worker.This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight,but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer.A 21-year-old monk. He was very happy.He wanted to live a long life at the monastery.He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face,which I'm told is very good luck.He was kind of too shy to make a funny face.A 16-year-old student.She wanted to become an independent woman.I asked her about that, and she said she meantthat she doesn't want to be married,because, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman,your chances to live an independent life kind of end,and so she had no interest in that.A 24-year-old truck driver.There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucksthat come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic,with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road,and he was driving one of these trucks.But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people.A 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break.She'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road.Her wish was to marry someone with a car.She wanted a change in her life.She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road,and she wanted a different lot on things.An 81-year-old itinerant farmer.I saw this guy on the side of the road,and he actually doesn't have a home.He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work,and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at.So his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live.He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his ghoand started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face.It was all good-natured.A 10-year-old.He wanted to join a school and learn to read,but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school.He was eating this orange, sugary candythat he kept dipping his fingers into,and since there was so much saliva on his hands,this orange paste started to form on his palms.(Laughter)A 37-year-old road worker.One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutanis the use of Indian cheap laborthat they import from India to build the roads,and then they send these people home once the roads are built.So these guys were in a worker's gangmixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway.His wish was to make some money and open a store.A 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road.I asked her about her wish, and she said,"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish."She was chewing betel nut, which caused her teethover the years to turn very red.Finally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to.Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet.I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said,"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent,but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage."And I said, "You mean, like a cave?" And she said, "Yeah, like a cave."And I said, "Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?"And she said, "Well, you know,I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave."I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way --with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter --that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped intoon the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years.I asked her a little bit more about the caveand what she planned would happen once she went there, you know.What if she saw the truth after just one year,what would she do for the next 35 years in her life?And this is what she said.Woman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe -- maybe I'll die.Jonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes.JH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time.Woman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can diewithin one year, or something like that.JH: Are you hoping to?Woman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.JH: Yeah, but -- yeah, OK. Do you hope --would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years,or to live for one year?Woman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.JH: 40 to 50? Yeah.Woman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven.JH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it.Woman: Thank you.JH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be.So thank you again, so much.Woman: You're most welcome.JH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to diewhen she was around 40. That was enough life for her.So, the last thing we did, very quickly,is I took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews,117 wishes -- and I brought them up to a place called Dochula,which is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet,one of the more sacred places in Bhutan.And up there, there are thousands of prayer flagsthat people have spread out over the years.And we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string,and hung them up there among the prayer flags.And they're actually still flying up there today.So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future,you can go check these out. Here are some images from that.We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true.You can start to see some familiar balloons here."To make some money and to open a store" was the Indian road worker.Thanks very much.(Applause)

My search is always to find ways to chronicle,to share and to document stories about people, just everyday people.Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence,but that are never sentimental,that never look away from the darkest things about us.Because I really believe that we're never more beautifulthan when we're most ugly.Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of.As Chris said, I grew up in Nigeriawith a whole generation -- in the '80s --of students who were protesting a military dictatorship, which has finally ended.So it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us.But what I've come to learnis that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures,but in the simple accumulation of gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion,everyday acts of compassion.In South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu.Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says,the only way for me to be human is for you to reflectmy humanity back at me.But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to ituntil there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window.Then suddenly I see it, and usually, it's never good.It's usually when I'm cussing in trafficat someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffeeand send emails and make notes.So what Ubuntu really saysis that there is no way for us to be human without other people.It's really very simple, but really very complicated.So, I thought I should start with some stories.I should tell you some stories about remarkable people,so I thought I'd start with my mother.(Laughter)And she was dark, too.My mother was English.My parents met in Oxford in the '50s,and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there.She was five foot two, very feisty and very English.This is how English my mother is -- or was, she just passed.She came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me,and we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing.(Laughter)And then we went to a fish restaurant,and we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us,and he came up and my mother said,"Do you have any specials, young man?"And Chad says, "Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon,that's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust.It's totally rad."And my mother turned to me and said,"What language is he speaking?"(Laughter)I said, "English, mum."And she shook her head and said,"Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language,why don't they use it?"(Laughter)So, this woman, who converted from the Church of Englandto Catholicism when she married my father --and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert --decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria,particularly among Igbo women,the Billings ovulation method,which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.But her Igbo wasn't too good.So she took me along to translate.I was seven.(Laughter)So, here are these women,who never discuss their period with their husbands,and here I am telling them, "Well, how often do you get your period?"(Laughter)And, "Do you notice any discharges?"(Laughter)And, "How swollen is your vulva?"(Laughter)She never would have thought of herself as a feminist,my mother, but she always used to say,"Anything a man can do, I can fix."(Applause)And when my father complained about this situation,where she's taking a seven-year-old boyto teach this birth control, you know,he used to say, "Oh, you're turning him into --you're teaching him how to be a woman."My mother said, "Someone has to."(Laughter)This woman -- during the Biafran war,we were caught in the war.It was my mother with five little children.It takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp,to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country.At every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldierswho want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine,and make him a boy soldier.Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman,standing up to men with guns who want to kill us?All through that one year,my mother never cried one time, not once.But when we were in Lisbon, in the airport,about to fly to England,this woman saw my mother wearing this dress,which had been washed so many times it was basically see through,with five really hungry-looking kids,came over and asked her what had happened.And she told this woman.And so this woman emptied out her suitcaseand gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us,and the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but --(Laughter) --that was the only time she cried.And I remember years later, I was writing about my mother,and I asked her, "Why did you cry then?"And she said, "You know, you can steel your heartagainst any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.But the simple act of kindness from a complete strangerwill unstitch you."The old women in my father's village, after this war had happened,memorized the names of every dead person,and they would sing these dirges, made up of these names.Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.And they would sing them only when they planted the rice,as though they were seeding the hearts of the deadinto the rice.But when it came for harvest time,they would sing these joyful songs,that were made up of the names of every childwho had been born that year.And then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge,they would remove as many names of the deadthat equaled as many people that were born.And in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation,beautiful transformation.Did you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda,the word for rape and the word for marriagewas the same one?But today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.Did you also know that after apartheid,when the new government went into the parliament houses,there were no female toilets in the building?Which would seem to suggest that apartheidwas entirely the business of men.All of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death,women are never really counted.Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us.When I was growing up in Nigeria --and I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general,but in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from --there were always rites of passage for young men.Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women,that's essentially what it is.And a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals,progressing along, so when I turned 13 --and, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community,somebody had to kill the animals,there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at --so when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat.And I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it,but I had to do it.And I was supposed to do this alone.But a friend of mine, called Emmanuel,who was significantly older than me,who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war,decided to come with me.Which sort of made me feel good,because he'd seen a lot of things.Now, when I was growing up, he used to tell mestories about how he used to bayonet people,and their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.So, this guy comes with me.And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one --they sound like human beings,that's why we call tragedies "a song of a goat."My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become humanuntil we started keeping goats.Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't,Emmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat,covers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them,while I kill the goat.It didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much,and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemedsuch a quotidian experience,still found it in himself to try to protect me.I was a wimp.I cried for a very long time.And afterwards, he didn't say a word.He just sat there watching me cry for an hour.And then afterwards he said to me,"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time,you will die of heartbreak.Just know that it is enough sometimesto know that it is difficult."Of course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep,and not in good ways.(Laughter)So, I was born two days after Christmas.So growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything,but I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas.So, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany,and we had the Catholic priest over,my mother was entertaining him with tea.And my uncle suddenly says, "Where are Chris' presents?"And my mother said, "Don't talk about that in front of guests."But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back,so he summoned me up, and he said,"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom.Take anything you want out of the suitcase.It's your birthday present."I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt,but I found an inflatable sheep.(Laughter)So, I blew it up and ran into the living room,my finger where it shouldn't have been,I was waving this buzzing sheep around,and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.(Laughter)And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered,just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said,"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish."(Laughter)(Applause)My last days in prison, the last 18 months,my cellmate -- for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months --my cellmate was 14 years old.The name was John James,and in those days, if a family member committed a crime,the military would hold you as ransomtill your family turned themselves in.So, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.There were some really bad people there.And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books --"Spiderman" and "X-Men."He was obsessed.And when he got tired of reading them,he started to teach the men in death row how to read,with these comic books.And so, I remember night after night,you'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals,huddled around John James, reciting, "Take that, Spidey!"(Laughter)It's incredible.I was really worried.He didn't know what death row meant.I'd been there twice,and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die.And he would always laugh, and say,"Come on, man, we'll make it out."Then I'd say, "How do you know?"And he said, "Oh, I heard it on the grapevine."They killed him.They handcuffed him to a chair,and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail,then left him there to bleed to death.That's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known.All around us, everywhere, there are people like this.The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods.They would come together as a community,and they would express a wish.And their wish would then be brought to a priest,who would find a ritual object,and the appropriate sacrifices would be made,and the shrine would be built for the god.But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice,the Igbos would destroy the god.They would knock down the shrine,and they would stop saying the god's name.This is how they came to reclaim their humanity.Every day, all of us here,we're building gods that have gone rampant,and it's time we started knocking them downand forgetting their names.It doesn't require a tremendous thing.All it requires is to recognize among us, every day --the few of us that can see -- are surrounded by peoplelike the ones I've told you.There are some of you in this room, amazing people,who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity.I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton.The poem is called "Libation," and it's for my friend Vusiwho is in the audience here somewhere."Libation,North Carolina, 1999.I offer to this ground, this gin.I imagine an old man crying here,out of the sight of the overseer.He pushes his tongue through a holewhere his tooth would be, if he were whole.It aches in that space where his tooth would be,where his land would be,his house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter.He wipes sorrow from his face,and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue,and tastes the salt.I call a name that could be his.This is for you, old man.This gin, this salty earth."Thank you.(Applause)

I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.And I like to immerse myself in my topics.I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.And I see my life as a series of experiments.So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,I wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life,"where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,to live my life for me.So, they answered my emails.They answered my phone.They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.It was the best month of my life,because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.It was a wonderful experience.More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called --about radical honesty.And this is a movement where --this is started by a psychologist in Virginia,who says that you should never, ever lie,except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.And, more than that, whatever is on your brainshould come out of your mouth.So, I decided I would try this for a month.This was the worst month of my life.(Laughter)I do not recommend this at all.To give you a sense of the experience,the article was called, "I Think You're Fat."(Laughter)So, that was hard.My most recent book -- my previous book was called "The Know-It-All,"and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannicafrom A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,all the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending.(Laughter)It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.But I love that one,because that was an experiment about how much informationone human brain could absorb.Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.You can just Google it.So, I wasted some time there.I love those experiments,but I think that the most profoundand life-changing experiment that I've doneis my most recent experiment, where I spent a yeartrying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,"The Year of Living Biblically."And I undertook this for two reasons.The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same waythe Olive Garden is Italian.(Laughter)So, not very.But I've become increasingly interested in religion.I do think it's the defining issue of our time,or one of the main ones.And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.The second reason I undertook this is becauseI'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,religious fundamentalism, and people who saythey take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,as high as 45 or 50 percent of America.So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?I decided to take it to its logical conclusionand take everything in the Bible literally,without picking and choosing.The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.I had Christian bibles.I had Jewish bibles.A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, "The Lord is all that,"as opposed to what I knew it as, "The Lord is my shepherd."Then I went down and I read several versions,and I wrote down every single law that I could find.And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of --The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.So I wanted to follow those.And actually, I take my projects very seriously,because I had twins during my year,so I definitely take my projects seriously.But I also wanted to follow the hundredsof arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.There is the law in Leviticus,"You cannot shave the corners of your beard."I didn't know where my corners were,so I decided to let the whole thing grow,and this is what I looked like by the end.As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.(Laughter)My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.So, certainly the challenge was there.The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers,so I thought, "Sounds strange, but I'll try it."You only know if you try it.I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.The Bible says that if two men are in a fight,and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,then her hand shall be cut off.So, I wanted to follow that rule.(Laughter)That one I followed by default,by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,looking like she had a strong grip.(Laughter)So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard.I will say it was an amazing yearbecause it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.You know, I could spend a year not killing,but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying --you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress,because I couldn't believe how muchmy behavior changed my thoughts.This was one of the huge lessons of the year,is that I almost pretended to be a better person,and I became a little bit of a better person.So I had always thought, you know, "You change your mind,and you change your behavior," but it's often the other way around.You change your behavior, and you change your mind.So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,you visit sick people in the hospital,and you will become more compassionate.You donate money to a cause,and you become emotionally involved in that cause.So, it really was cognitive psychology --you know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing.The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,very primitive cognitive psychology.In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,which, as we know, is actually true.The second type of rule that was difficult to obeywas the rules that will get you into a little troublein twenty-first-century America.And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.(Laughter)But it's a big part of the Bible,so I figured I had to address it.So, I was able to stone one adulterer.It happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,so sandals and sort of a white robe,you know, because again, the outer affects the inner.I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.And this man came up to me and he said,"Why are you dressed like that?"And I explained my project,and he said, "Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?"And I said, "Well, that would be great!"(Laughter)And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocketthat I had been carrying around for weeks,hoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles --but he grabbed them out of my hand.He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.He grabbed them out of my handand threw them at my face, and I felt that I could --eye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow meto talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,and yet so incredibly wise in others?How should we view the Bible?Should we view it, you know, as original intent,like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?How was the Bible written?And actually, since this is a tech crowd,I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds meof the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editorsover hundreds of years.And it's sort of evolved.It's not a book that was written and came down from on high.So I thought I would end by telling youjust a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessonsthat I learned from my year.The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.This became very, very clear, early on.Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,and stoning adulterers, or -- here's another example.Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.(Laughter)It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch womenduring certain times of the month, and more than that,you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.And my wife thought this was very offensive,so she sat in every seat in our apartment,and I had to spend much of the year standinguntil I bought my own seat and carried it around.So, you know, I met with creationists.I went to the creationists' museum.And these are the ultimate literalists.And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.It's just that their faith is so strongin this literal interpretation of the Biblethat they distort all the data to fit their model.And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.They really did a fantastic job.If you're ever in Kentucky,there's, you can see a movie of the flood,and they have sprinklers in the ceilingthat will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.So, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy --they did a great job.(Laughter)Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.And this one was a big lesson because I was praying,giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.But I was saying thanks all the time, every day,and I started to change my perspective.And I started to realize the hundreds of little thingsthat go right every day, that I didn't even notice,that I took for granted, as opposed to focusingon the three or four that went wrong.So, this is actually a key to happiness for me,is to just remember when I came over here,the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.It's a remarkable thing.Third, that thou shall have reverence.This one was unexpected because I started the yearas an agnostic, and by the end of the year,I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.And I'm trying to start it as a movement.So, if anyone wants to join,the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,and that our rituals can be sacred.The Sabbath can be sacred.This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,because I am a workaholic, so having this one daywhere you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.Thou shall not stereotype.This one happened becauseI spent a lot of time with various religious communitiesthroughout America because I wanted it to be morethan about my journey.I wanted it to be about religion in America.So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.I'm very proud becauseI think I'm the only person in Americato out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness.(Laughter)After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,he's like, "I gotta go."(Laughter)Oh, thank you very much.Thank you. Bless you, bless you.But it was interestingbecause I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,evangelical Christianity, and I found thatit's such a wide and varied movementthat it is difficult to make generalizations about it.There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,and they focus on the red words in the Bible,which are the ones that Jesus spoke.That's how they printed them in the old Bibles.And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.They have a pamphlet that says,"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,"and you open it up, and there's nothing in it.So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,helping poor people.So, this was very inspiring to me.I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagreewith much of what they say.Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.This one was very unexpected because, you know,I grew up with the scientific worldview,and I was shocked learning how much of my lifeis governed by irrational forces.And the thing is, if they're not harmful,they're not to be completely dismissed.Because I learned that -- I was thinking, I wasdoing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?"And they said, "We don't know,but it's just rituals that give us meaning."And I would say, "But that's crazy."And they would say, "Well, what about you?You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guyblowing out the fire on top of a cakeversus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense,but that guy's crazy?'"So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.So the key is to choose the right rituals,the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselvesare not to be dismissed.And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.And this one I learned becauseI tried to follow everything in the Bible.And I failed miserably.Because you can't.You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bibleis going to be picking and choosing.The key is to pick and choose the right parts.There's the phrase called cafeteria religion,and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,and they'll say, "Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.You're just picking and choosing."But my argument is, "What's wrong with cafeterias?"I've had some great meals at cafeterias.I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,about tolerance, about loving your neighbor,as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,or intolerance, or violence,which are very much in the Bible as well.So if we are to find any meaning in this book,then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.And I thought I'd end with just a couple more.There's me reading the Bible.That's how I hailed taxicabs.(Laughter)Seriously, and it worked. And yes,that was actually a rented sheep,so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.

torsten_reil_studies_biology_to_make_animation

I'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now,that we think is going to change the way thatcomputer games and Hollywood movies are being made.That technology is simulating humans.It's simulated humans with a simulated bodyand a simulated nervous system to control that body.Now, before I talk more about that technology,let's have a quick look at what human characters look likeat the moment in computer games.This is a clip from a game called "Grand Theft Auto 3."We already saw that briefly yesterday.And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game.It's one of the most successful games of all time.But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive.They pretty much look the same.I've made him run into a wall here, over and over again.And you can see he looks always the same.The reason for that is that these charactersare actually not real characters.They are a graphical visualization of a character.To produce these animations, an animator at a studio has to anticipatewhat's going to happen in the actual game,and then has to animate that particular sequence.So, he or she sits down, animates it, and tries to anticipate what's going to happen,and then these particular animations are just played backat appropriate times in the computer game.Now, the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity.All you have is animations that are played backat more or less the appropriate times.It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be,because you only get out of it, at least in terms of the character,what you actually put into it.There's no real emergence there.And thirdly, as I said, most of the animations are very repetitive because of that.Now, the only way to get around thatis to actually simulate the human bodyand to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body.And maybe, if I could have you for a quick demonstrationto show what the difference is --because, I mean, it's very, very trivial.If I push Chris a bit, like this, for example, he'll react to it.If I push him from a different angle, he'll react to it differently,and that's because he has a physical body,and because he has the motor skills to control that body.It's a very trivial thing.It's not something you get in computer games at the moment, at all.Thank you very much. Chris Anderson: That's it?Torsten Reil: That's it, yes.So, that's what we're trying to simulate --not Chris specifically, I should say, but humans in general.Now, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University,and we tried to start very simply.What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk.That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen.So, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc.If you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this.The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in itthat actually makes it work.And for that, we use the neural network, which we based onthat part of the nervous system that we have in our spinethat controls walking in humans.It's called the central pattern generator.So, we simulated that as well, and then the really tricky bitis to teach that network how to walk.For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms.We heard about those already yesterday,and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already.But, just briefly, the concept is thatyou create a large number of different individuals --neural networks, in this case --all of which are random at the beginning.You hook these up -- in this case, to the virtual musclesof that two-legged creature here --and hope that it does something interesting.At the beginning, they're all going to be very boring.Most of them won't move at all,but some of them might make a tiny step.Those are then selected by the algorithm,reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well.And you repeat that process over and over again,until you have something that walks --in this case, in a straight line, like this.So that was the idea behind this.When we started this, I set up the simulation one evening.It took about three to four hours to run the simulation.I got up the next morning, went to the computer and looked at the results,and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line,like I've just demonstrated,and this is what I got instead.(Laughter)So, it was back to the drawing board for us.We did get it to work eventually,after tweaking a bit here and there.And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run.So, what you'll see in a moment is a very simple bipedthat's learning how to walk using artificial evolution.At the beginning, it can't walk at all,but it will get better and better over time.So, this is the one that can't walk at all.(Laughter)Now, after five generations of applying evolutionary process,the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better.(Laughter)Generation 10 and it'll take a few steps more --still not quite there.But now, after generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over.That was the real breakthrough for us.It was, academically, quite a challenging project,and once we had reached that stage, we were quite confidentthat we could try and do other things as well with this approach --actually simulating the bodyand simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it.Now, at this stage, it also became clear that this could be very excitingfor things like computer games or online worlds.What you see here is the character standing there,and there's an obstacle that we put in its way.And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle.Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right,which is what I'm doing now, here,it will fall over it in a completely different way.And again, if you move the obstacle a tiny bit, it'll again fall differently.(Laughter)Now, what you see, by the way, at the top there,are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles.Okay. That's the video. Thanks.Now, this might look kind of trivial, but it's actually very importantbecause this is not something you get at the momentin any interactive or any virtual worlds.Now, at this stage, we decided to start a company and move this further,because obviously this was just a very simple, blocky biped.What we really wanted was a full human body.So we started the company.We hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologiststo work on this, and the first thing we had to work onwas to create the human body, basically.It's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine,but it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically.So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing,and tried to make it as realistic as possible.What you see here on the screen right nowis a very simple visualization of that body.I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair, clothes, etc.,but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization,so you can concentrate on the movement.Now, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment,is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens.Nothing really interesting, basically.It falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll, basically.The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it.It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it.So, this character now has motor skills in the upper body --nothing in the legs yet, in this particular one.But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again.It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed.It's going to stick out its hands.It's going to turn around into the fall, and try and catch the fall.So that's what you see here.Now, it gets really interestingif you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well.So here, we've got the same character.I'm going to push it a bit harder now,harder than I just pushed Chris.But what you'll see is -- it's going to receive a push now from the left.What you see is it takes steps backwards,it tries to counter-balance,it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land.I'll show you this again.And then, finally hits the floor.Now, this becomes really excitingwhen you push that character in different directions, again, just as I've done.That's something that you cannot do right now.At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games.What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now.So, here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you,but now I'm just going to push it from different directions.First, starting with a push from the right.This is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on.Now, the angle will have changed a tiny bit,so you can see that the reaction is different.Again, a push, now this time from the front.And you see it falls differently.And now from the left --and it falls differently.That was really exciting for us to see that.That was the first time we've seen that.This is the first time the public sees this as well,because we have been in stealth mode.I haven't shown this to anybody yet.Now, just a fun thing:what happens if you put that character --this is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it --but if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice.We just did that for a laugh, just to see what happens.(Laughter)And this is what happens.(Laughter)(Applause)It's nothing we had to do about this.We just took this character that I just talked about,put it on a slippery surface, and this is what you get out of it.And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach.Now, when we went to film studios and games developersand showed them that technology, we got a very good response.And what they said was, the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen.Because stunts are obviously very dangerous, they're very expensive,and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do, obviously,because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt.So, they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntmanand that's what we've been working on for the past few months.And that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks.So, here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked.That's what people want. That's what we're giving them.(Laughter)You can see, it's always reacting.This is not a dead body. This is a body who basically, in this particular case,feels the force and tries to protect its head.Only, I think it's quite a big blow again.You feel kind of sorry for that thing,and we've seen it so many times now thatwe don't really care any more.(Laughter)There are much worse videos than this, by the way, which I have taken out, but ...Now, here's another one.What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion,a strong force applied to the character,and have the character react to it in midair.So that you don't have a character that looks limp,but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away,that looks kind of alive in midair as well.So this character is going to be hit by a force,it's going to realize it's in the air,and it's going to try and, well,stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing.That's one angle; here's another angle.We now think that the realism we're achieving with thisis good enough to be used in films.And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization.This is something I just got last nightfrom an animation studio in London, who are using our softwareand experimenting with it right now.So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw,but in a slightly better rendered version.So if you look at the character carefully,you see there are lots of body movements going on,none of which you have to animate like in the old days.Animators had to actually animate them.This is all happening automatically in the simulation.This is a slightly different angle,and again a slow motion version of this.This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time.You can run this simulation in real time, in front of your eyes,change it, if you want to, and you get the animation straight out of it.At the moment, doing something like this by handwould take you probably a couple of days.This is another behavior they requested.I'm not quite sure why, but we've done it anyway.It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach.In this case, the character's handsare fixed to a particular point in space,and all we've told the character to do is to struggle.And it looks organic. It looks realistic.You feel kind of sorry for the guy.It's even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night --if you render that a bit more realistically.Now, I'm showing this to you just to show youhow organic it actually can feel, how realistic it can look.And this is all a physical simulation of the body,using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body.Now, one thing which we did for a laugh wasto create a slightly more complex stunt scene,and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bondjumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee.Got a very short clip here.Yes, you can just about see it here.In this case, they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt.It was just voted, I think in the Sunday Times, as one of the most impressive stunts.Now, we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves,"Can we do that ourselves as well?"Can we use the physical simulation of the character,use artificial intelligence,put that artificial intelligence into the character,drive virtual muscles, simulate the way he jumps off the dam,and then skydive afterwards,and have him caught by a bungee afterwards?We did that. It took about altogether just two hours,pretty much, to create the simulation.And that's what it looks like, here.Now, this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages,and we pretty much just did this for a laugh,just to see what we'd get out of it.But what we found over the past few monthsis that this approach -- that we're pretty much standard upon --is incredibly powerful.We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations.There's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before.There's so many things we can do with this right now.The first thing, as I said, is going to be virtual stuntmen.Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen,and they're going to hit the screen quite soon, actually,for some major productions.The second thing is video games.With this technology, video games will look different and they will feel very different.For the first time, you'll have actors that really feel very interactive,that have real bodies that really react.I think that's going to be incredibly exciting.Probably starting with sports games,which are going to become much more interactive.But I particularly am really excitedabout using this technology in online worlds,like there, for example, that Tom Melcher has shown us.The degree of interactivity you're going to getis totally different, I think, from what you're getting right now.A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation.We've been approached by several simulation companies,but one project we're particularly excited about, which we're starting next month,is to use our technology -- and in particular, the walking technology --to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy,to predict the outcome of operations on these children.As you probably know,it's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation isif you try and correct the gait.The classic quote is, I think, it's unpredictable at best,is what people think right now, is the outcome.Now, what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool.We're going to simulate the gait of a particular childand the surgeon can then work on that simulationand try out different ways to improve that gait,before he actually commits to an actual surgery.That's one project we're particularly excited about,and that's going to start next month.Just finally, this is only just the beginning.We can only do several behaviors right now.The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body.The body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have.And, I think, we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing.Right now, we don't have thatbut I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage.We do have one unintentional dancer actually,the last thing I'm going to show you.This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved --half-evolved, I should say -- to produce balance, basically.So, you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter-balance.That's what we thought was going to come out of this.But this is what emerged out of it, in the end.(Music)Bizarrely, this thing doesn't have a head. I'm not quite sure why.So, this was not something we actually put in there.He just started to create that dance himself.He's actually a better dancer than I am, I have to say.And what you see after a while --I think he even goes into a climax right at the end.And I think -- there you go.(Laughter)So, that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there.That's just the simulation creating this itself, basically.So it's just --(Applause)Thanks.Not quite John Travolta yet, but we're working on that as well,so thanks very much for your time.Thanks.(Applause)CA: Incredible. That was really incredible.TR: Thanks.

The telephone.If your mother callsSo nobody is tone-deaf.But I tell you what.But even between those three categories,it's too wide a gulf.So that's what we're going to do.to realize whatever he's dreaming.(Laughter)This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.Some of you will know it.(Music)(Music)for our summer holidays next year."(Laughter)It's funny, isn't it?And of course --(Applause)you might actually drift off.(Laughter)Did anybody think while I was playing,"Why is he using so many impulses?"(Music)(Music ends)So let's see what's really going on here.We have a B. This is a B.The next note is a C.And the job of the C is to make the B sad.And it does, doesn't it?(Laughter)Composers know that.(Music)(Laughter)Now, it goes down to A.Now to G.And then to F.So we have B, A, G, F.And if we have B, A, G, F,what do we expect next?(Music)That might have been a fluke.Let's try it again.(Music)Oh, the TED choir.(Laughter)And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?Nobody is.You know, every village in Bangladeshda, da, da, da -- da.Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.Chopin didn't want to reach the E there,because what will have happened?Act One, scene three,he finds out his uncle killed his father.The critics sitting in the back row there,(Laughter)and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.That's in order to delay --until Act Five, he can kill him.It's the same with the Chopin.He's just about to reach the E,So he does it again.Now, he gets excited.(Music)That's excitement, don't worry about it.but it's the wrong chord --and instead he does ...Now, we call that a deceptive cadence,because it deceives us.(Laughter)(Applause)Right.He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.Now, he tries E again.That chord doesn't work.And then finally ...(Laughter)"Aah, I'm home."Because we all know where home is.B, C, B, C, B, C, B --down to A, down to G, down to F.Goes to F-sharp.

So, I'm in Chile,in the Atacama desert, sitting in a hotel lobby,because that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection,and I have this picture up on my screen,and a woman comes up behind me.She says, "Oh, that's beautiful.What is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?"And unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.I said, "No, it's -- it's penguin shit."(Laughter)And, you know, "Excuse me!"And I could sensethat she thought I was speaking synecdochically.(Laughter)So, I said, "No, no, really -- it's penguin shit."(Laughter)Because I had just been in the Falkland Islandstaking pictures of penguins.This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical.So, literally, a few minutes before that,I downloaded this scientific paperabout calculations on avian defecation,which is really quite interesting, because it turns outyou can model this as something called "Poiseuille flow,"and you can learn an awful lotabout the physics of the avian rectum.Actually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca.At this point, she stops me,and she says, "Who are you?Wha -- what do you do?"And I was stuck,because I didn't have any way to describe what I do.And so, in some sense,this talk todayis my answer to that.It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do.And it's very hard for me to make sense of it,so I'm not sure that you can.It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes --often at four in the morning.So, some people are afraid of what I do.Some people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano,and in response, I have ordereda bulletproof pocket protector.I'm not sure what these people think,because I don't speak Norsk.(Laughter)But I'm not thinking "monsteret" is a good thing.I don't know, you know?So, one of the things that I love to dois travel around the world and look at archaeological sites.Because archaeology gives us an opportunityto study past civilizations,and see where they succeededand where they failed.Use science to, you know,work backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?"And recently, I was in Easter Island,which is an incredibly beautiful place,and an incredibly mysterious place,because no matter where you go in Easter Island,you're struck by these statues, called the moai.The place is 64 square miles.They made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.Why on Earth? And if you haven't readJared Diamond's book, "Collapse,"I totally recommend that you do.He's got a great chapter about it.Basically, these peoplecommitted ecological suicidein order to make more of these.And somewhere along the line, somebody said,"I know! Let's cut down the last treeand commit suicide, becausewe need more identical statues."(Laughter)And,one thing that isn't a mystery, actually,was when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures --and I thought, "Well, why that look on the face?Why that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing.Where did they get that inspiration?And then I met Yoyo,who is the native Rapa Nui-an guide,and if you look at Yoyo's face,you kind of figure out where they got it.There's many mysteries, these statues.Everyone wants to know, how did they make them,how did they transport them?This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg.She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.And she has studied the statues for 20-some years,and she has detailed records of every single statue.The one on the page here is the same that's up there.One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard.So, this used to be completely smooth.In fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them,the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth.But after 1,000 years out in the weather,they look like this.Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all,and we're going to do a very high-res digitization,first because it's a way of preserving them.Second, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,learn a few of the mysteries about them.How long have they been standing in what positions?And maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues ofwhat caused them to be the way they are.While I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also,so you get a gratuitous pictureof a moai with a comet.I also have an archaeological project going onin Egypt."Going on" is perhaps a little bit strong.We're trying to get all of the permissionsto get everything all set, to get it going.So, I'll talk about it at a future TED.But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.Another thing I do is I invent stuff.In fact, I design nuclear reactors.Not a joke.This is the conventionalnuclear fuel cycle.The red line is what is done inmost nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle.The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle,where you reprocess.Now, this is the normal way it's done.It's got the huge advantage that itdoes not create carbon pollution.It has a lot of disadvantages:each one of these steps is extremely expensive,it's potentially dangerousand they have the interesting property that the stepcannot be performed in anyone's backyard,which is a problem.So, our reactor eliminates these steps,which, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing.Now, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.There's -- no reactor's been even builtto an old design, much less a new one, in the United Statesfor 25 years.It's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-returnthing that we do.Changing into a totally different field,we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics,particularly in an area called metamaterials.A metamaterial is an artificial material,which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation,in a way that you couldn't otherwise.So, this device here is an invisibility cloak.It may not seem that, but if you were a microwave,this is how you would view it.Rays of light -- in this case, microwave light --come in, and they just squish around the cell,and they come back the other side.Now, you could do that with mirrors from one angle.The cool thing is, this does it from all angles.Metamaterials, unfortunately --A, it only works on microwave,and B, it doesn't work all that well yet.But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.It's -- you know, today I'd like to sayit's a zero billion dollar business, but,in fact, it's negative.But some day, some day, maybe it's going to work.We do a lot of work in biomedical fields.In this case, we're working with a major medical foundationto develop inexpensive ways of diagnosingdiseases in developing countries.So, they say the eyes are the windows of the soul --turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff.And these happen to be my eyes, by the way.Now, I'm also very interested in cooking.While I was at Microsoft, I took a leave of absenceand went to a chef school in France.I used to work, also while at Microsoft,at a leading restaurant in Seattle,so I do a lot of cooking.I've been on a team that wonthe world championship of barbecue.But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foodslike chili, or bouillabaisse.Various parts of the world will have a cult foodthat people get enormously attached to --there's tremendous traditions, there's secrecy.And I'm trying to use a veryscientific approach.So, this is my latest cooker,and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor,that's because it is.But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials --and of course, really the controller over there does it all on software --you can make some terrific ribs.(Laughter)This is a high-speed centrifuge.You should all have one in your kitchen,beside your Turbochef.This subjects food to a force about 50,000 timesthat of normal gravity,and oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock.You would not believe it!I perform a series of ghoulish experimentson food --in this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical modelso that one can predict exactlywhat the internal cooking times are.It turns out, A, it's useful, and for a geek like me, it's fun.Theory is red,black is experiment.So, I'm either really good at faking it,or this particular model seems to work.So, another random thing I dois the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,or SETI.And you may be familiar with the movie "Contact,"which sort of popularized that.It turns out there are real people who go outand search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.In fact, almost everybody in the movieis based on a real character, a real person.So, the Jodie Foster character hereis actually this woman, Jill Tarter,and Jill has dedicated her life to this.You know, a lot of people risk their livesin a brief act of heroism,which is kind of cool,but Jill haswhat I call slow heroism.She is risking her professional life on somethingthat her own calculations showmay not work for a thousand years -- may not ever.So, I like to support people that are risking their lives.After the movie came out, of course, there was a lot of interest in SETI.My kids saw the movie,and afterwards they came to me and they said,"So, Dad, so -- so --that character -- that's Jill, right?"I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah -- absolutely.""And that other person, that's someone -- " I said, "Yes."They said, "Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie?Is that you?"I said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on."(Laughter)So, the SETI Institute,with a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allenand a variety of other people,is building a dedicated radio telescopein Hat Creek, California,so they can do this SETI work.Now, I travel a lot, and I change cell phones a lot,and the one person who always gets updatedon all my cell phones and pagers and everything elseis Jill, because I really don't want to miss"the call."(Laughter)I mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home,and I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible!So, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.And I resemble that remark.I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs,which is the finding of them.Now, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditionslooking for a dinosaur.It sounds really dumb, but that's what it is.It's horrible conditions, becausewherever you have nice weather,plants grow,and you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs.So, you always find dinosaursin deserts or badlands,areas that have very little plant growthand have flash floods in the spring.You know, skiers pray for snow?Paleontologists pray for erosion.So, you hike aroundand -- this is after you dig them up, they look like this.You hike around, you see something like this.Now, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.You've got this bentonite clay,which is -- sort of swells up and expands.And there's some stuff poking out. So, you look at that,and you look up close, and you say,"Well, gee, that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?"Well, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually,from the shape, that these are skull fragments.And then when you look at this,you say, "That's a tooth.It's a big tooth."It's about the size of a banana.It has a big serration on the edge.This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground.And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex,which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago.Now, this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room.Not the same one, actually. This is a cast, which I had bought,and then, after buying the cast, I found my own,and I don't have room for two.You know.So, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaursis that it is both an intellectual thing,because you're trying to reconstruct the environmentof millions of years ago.It's something that can inform all sorts of sciencein unexpected ways.The study of dinosaurs led to the realizationthat there's a problem with asteroid impact,for example.The study of dinosaurs may, literally,one day save the planet.Study of the ancient climate is very important.In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,had much higher CO2 than today,was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof pointsfor the effects of CO2 on climate.But, besides being intellectuallyand scientifically interesting, it's also very differentthan the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.This is one of my papers: "A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod."It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex,so we're not going to go into it further.Now, I'm also really big on photography.I travel all over the world taking pictures --some of them good, most of them not.These days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that meansyou've got to spend more time sorting through them.Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islandsof king penguins on a beach.Here's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.I'd gone up to photograph Orcas,and we had looked for a week,and we hadn't seen a damn Orca.And the last day, the sun comes out,the Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic.And I get lots of pictures like this.Then, a little bit later,I start getting some pictures like this.Now, to a human audience, I need to explain thatif Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition,this would be the centerfold.It's true.So, there's more and more activity near the boat,and all of a sudden somebody shouts,"What's that in the water?"I said, "Well, I think that's what you call a free willy."(Laughter)There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.(Laughter)The first thing you learnis the overwhelming importance of hands.They don't have them.(Laughter)I think Paul Simon is in the audience,and he has --he may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex,"Slip-Slidin' Away."That's kind of what it's like.The other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex:they curl their toes too.(Laughter)So --where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together?You know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdomin finding a great thing, passion in life,and focusing all your energy on it,and I've never been able to do that.I just -- you know, because, yes,I'll focus passion on something,but then there will be something else, and then there's something else again.And for a long time I fought this, and I thought,"Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down."And you know, when I was at Microsoft,that was so engrossing,and the whole industry was expanding so much,that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life.But ultimately,I decidedthat what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am,but embrace it.And say, "Yeah, you know, I --this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep,but that's really what works for me."And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactorsor metamaterials or whale sex,the common -- or lowest common denominator -- is me.That's it, thank you.(Applause)

A few words about how I got started,and it has a lot to do with happiness, actually.When I was a very young child, I was extremely introvertedand very much to myself.And, kind of as a way of surviving,I would go into my own very personal space,and I would make things.I would make things for peopleas a way of, you know, giving, showing them my love.I would go into these private places,and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects --and sort of learning how to speak with my hands.So, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objectsis very much connected with not only the idea realm,but also with very much the feeling realm.And the ideas are very disparate.I'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces,and there's no real connection between one or the other,except that they sort of come out of my brain,and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggeredby looking at life, and seeing nature and seeing objects,and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things.When I was a child, I started to explore motion.I fell in love with the way things moved,so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks.And this is one that I did, probably like when I was around seventh grade,and I remember when I was doing this,I was thinking about that little rock there,and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air,and how the characters --(Laughter) --would come shooting out of the car,so, on my mind, I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles.And of course, when you're a little kid, there's always destruction.So, it has to end with this --(Laughter) --gratuitous violence.(Laughter)So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved,and expressed it.Now, when I went to college,I found myself making fairly complicated, fragile machines.And this really came aboutfrom having many different kinds of interests.When I was in high school, I loved to program computers,so I sort of liked the logical flow of events.I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgeryand becoming a surgeon,because it meant working with my handsin a very focused, intense way.So, I started taking art courses,and I found a way to make sculpturethat brought together my love for being very precise with my hands,with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system.And also, working with wire -- everything that I didwas both a visual and a mechanical engineering decisionat the same time.So, I was able to sort of exercise all of that.Now, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.And it's full of many little trivial end points,like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circlesand it doesn't really mean anything.It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality.The connection I have with engineeringis the same as any other engineer, in that I love to solve problems.I love to figure things out,but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous.(Laughter)That's pretty ambiguous.(Laughter)The next piece that is going to come upis an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex.I gave myself the problem.Since I'm always liking to solve problems,I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction,and solving all of the mechanical problemsfor getting this little man to walk back and forth.So, when I started this, I didn't have an overall plan for the machine,but I did have a sense of the gesture,and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space.And then it was a matter of starting from one pointand sort of building to that final point.That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction.And that's a little found object.So a lot of the pieces that I've made,they involve found objects.And it really -- it's almost like doing visual puns all the time.When I see objects, I imagine them in motion.I imagine what can be said with them.This next one here, "Machine with Wishbone,"it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner.You know, they say, never play with your food --but I always play with things.So, I had this wishbone, and I thought,it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long.(Laughter)And I started to make him walk across the table,and I thought, "Oh, I can make a little machine that will do that."So, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks.And because the wishbone is bone -- it's animal --it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it.And that's the whole piece.(Laughter)That's about that big.(Applause)This kind of work is also very much like puppetry,where the found object is, in a sense, the puppet,and I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object.But then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me,and it is able to achieve the action that I want.The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought,and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair."I had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair,and I saw it explode up and out.And --so the way I saw this in my mind at first,was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed,and the pieces would move far out,and then they would begin to be pulled backwith a kind of a gravitational feel,to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center.And they would coalesce for just a moment,so you could perceive that there was a chair there.For me, it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment,and I wanted to express that.Now, the machine is -- in this case, it's a real approximation of that,because obviously you can't move physical matterinfinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously.This whole thing is about four feet wide,and the chair itself is only about a few inches.(Applause)Now, this is a funny sort of conceptual thing,and yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis' "10,000 Year Clock."So, we have a motor here on the left,and it goes through a gear train.There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions,so that means that the final speed of that gear on the endis so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.So I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter.(Laughter)Because it could run all the time.(Laughter)Now, a completely different thought.I'm always imagining myself in different situations.I'm imagining myself as a machine.What would I love?I would love to be bathed in oil.(Laughter)So, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil.(Laughter)(Applause)And it's really, just sort of --for me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil.(Laughter)And then, I got a call from a friendwho wanted to have a show of erotic art,and I didn't have any pieces.But when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.So, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.And this one I call "Machine with Grease."It's just continually ejaculating, and it's --(Laughter) --this is a happy machine, I'll tell you.(Laughter)It's definitely happy.From an engineering point of view,this is just a little four-bar linkage.And then again, this is a found object, a little fan that I found.And I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan,and how simply could I state something.And, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clearbut also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant.For me, the process is very important,because I'm inventing machines,but I'm also inventing tools to make machines,and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning.So this is a little wire-bending tool.After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers,I made that tool, and then I made this other toolfor sort of centering gears very quickly --sort of developing my own little world of technology.My life completely changed when I found a spot welder.(Laughter)And that was that tool.It completely changed what I could do.Now here, I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering.This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school.I just like, throw it in.I mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in.So, that's a finished gear.When I moved to Boston,I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society.(Laughter)And the idea, their premise was that we wanted to showpieces of sculpture on the street,and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.(Laughter)So I made -- this is my first racing sculpture,and I thought, "Oh, I'm going to make a cart,and I'm going to have it --I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,'so as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to meand it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' "So, that's what it does.(Laughter)But then in the end, what I decidedwas every time you finish writing the word,I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road.So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping.But I had a lot of fun.(Applause)Now, I only have two and a half minutes -- I'm going to play this.This is a piece that, for me, is in some waysthe most complete kind of piece.Because when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar.And when I had this thought,I was imagining that I would make --I would have a whole machine theater evening,where I would -- you would have an audience,the curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage.So, I imagined a very simple gestural dancethat would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ...When I'm making these pieces, I'm always trying to find a pointwhere I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple,but also at the same time it's very ambiguous.And I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguitywhich can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it.And that leads me to the thought that all of these piecesstart off in my own mind, in my heart,and I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials,and it always feels really crude.It's always a struggle,but somehow I manage to sort of get this thoughtout into an object, and then it's there, OK.It means nothing at all.The object itself just means nothing.Once it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind,then there's a cycle that has been completed.And to me, that's the most important thingbecause, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love.And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside,out to the physical, to someone perceiving it.So I'll just let this chair come down.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)

How does the news shape the way we see the world?Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass.And here's how news shapes what Americans see.This map -- (Applause) -- this map shows the number of secondsthat American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories,by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago.Now, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.There was massive flooding in Indonesia.And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage.And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent,we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else.The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent.When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story,here's how the world looked.What was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith.This story eclipsed every country except Iraq,and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report.And the cycle continues;as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately.So, why don't we hear more about the world?One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half.Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai,there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America-- places that are home to more than two billion people.The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbingwhen we see where people go for news.Local TV news looms large,and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.And what about the web?The most popular news sites don't do much better.Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 storiesthat appeared on Google News' front page.And they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events.Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creatorsis recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters,and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it.So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates,as well as less educated Americans,know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago.And if you think it's simply because we are not interested,you would be wrong.In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the timegrew to over 50 percent.The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americansin our increasingly interconnected world?I know we can do better.And can we afford not to? Thank you.

I started juggling a long time ago,but long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer.And as a golfer and as a kid,one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores,that I sort of lived my whole life, is process.And it's the process of learning things.One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty.And he had a real passion for golf,and he also created this whole mythologyabout Ben Hogan and various things.Well, I learned a lot about interesting thingsthat I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about.And that was the mythology of skill.So, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music --I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machoverwith the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music.But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere,I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.But I'm going to explore skill, and juggling,and basically visual music, I guess.OK, you can start the music, thanks.(Music)(Applause)Thanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun;play with skill and play with space, play with rhythm.And you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces.I do a big piece in a triangleand these are three sections from it.Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and spaceusing not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented --but using the rhythm of my body and feet,and controlling the balls with my feet.(Applause)Thanks. Now, this next section was an attempt to explore space.You see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something.Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff.Well, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that,it's a process of joining with forces.And so what I'd like to do is try to figure outhow to join with the space through the technique.So juggling gravity -- up, down.If you figure out what up and down really are,it's a complex physical set of skillsto be able to throw a ball down and up and everything,but then you add in sideways.(Applause)Now, I look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn jugglingwhat you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your handsbecause you're not looking at your hands,you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience.So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm,with the obvious reference to the feet,but it's also time -- where the feet were, where the balls were.(Applause)Thanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity.I'm going to build towards complexity now.Juggling three balls is simple and normal.(Laughter)Excuse me.(Laughter)We're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing,you're getting into a subculture here.(Laughter)And juggling -- the balls cross and all that.OK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel linesof different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm.And you can change the rhythm -- good, Michael.You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.OK? Change the rhythm, so it's even.Or you can go back and change the height. Now, skill.But you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way.So, you've got to go after the space down there.OK, then you've got to combine them,because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you.And then you get crazy.(Applause)Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something,so you've got to pay attention. Complexity:if you spend enough time doing something, time slows downor your skill increases, so your perceptions change.It's learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash.Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.You may not be able to affect it, it almost drifts on you. It goes.But that's the closest approximation I can have to it.So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers?OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.OK? And whoever laughed there --you understood it completely, right?(Laughter)No, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there,who's got his hands around that mess, OK.Well, that's what juggling is about, right?It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.All right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down.OK? Another way is the outside.And you could play with the rhythm.Same pattern.Make it faster and smaller.Make it wider.Make it narrower.Bring it back up.OK. It's done. Thanks.(Applause)Now, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile.I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are,but let's try something.OK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is,I'm going to give you a little clue.Enough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK.(Laughter)You're not getting off that easy. All right?Now, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow.Green.Yellow.Pink.White.OK, you can do that? Yeah? OK.Now, let's actually learn something.Actually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure.You want to do it? Yeah? OK.Hands out in front of you. Palms up, together.What you're going to learn is this.(Laughter)OK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it.Index finger, middle finger, ring, little.Little, ring, middle, index. And then open.Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.A little bit faster.Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.(Laughter)All right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here.(Laughter)One learning process that I see is this --(Laughter)OK. Another learning process that I see is this --(Laughter)OK. So, everybody take a deep breath in, breath out. OK.Now, one more time, and --finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open.Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. OK.Shake your hands out.Now, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer.OK? So, what you're doing is, you're going la, la, la,and you're getting this. OK?So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do,but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it.So what I want you to do is -- fingers.I'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing.But I want you to do is also, with your eyes,is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow.(Laughter)OK? Here we go.So, we're going to start off looking at the white ball --and I'm going to tell you which color,and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK?So white ball and --finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink.Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Green.Finger, finger, finger, finger. Yellow.Finger, finger, finger, pink or finger.Pink, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.All right.(Applause)How did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this isbecause that's actually what most people face throughout their lives,a moment of learning, a moment of challenge.It's a moment that you can't make sense of.Why the hell should I learn this? OK?Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life?You know, I can't decipher -- is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat?(Laughter)You know, what are you supposed to do?You've got somebody up here who is the operative principleof doing that for his whole life. OK?Trying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere?It's just a moment. That's all it is, a moment. OK?I'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this.I don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment.There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that,a moment. And what I do as a creative artistis I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects.What I've done for you here, I developed a lot of those tricksand I put the choreography together,but they're not original techniques.Now, I'm going to start showing you some original techniquesthat come from the work that I've developed. OK?So, a moment, how would you define a moment?Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create somethingthat was representational of a moment.Ahhh.All right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it.So, a moment.(Rattling)OK? And then, what I did as a juggler was say,OK, what can I do to make that somethingthat is dependent on something else, another dynamic.(Rattling)So, a moment.(Rattling)Another moment.(Rattling)Excuse me, still getting there. A moment that travels.(Rattling)A moment -- no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together.Time. How can you look at time?And what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing?Well, obviously, there's something in here,and you can all have a guess as to what it is.There's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment.And it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else.And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time.Now, this has expanded into a much bigger piece,because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls onwhile I'm keeping time with this.But I just thought I'd talk about a moment.(Applause)All right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle?Are we ready to do that? Yes?This is the piece that I told you about.It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.(Applause)Thanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is,you ever try juggling and driving the car with your kneesat 120 miles an hour?(Laughter)The only other thing is, it was a real shock.I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked methat it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting.Anyway, balance:constant movement to find an approach to stillness.Cheating.(Laughter)Balance: making up the rules so you can't cheat,so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body.To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen.(Laughter)Hup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm,and keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath.So, there's a rhythm to it.The rhythm can get much smaller.As your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces,those tinier movements. Thanks.(Applause)Now, I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piecethat is about balance in some ways, and also --oh, actually, if you're bored, not here, here's one use for it.(Laughter)You can go with the "Sticks One" music.(Music)(Applause)Thanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb.I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level.And they influenced that, and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of."Two Sticks," you can go with it. Thanks.Which is again exploring space, or the lines in space.(Music)(Applause)Working with space and the lines in space in a different way.Oh, let's see here.(Applause)So, I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball,now, what if you attach something to it, or change it.This is a little thing that I madebecause I really like the idea of curves and balls together.And then creating space and the rhythm of space,using the surface of the balls, the surface of the arms.Just a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing,which is --what have I got here? OK. All right.I'm actually leading up to something,the newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it.This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape.(Applause)Now, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics --the diameter and the circumference.Sometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that waythat I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this.Sometimes what happens in life affects my choiceof objects that I try to work with.The next piece that I'm going to do -- which is the cylinders piece,if you want to get that up --it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago,which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet claywith all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that.It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape,and the stories that were involved in it,as well as the fact that they protected the contents.The second influence on this piece came from recyclingand looking into a tin can recycling binand seeing all that beautiful emptiness.So, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.(Music)(Applause)Talking about geometry and everything,if you take the circle and you split it in half --can you run "S-Curve music?"I'm going to do just a short version of it.Circles split in half and rotated, and mythology.(Music)(Applause)Anyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it,and I dance around a small stage so --two minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on --what I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it.They're not ideas, they're instincts.And the latest thing that I'm working on --(Clattering) --is something really -- I don't know what it is yet.And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible.Well, because then it tells me the truth,instead of me imposing the truth.And what it is, is working with both positive and negative spacebut also with these curves.And what it involves,and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not,but I'll do a little bit of it.It initially started off with me stacking these things,bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space,of filling in the space. And then it started changing,and become folding on themselves.And then changing levels.Because my attempt is to make visual instruments,not to just make -- I'll try one other thing.For work in three dimensions, with your perceptions of space and time.Now, I don't know exactly where it's going,but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing.And it's going to change as I go through it.But I really like it, it feels right.This may not be the right shape, and -- look at this shape,and then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it,just to see, just to play,because I love all different kinds of things to play with.Let's see here.To work with the positive and negative in a different way.And to change, and to change.So, I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space.We'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me.(Applause)

The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years oldand I got a B+. (Laughter)What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.And I'm gonna try and do that withinthe 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within,and to follow the TED commandments:that is, actually, something that createsa near-death experience,but near-death is good for creativity.(Laughter) OK.So, I also want to explain,because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle meif I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily;I mean me, and my right brain, my left brainand the one that's in between that is the censorand tells me what I'm saying is wrong.And I'm going do that also by looking atwhat I think is part of my creative process,which includes a number of things that happened, actually --the nothing started even earlier than the momentin which I'm creating something new.And that includes nature, and nurture,and what I refer to as nightmares.Now in the nature area, we look at whether or notwe are innately equipped with something, perhapsin our brains, some abnormal chromosomethat causes this muse-like effect.And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.And others, like my mother,would say that I get my material from past lives.Some people would also say that creativitymay be a function of some other neurological quirk --van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.I do have to say, somebody -- I read recentlythat van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic,that he might have had temporal lobe seizures,and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't --I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.And I will mention that I actually developedtemporal lobe seizures a number of years ago,but it was during the time I was writing my last book,and some people say that book is quite different.I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis:you know, who am I, why am I this particular person,why am I not black like everybody else?And sometimes you're equipped with skills,but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist.And I had a miniature poodle.And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be,and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad,but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day makemy living out of the artful arrangement of words.Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had,and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.That figure right there, by the way,figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old,and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15,this was supposed to be my side occupation,and it led to a sense of failure.But actually, there was something quite real in my lifethat happened when I was about 14.And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father,six months later, had brain tumors.And my mother believed that something had gone wrong,and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles,and that God's will would take care of that.But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses-- she went looking through all the reasons in the universewhy this would have happened.Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness.There was a reason for everything.And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother,who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.And so, I had this notion of death all around me,because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon,you begin to think very much about everything.You become very creative, in a survival sense.And this, then, led to my big questions.And they're the same ones that I have today.And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300,you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen,in what order they happen. What are the influences?How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe,as the creator of that universe.And you see, there's a lot of back and forthin trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out-- years and years, oftentimes.So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inabilityto repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.And I got a lot of them during what's been going onthroughout this conference,almost everything that's been going on.And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association:quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand,but I'm still gonna use it as the processfor explaining how it is the metaphor.So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.But when you make those associations,you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story,and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning.And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics,as I understand it. (Laughter)And this happens constantly in the writing.And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect,in which you're looking for something, andyou know, things are happening simultaneously,and you're looking at it in a different way,and you're trying to really look for the about-ness,or what is this story about. And if you try too hard,then you will only write the about.You won't discover anything.And what you were supposed to find,what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way,is no longer there.Now, I don't want to ignorethe other side of what happens in our universe,like many of our scientists have.And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here,and just say that creative people are multidimensional,and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.(Laughter) And they all operate at the same time.There is also a big question of ambiguity.And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortablein my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.It is constantly there. And, just as an example,this is one that recently came to me.It was something I read in an editorial by a womanwho was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said,"Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."A very famous Chinese saying, she said.And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay thereuntil things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.So, there was another one that I came across,and it's "saving fish from drowning."And it's what Buddhist fishermen say,because they're not supposed to kill anything.And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning,and unfortunately, in the process the fish die.Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors-- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation,and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me:"save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business,or you're going to get stuck.OK. I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning,or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions.And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.And then we have intentions.There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do,and then we do something.And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.Maybe things go wrong. And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?What are we supposed to do?Do we stay in for life,or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good,and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?That is the ambiguity in my lifethat really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called"Saving Fish From Drowning."I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.I got these hints everywhere.And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.And then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues,and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.And what I need, in effect, is a focus.And when I have the question, it is a focus.And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go throughthat question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.And it seems like it's happening all the time.You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity,in which you're getting all this help from the universe.And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.And you are noticing it more often.But you apply this.You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?Why or why not?It may be something that is perhaps more serious-- as I said, human rights in Burma.I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would showthat I approved of the military regime there.And then, after a while, I had to ask myself,"Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptionsthat other people have given us?"And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up,and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father,who was a Baptist minister.So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions,and still didn't know that if I went there,what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book --and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals,so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at,and we talked about today, is genocide.This leads to this question.When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable,and I consider what my intentions should be,I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child-- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life,and what is my place in the universe?It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense,and yet it is also absolutely necessary.In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book,because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally,from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time,I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself,and that actually was the way it happened.And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.There are also things, quite uncanny,which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.In this case, I was writing a storythat included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.And I needed to find something historically that would match that.And I took down this book, and I --first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period,and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion,happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that,and a character who thought he was the son of God.You wonder, are these things random chance?Well, what is random? What is chance? What is luck?What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?And that goes into the story, too.These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.Especially when good things happen,and, in particular, when bad things happen.But I do think there's a kind of serendipity,and I do want to know what those elements are,so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.Another chance encounter is when I went to a place-- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place,and we ended up in this non-tourist location,a beautiful village, pristine.And we walked three valleys beyond,and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous,a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building.And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs,that I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later,walking along the beach, I came across this.And it was a man, a Chinese man,and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story,and I cannot explain it.Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidencein writing about these things?Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?A big thing that I also think about is accidents.And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.What is the nature of accidents?And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are,outside of a court of law?I was able to see that in a firsthand way,when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked meif I wanted to write anything about China.And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went,there was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep,and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.Responsibility was assigned to the family.The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.It's the son, not the father."When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.And I began to sense something different about the history,and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village,and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your linkswith other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using,a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men-- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners,would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while,and seeing the amazing things that happened,you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world,determining how things happen.So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story,the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me-- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real,and that is where I'm gonna find the answersto how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly,as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?And how do I create my own life?And I think it is by questioning,and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.I believe in specifics, the specifics of story,and the past, the specifics of that past,and what is happening in the story at that point.I also believe that in thinking about things --my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents,God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces --I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe,and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined --and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.And they have to be in all possibilities,including those I never considered before.So, there are never complete answers.Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remindmyself that there is uncertainty in everything,and that is good, because then I will discover something new.And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me,it is to simply imagine.And to imagine is to put myself in that story,until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story-- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think,to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.Because for everything,in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.We've come to the end of the talk,and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse,and it is the things that transform in our lives,that are wonderful and stay with us.There she is.Thank you very much!(Applause)

The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we alllove music a great deal. It means a lot to us.But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect --the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years --that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero],that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent.Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it,but everybody, each of us, everybody in the worldhas the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way,and that's one of the main parts of my work.So, with the MIT Media Lab, for quite a while now,we've been engaged in a field called active music.What are all the possible ways that we can think ofto get everybody in the middle of a musical experience,not just listening, but making music?And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers --we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince,orchestras, rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensorsbuilt right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played.And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling,I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra,or into something that nobody has ever heard before.When we started making these, I started thinking, why can't we makewonderful instruments like that for everybody,people who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes?So, we've made a whole series of instruments.One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.It's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments,all designed for anybody to play using natural skill.So, you can play a video game, drive through a piece of music,use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound,touch a special surface to make melodies, use your voice to make a whole aura.And when we make the Brain Opera, we invite the public to come in,to try these instruments and then collaborate with usto help make each performance of the Brain Opera.We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna,where we built a museum around it.And that led to something which you probably do know.Guitar Hero came out of our lab,and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Labare proof that if you make the right kind of interface,people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music,and playing it over and over and over again.So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg,because my second idea is that it's not enough just to wantto make music in something like Guitar Hero.And music is very fun, but it's also transformative.It's very, very important.Music can change your life, more than almost anything.It can change the way you communicate with others,it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're tryingto go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.We are very involved in education. We have a long-term projectcalled Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive,but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music,want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works,how to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments,like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers,Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm,and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends,who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing --and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and colorto make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use, but once you use it,you can go quite deep -- music in any style. And then, by pressing a button,it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.We've had good enough, really, very powerful effects with kidsaround the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore.So, we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activitiesin a much broader context, for all kinds of peoplewho don't usually have the opportunity to make music.So, one of the growing fields that we're working onat the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called"Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.If you haven't seen it, it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself,and he details his whole career of looking at and observingincredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations.So we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thingthat people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones,you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror,or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of musicthat that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with thatyou can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes,movement to people with Parkinson's disease.It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things.So, we're working on understanding those underlying principlesand then building activities which will let music really improve people's health.And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals.One of them is right near Boston, called Tewksbury Hospital.It's a long-term state hospital, where several years agowe started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities.This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital,so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities.It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the mostand it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community.I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.Video: They're manipulating each other's rhythms.It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms,but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.To get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it,to experiment with it, to make their own music.So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly.Everybody can experience music in a profound way,we just have to make different tools.The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically,I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we haveof showing who we really are. I love giving talks, althoughstrangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.If I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you,I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words,more personal things, perhaps deeper things.I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examplesof how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have,from ourselves to the outside world.The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, calledDeath and the Powers. And it's a big opera,one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.And it's about a man, rich, successful, powerful, who wants to live forever.So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment,actually into a series of books.So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment.The main singer disappears at the beginning of the operaand the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy.And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others,to the people we love, and what we can't.Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument,like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier,but it's actually a robotic music instrument.So, as you can see in this prototype, gigantic piano strings,each string is controlled with a little robotic element --either little bows that stroke the strings, propellers that tickle the strings,acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage.These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers,and his family. There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus.They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right nowat MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music.They follow the characters. They're smart enough, we hope,not to bump into each other. They go off on their own.And then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to.Even though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality.The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books.Every single book is robotic, so they all move, they all make sound,and when you put them all together, they turn into these walls,which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared,but the whole physical environment becomes this person.This is how he's chosen to represent himself.The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display.And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System.This is a sneak preview.This premieres in Monaco -- it's in September 2009. If by any chance you can't make it,another idea with this project -- here's this guy building his legacythrough this very unusual form, through music and through the environment.But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces,as a way of each of us to use music and images from our livesto make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love.So instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we'rethinking of as personal opera.And, if you're going to make a personal opera, what about a personal instrument?Everything I've shown you so far -- whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Maor squeezy toy for a child -- the instruments stayed the same and are valuablefor a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child.But what if I could make an instrument that could be adaptedto the way I personally behave, to the way my hands work,to what I do very skillfully, perhaps, to what I don't do so skillfully?I think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments.And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage,so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.So, can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger, Ph.D. student fromthe MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey. Dan,thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet, Dan is here with us todayall the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital.This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that,because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music.So, first of all, Dan, do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are?Dan Ellsey: Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am 34 years old and I have cerebral palsy.I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conductmy own music with this new software.Tod Machover: And we're really excited to have you here, really Dan. (Applause)So we met Dan about three years ago, three and a half years ago,when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic,did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before, and it turned outhe was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer.He's very shy, too.So, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has beena constant collaborator of ours. He has made many, many pieces.He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area --mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music.And I'll let Adam tell you. So, Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT, an expert in musictechnology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators.What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Danbe able easily to make his own pieces,but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument.So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work?Adam Boulanger: Yes. So, Tod and I entered into a discussionfollowing the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressiveperson, and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face,it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't performone of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense.So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance,with precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that,to be able to perform his piece of music.So, the process and the technology --basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know,we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used towith his speaking controller.And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know,the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking;in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making.But, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part,where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospitalextensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move?What's useful to him as an expressive motion?You know, what's his metaphor for performance?What types of things does he findimportant to control and convey in a piece of music?So all the parameter fitting, and really the technologywas stretched at that point to fit just Dan.And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies --they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work.But what about expression? What about that moment when an artist deliversthat piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express?Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationshipto expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know,with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering processto sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform.And so that's what we'll do today.TM: So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyoneabout what you're going to play now?DE: This is "My Eagle Song."TM: So Dan is going to play a piece of his, called "My Eagle Song".In fact, this is the score for Dan's piece,completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore.So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore.He's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact.(Laughter)TM: He's really modest, too.So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms.He can place those exactly where he wants.Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window,draws the lines, places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore,you can see it also, you can see where the sections are,something might continue for a while, change, get really crazy and then endup with a big bang at the end.So that's the way he made his piece, and as Adam says,we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece.It's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements,it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to.And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen.We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.But instead of making it very literal, showing you exactlythe camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basicmovement, and shows the way it's being analyzed.I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from whatDan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement,that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise,very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.So, in hearing this piece, as I mentioned before, the most important thing isthe music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is.So, are we ready Adam?AB: Yeah.TM: OK, now Dan will play his piece "My Eagle Song" for you.(Applause)TM: Bravo.(Applause)

I’m working a lot with motion and animation,and also I'm an old DJ and a musician.So, music videos are something that I always found interesting,but they always seem to be so reactive.So I was thinking, can you remove us as creatorsand try to make the music be the voiceand have the animation following it?So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track --many of you probably know it. It’s about 25 years old,and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno --and we did this little animation.And I think that it's maybe interesting, also,that it deals with two problematic issues,which are rising waters and religion.Song: Before God destroyed the people on the Earth,he warned Noah to build an Ark.And after Noah built his Ark,I believe he told Noah to warn the peoplethat they must change all their wicked waysbefore he come upon them and destroy them.And when Noah had done built his Ark,I understand that somebody began to rend a song.And the song began to move on I understand like this.And when Noah had done built his Ark ...Move on ... In fact ... Concern ...So they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired.And then he went and knocked an old lady house.And old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?"Jack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here?Because we’re far from home, we’re very tired."And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in."It was come dark and rain, will make you weary and tired.(Applause)

Good morning.Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.We're all familiar with his fantastic work --his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.But we do not know his face.Thousands of books have been written about him,but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians.So, what do you think?Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?Let's find out.Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.But no faces?I find that hard to believe.His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here --en face or three-quarters.So, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardomust have made self-portraits from time to time.So let's try to find them.I think that if we were to scan all of his workand look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700,and looked for male portraits.There are about 120, you see them here.Which ones of these could be self-portraits?Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.So we can eliminate all the profiles.It also has to be sufficiently detailed.So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.And we know from his contemporariesthat Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.(Laughter)And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill.And here they are.Yes, indeed, the old man is there,as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, "The Musician."Before we go into these faces,I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.I've made more than 1,100 portraits myselffor newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only.(Laughter)But there are 1,100, and very few artists have drawn so many faces.So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.OK, now let's look at these three portraits.And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces,remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows,the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that.There is no reason why these portraits should look alike.All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait,and look, they are very similar.Now, are they made in the right order?The young man should be made first.And as you see here from the years that they were created,it is indeed the case.They are made in the right order.What was the age of Leonardo at the time? Does that fit?Yes, it does. He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made.So we have three pictures, potentially of the same personof the same age as Leonardo at the time.But how do we know it's him, and not someone else?Well, we need a reference.And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.It's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David,for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15.And if we now compare the face of the statue,with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardoto those three faces.Ladies and gentlemen, this story has not yet been published.It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first.The icon of icons finally has a face.Here he is: Leonardo da Vinci.(Applause)

Thank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular.I cannot believe I'm here.I have not slept in weeks.Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've sleptin anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous --and I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized. (Laughter)So, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organizationcalled 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talkabout how we all might join in and do similar things.Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn,I was trying to finish my first book,I was wandering around dazed every daybecause I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.So I would walk around in a daze during the day.I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day, but I had flexible hours.In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope,there are a lot of writers --it's like a very high per capita ratioof writers to normal people.Meanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers.My mom was a teacher, my sister became a teacherand after college so many of my friends went into teaching.And so I was always hearing them talk about their livesand how inspiring they were,and they were really sort of the most hard-workingand constantly inspiring people I knew.But I knew so many of the things they were up against,so many of the struggles they were dealing with.And one of them was that so many of my friendsthat were teaching in city schools were having troublewith their students keeping up at grade level,in their reading and writing in particular.Now, so many of these students had come from householdswhere English isn't spoken in the home,where a lot of them have different special needs,learning disabilities. And of course they're working in schoolswhich sometimes and very often are under-funded.And so they would talk to me about this and say,"You know, what we really need is just more people,more bodies, more one-on-one attention,more hours, more expertise from peoplethat have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one."Now, I would say, "Well, why don't you just work with them one-on-one?"And they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each.This can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.How can we possibly give each studenteven one hour a week of one-on-one attention?"You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.And so we started talking about this.And at the same time,I thought about this massive group of people I knew:writers, editors, journalists, graduate students,assistant professors, you name it.All these people that had sort of flexible daily hoursand an interest in the English word --I hope to have an interest in the English language,but I'm not speaking it well right now. (Laughter)I'm trying. That clock has got me.But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written wordin terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.And so they had, you know, their timeand their interest, but at the same timethere wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my communityto bring these two communities together.So when I moved back to San Francisco, we rented this building.And the idea was to put McSweeney's --McSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year,and a few other magazines --we were going to move it into an office for the first time.It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn.We were going to move it into an office,and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center.So we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody --sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway,why don't we just open upthe front of the building for students to come in there after school,get extra help on their written homework,so you have basically no border between these two communities?"So the idea was that we would beworking on whatever we're working on,at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing,or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.You give those hours in the afternoonto the students in the neighborhood.So, we had this place, we rented it,the landlord was all for it. We did this mural,that's a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire historyof the printed word, in mural form -- it takes a long timeto digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road.So we rented this space.And everything was great except the landlord said,"Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something.You've gotta sell something.You can't just have a tutoring center."So we thought, "Ha ha! Really!"And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell,but we did all the necessary research.It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below,acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors,whitewashed beams and it had the look --while we were renovating this place, somebody said,"You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship."And we looked around and somebody else said,"Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer." (Laughter)And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh,and we said, "There's a point to that.Let's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store.You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see,we made it look sort of pirate supply-like.Here you see planks sold by the footand we have supplies to combat scurvy.We have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.Up at the top, you see the eyepatch display,which is the black column there for everyday usefor your eyepatch, and then you have the pasteland other colors for stepping out at night --special occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever.So we opened this place. And this is a vatthat we fill with treasures that students dig in.This is replacement eyes in case you lose one.These are some signs that we have all over the place:"Practical Joking with Pirates."While you're reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counterand eight mop heads drop on your head.That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads.It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater,which is just a saltwater tank with three seats,and then right behind it we set up this space,which was the tutoring center.So right there is the tutoring center,and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices,where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that.The kids would come in --or we thought they would come in. I should back up.We set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and monthsrenovating this place.We had tables, chairs, computers, everything.I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Altoand I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle.Anyway, we bought 'em, we set everything up and then we waited.It was started with about 12 of my friends,people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood.And we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalkand it just said, "Free Tutoring for Your English-Relatedand Writing-Related Needs -- Just Come In, It's All Free."And we thought, "Oh, they're going to storm the gates,they're gonna love it." And they didn't.And so we waited, we sat at the tables, we waited and waited.And everybody was becoming very discouragedbecause it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in.And then somebody alerted us to the factthat maybe there was a trust gap,because we were operating behind a pirate supply store. (Laughter)We never put it together, you know?And so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari,a longtime San Francisco educator --she was teaching in Mexico City,she had all the experience necessary,knew everything about education,was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood --I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching.She took over as executive director.Immediately, she made the inroads with the teachersand the parents and the students and everything,and so suddenly it was actually full every day.And what we were trying to offer every daywas one-on-one attention.The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students.You know, it's been proventhat 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention,a student can get one grade level higher.And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.They come there, many times their parents --you can't see it, but there's a church pewthat I bought in a Berkeley auction right there --the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored.So that was the basis of it,was one-on-one attention.And we found ourselves full every day with kids.If you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m.,2:30 p.m., you will get run over, often,by the kids and their big backpacks, or whatever, actually running to this space,which is very strange, because it's school, in a way.But there was something psychological happening therethat was just a little bit different.And the other thing was, there was no stigma.Kids weren't going into the "Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help,"or something like that. It was 826 Valencia.First of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane.And then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back.And so our interns were actually workingat the same tables very often,and shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students.And so it became a tutoring center --publishing center, is what we called it --and a writing center.They go in, and they might be working with a high school studentactually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids, too.So there's no stigma.They're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor.They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior.These adults, they're working in their field.They can lean over, ask a question of one of these adultsand it all sort of feeds on each other.There's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem,especially for the adults working at McSweeney'swho hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up,was that there was just the one bathroom. (Laughter)With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.But you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homeworkin a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention --they go home, they're finished. They don't stall.They don't do their homework in front of the TV.They're allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family,enjoy other hobbies, get outside, play.And that makes a happy family.A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world.So the key to it all is homework! (Laughter) (Applause)There you have it, you know -- one-on-one attention.So we started off with about 12 volunteers,and then we had about 50,and then a couple hundred.And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.The key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month,those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder,next to one student, concentrated attention,shining this beam of light on their work,on their thoughts and their self-expression,is going to be absolutely transformative,because so many of the students have not had that ever before.So we said, "Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months,it doesn't matter. That's going to be enough."So that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast.Then we said, "Well, what are wegoing to do with the space during the day,because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?"So we started bringing in classes during the day.So every day, there's a field trip where they together create a book --you can see it being typed up above.This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing.You just point a camera at a class,and it always looks like this.So this is one of the books that they do.Notice the title of the book,"The Book That Was Never Checked Out: Titanic."And the first line of that book is, "Once there was a book named Cindythat was about the Titanic."So, meanwhile, there's an adult in the back typing this up,taking it completely seriously, which blows their mind.So then we still had more tutors to use.This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.The teachers that we work with --and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do.We went in there thinking,"We're ultimately, completely malleable. You're going to tell us.The neighborhood's going to tell us, the parents are going to tell us.The teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful."So then they said, "Why don't you come into the schools?Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you,necessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in,or aren't close enough?" So then we started saying,"Well, we've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster.Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say,"I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays.We're working on our college essays. Send them in."So we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.The teacher tells them what to do,how to do it, what their training is, what their project is so far.They work under the teacher's guide,and it's all in one big room.And that's actually the brunt of what we do is,people going straight from their workplace, straight from home,straight into the classroom andworking directly with the students.So then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students.Then another school said, "Well, what if wejust give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?"So this is the Everett Middle School Writers' Room,where we decorated it in buccaneer style.It's right off the library. And there we serveall 529 kids in this middle school.This is their newspaper, the "Straight-Up News,"that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsomin both languages -- English and Spanish.So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said,"Hey, why don't you assign a book with high school students?I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world."And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School,which is a school that we had worked with on some other things,and we gave that assignment to the students.And we said, "Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end.She's going to publish them in a book.She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Areaand throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it."So these kids worked harderthan they've ever worked on anything in their lives,because there was that outside audience,there was Isabel Allende on the other end.I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with themand so this worked out incredibly well.We had a big party at the end.This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these.You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one,"I Might Get Somewhere."And this became an ongoing thing. More and more books.Now we're sort of addicted to the book thing.The kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their lifeif they know it's going to be permanent,know it's going to be on a shelf,know that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said,that we've honored their words, honored their thoughtswith hundreds of hours of five drafts, six drafts --all this attention that we give to their thoughts.And once they achieve that level, once they've written at that level,they can never go back.It's absolutely transformative.And so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks.We sell all the student books.Where else would you put them, right?So we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happeningwith the stores. The store, actually --even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money.So it was paying the rent.And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing --I don't know, I don't want to judge.But people would come in --and this was before the pirate movies and everything!It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money,but it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there.There's the ocean maps you can see on the left.And it became a gateway to the community.People would come in and say, "What the --?What is this?" I don't want to swear on the web. (Laughter)Is that a rule? I don't know.They would say, "What is this?"And people would come in and learn more about it.And then right beyond -- there's usually a little chain there --right beyond, they would see the kids being tutored.This is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping,and they might be more likely to buy some lard,or millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook,or hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell.So the store actually did really well.But it brought in so many people --teachers, donors, volunteers, everybody --because it was street level. It was open to the public.It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floorof some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhoodthat it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.So, it became this sort of weird, happy accident.So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said,"Well, why don't we have a place like that here?"And a lot of them had been former educatorsor would-be educators, so they combinedwith a lot of local designers, local writers,and they just took the idea independentlyand they did their own thing.They didn't want to sell pirate supplies.They didn't think that that was going to work there.So, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York,they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company.This is Sam Potts' great design that did this.And this was to make it look sort of like one of thosekeysmith's shops that has to have every servicethey've ever offered, you know, all over there.So they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costcofor superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form.These are all handmade.These are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.All the packaging is done by Sam Potts.So then you have the villain containment unit,where kids put their parents. You have the office.This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there,it goes up an electric liftand then the guy behind the counter tells youthat you have to recite the vow of heroism,which you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.Personally, I think it's a problem.Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything.These are some of the products. These are all handmade.This is a secret identity kit.If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone,one American female marketing executivefrom Hoboken, New Jersey. It's a full dossieron everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone.So, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape,and then you walk up these three steel-graded stepsand then we turn on three hydraulic fansfrom every side and then you can see the cape in action.There's nothing worse than, you know,getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.So then, the secret door --this is one of the shelves you don't seewhen you walk in, but it slowly opens.You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks.It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back. (Applause)So you can see the full effect!But this is -- I just want to emphasize --locally funded, locally built.All the designers, all of the builders,everybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.I just came and visited and said, "Yes, you guys are doing great,"or whatever. That was it. You can see the timein all five boroughs of New York in the back. (Laughter) (Applause)So this is the space during tutoring hours.It's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention,complete devotion to the students' workand a boundless optimism and sort of a possibilityof creativity and ideas.And this switch is flicked in their headswhen they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right?So it's school, but it's not school.It's clearly not school, even thoughthey're working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables, pencils and papers, whatever.This is one of the students, Khaled Hamdan.You can read this quote.Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home.Came in. Got this concentrated attention.And he couldn't escape it.So, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early --got really addicted to finishing his homework early.It's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it,and to have it checked, and to know he's going to achievethe next thing and be prepared for school the next day.So he got hooked on that, and then he started doing other things.He's now been published in five books.He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroescalled "Super-Has-Beens."He wrote a series on "Penguin Balboa,"which is a fighting -- a boxing -- penguin.And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space,at a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day.He's evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now.There's four family members that come in every day.So, I'll go through really quickly.This is L.A., The Echo Park Time Travel Mart:"Whenever You Are, We're Already Then." (Laughter)This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers.So you see everything: it's exactly as a 7-Eleven would be.Leeches. Mammoth chunks. They even have their own Slurpee machine:"Out of Order. Come Back Yesterday." (Laughter) (Applause)Anyway. So I'm going to jump ahead.These are spaces that are only affiliated with us,doing this same thing: Word St. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts;Ink Spot in Cincinnati; Youth Speaks, San Francisco, California,which inspired us; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis;Austin Bat Cave in Austin;Fighting Words in Dublin, Ireland, started by Roddy Doyle,this will be open in April.Now I'm going to the TED Wish -- is that okay?All right, I've got a minute. So, the TED Wish:I wish that you -- you personally and every creative individualand organization you know -- will find a wayto directly engage with a public school in your areaand that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved,so that within a year we have a thousand examples --a thousand! -- of transformative partnerships.Profound leaps forward!And these can be things that maybe you're already doing.I know that so many people in this roomare already doing really interesting things.I know that for a fact. So, tell us these stories and inspire others on the website.We created a website.I'm going to switch to "we," and not "I," hope:We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher ina new era of participation in our public schools.We hope that you will take the leadin partnering your innovative spirit and expertisewith that of innovative educators in your community.Always let the teachers lead the way.They will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out.There are a million ways.You can walk up to your local schooland consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help.So, this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco,they did this phenomenal job.This website is already up, it's already got a bunch of stories,a lot of ideas. It's called "Once Upon a School,"which is a great title, I think.This site will document every story, every project that comesout of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website,you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired byand then you add your own projects once you get started.Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So, visit the site.If you have any questions, you can ask this guy,who's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone.You email him, he'll answer any question you possibly want.And he'll get you inspired and get you goingand guide you through the process so that you can affect change.And it can be fun! That's the point of this talk --it needn't be sterile. It needn't be bureaucratically untenable.You can do and use the skills that you have.The schools need you. The teachers need you.Students and parents need you. They need your actual person:your physical personhood and your open mindsand open ears and boundless compassion,sitting next to them, listening and noddingand asking questions for hours at a time.Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are:how smart and how much they have to say.You can tell them. You can shine that light on them,one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us.Thank you so much.

In this rather long sort of marathon presentation,I've tried to break it up into three parts:the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can bea little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computerand really address the qualities of the human interface.And these will be some simple design qualitiesand they will also be some qualities of, if you will,the intelligence of interaction.Then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies --new media falling very much into that mold.Again, I will go through them as fast as possible.And then the last one will be some examplesI've been able to collect, which I thinkillustrate this at least as best I can, in the world of entertainment.People have this belief -- and I share most of it --that we will be using the TV screens or their equivalentsfor electronic books of the future. But then you think,"My God! What a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on TV."Well, it doesn't have to be terrible.And that is a slide taken from a TV setand it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium,and it absolutely looks beautiful.Well, what's happened? How did people get into this mess?Where you are now, all of a sudden,sitting in front of personal computersand video text -- teletext systems,and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen?Well, you have to remember that TV was designedto be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal.So you get a 13-inch, 19-inch, whatever, TV,and then you should multiply that by eightand that's the distance you should sit away from the TV set.Now we've put people 18 inches in front of a TV,and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen,all of a sudden, are staring you in the face:the shadow mask, the scan lines, all of that.And they can be treated very easily;there are actually ways of getting rid of them,there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures.I'm talking here a little bit about display technologies.Let me talk about how you might input information.And my favorite example is always fingers.I'm very interested in touch-sensitive displays.High-tech, high-touch. Isn't that what some of you said?It's certainly a very important medium for input,and a lot of people think that fingers are a very low-resolutionsort of stylus for inputting to a display.In fact, they're not: it's really a very, very high-resolution input medium --you have to just do it twice, you have to touch the screenand then rotate your finger slightly --and you can move a cursor with great accuracy.And so when you see on the market these systemsthat have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution,it's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing.But it, in some sense, misses the point:namely, that fingers are a very, very high-resolution input medium.Now, what are some of the other advantages?Well, the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up,and people don't realize how important that is --not having to pick up your fingers to use them. (Laughter)When you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh --and I will not criticize the mouse too much --when you're typing -- what you have -- you want to now put something --first of all, you've got to find the mouse.You have to probably stop. Maybe not come to a grinding halt,but you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse,and you're going to have to wiggle it a little bitto see where the cursor is on the screen.And then when you finally see where it is,then you've got to move it to get the cursor over there,and then -- "Bang" -- you've got to hit a button or do whatever.That's four separate steps versus typing and then touchingand typing and just doing it all in one motion --or one-and-a-half, depending on how you want to count.Again, what I'm trying to do is just illustratethe kinds of problems that I think face the designersof new computer systems and entertainment systemsand educational systemsfrom the perspective of the quality of that interface.And another advantage, of course, of using fingers is you have 10 of them.And we have never known how to do this technically,so this slide is a fake slide.We never succeeded in using ten fingers,but there are certain things you can do, obviously,with more than one-finger input, which is rather fascinating.What we did stumble across was something ...Again, which is typical of the computer field,is when you have a bug that you can't get rid of you turn it into a feature.And maybe ... (Laughter)maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug.But the bug in our case was in touch-sensitive displays:we wanted to be able to draw -- you know, rub your fingeracross the screen to input continuous points --and there was just too much frictioncreated between your finger and the glass --if glass was the substrate, which it usually is.So we found that that actually was a featurein the sense you could build a pressure-sensitive display.And when you touch it with your finger,you can actually, then, introduce all the forces on the face of that screen,and that actually has a certain amount of value.Let me see if I can load another discand show you, quickly, an example.Now, imagine a screen, which is not only touch-sensitive now,it's pressure-sensitive.And it's pressure-sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen --X, Y, and Z at least in one direction;we couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction.But let me get rid of the slide,and let's see if this comes on.OK. So there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation.The person's just, if you will, pushing on the screen to make a curve.But this is the interesting part.I want to stop it for a secondbecause the movie is very badly made.And the particular display was built about six years ago,and when we moved from one room to another room,a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed.So all we have is this record. (Laughter)But imagine that screen having lots of objects on itand the person has touched an object --one of N -- like he did there, and then pushed on it.Now, imagine a programwhere some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light:one is an anvil on a fuzzy rugand the other one is a ping-pong ball on a sheet of glass.And when you touch it, you have to really push very hardto move that anvil across the screen,and yet you touch the ping-pong ball very lightlyand it just scoots across the screen.And what you can do -- oops, I didn't mean to do that --what you can do is actually feed back to the userthe feeling of the physical properties.So again, they don't have to be weight;they could be a general trying to move troops,and he's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat.In fact, they funded it for that very reason.(Laughter)The whole notion, then, is one that at the interfacethere are physical properties in that transducer --in this case it's pressure and touches --that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before.So it's not simply looking at the quality or, if you will, the luxury of that interface,but it's actually looking at the ideaof presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before.I want to move on to another example,which is one of a different sort, where we're trying to use computerand video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book.Here, the idea is that you're going to take this book,if you will, and it's going to come alive.You're going to sort of breathe life into it.We are so used to doing monologues.Filmmakers, for example, are the experts in monologue making:you make a film and it has a well-formed beginning, middle and end,and in some sense the art of it is that.And you then say, "There's an opportunityfor making conversational movies." Well, what does that mean?And it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole professionand all the assumptions of that medium.So, book writing is the same thing.What I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of bookwhere it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there,but you have to keep a few things in mind.One is that this book knows about itself.Each frame of the movie has information about itself.So it knows, or at least there is computer-readable informationin the medium itself. It's just not a static movie frame.That's one thing. The other is that you have to realizethat it is a random access medium,and you can, in fact, branch and expand and elaborate and shrink.And here -- again, my favorite example -- is the cookbook,the "Larousse Gastronomique."And I think I use the example all too often,but it's a great one because there is a classic ending in that littleencyclopedia-style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin,and you get to the end of the recipe and it says, "Cook until done."Now, that would be, if you will, the top green track,which doesn't mean too much. But you might have to elaborate for meor for somebody who isn't an expert, and say,"Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes."And then for a real beginner, you would go down even furtherand elaborate more -- say, "Open the oven, preheat, wait for the light to go out,open the door, don't leave it open too long,put the penguin in and shut the door ..." (Laughter) whatever.And that's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back.That's one kind of use of random access.And the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways.If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question,the last thing you do is repeat what you just said.You try and think of a different way of saying the same thing,or if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style,then you might say it in a way that you thinkwould have a good impedance match with that student.There are all sorts of techniques you will use --and again, this is a different kind of branching.So, what I will show you is ... it's a rather boring book,but I'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring booksbecause your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fictionand entertainment. And this is a book on how to repair a transmission.Now, I don't even know what vintage the transmission is,but let me just show you very quickly some of it, and we'll move on.(Video) Narrator: And continue to get descriptions for each of these chapters.Nicholas Negroponte: Now, this is his table of contents.Just a picture of the transmission, and as you rub your finger across the transmissionit highlights the various parts.Narrator: When I find a chapter that I want to see,I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read.The words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words,so I can get a different definition by just touching the word,and the definition appears, superimposed over the illustration.NN: This is about the oil pan, or the oil filter and all that.This is relatively important because it sets the page ...Narrator: This is another example of a page with glossary wordshighlighted in red.I can get a definition of these words just by touching them,and the definition will appear in the illustration corner.I can get back to the illustration, but in this case it's not a single frame,but it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repairthat's described in the text.The two-headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movieat various speeds, in forward or reverse.And the movie is displayed as a full frame movie.I can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed.Here's another step-by-step procedure, only in this case --NN: Okay, this movie is ... Everybody's heard of sound-sync movies --this is text-sync movies, so as the movie plays, the text gets highlighted.We highlight the text as we go through the movie.Repairman: ... Not too far out. Front poles, preferably.Don't loosen them too far. If you loosen them too far, you'll have a big mess.NN: I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language.(Laughter)OK. I'm at the third and last part of this,which I said I would make an attempt to at least give you some examplesthat may be more directly related to the world of entertainment.And of course, good education has got to be good entertainment,so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experimentthat we've been doing -- in this case, in Senegal --where we have tried to use personal computersas a pedagogical medium. But not as teaching machines at all;the whole notion is to use this as an instrumentwhere there is a complete reversal of roles --the child is, if you will, the teacher and the machine is the student --and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort ofapproximates thinking about thinking.But teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant.And there are just a few slides I want to go through,but there's a story I'd like to tell. And that was when,before we did this in any developing countries --we're doing it, in fact, in three developing countries right now:Pakistan, Colombia and Senegal --we did it in some pretty rough areas of New York City.And one child, whose name I've forgotten, was about seven or eight years old,absolutely considered mentally handicapped --couldn't read, didn't even make it in the lowest section of the school's classes --and was pretty much not in school, though physically there.But did hang around the, quote, "computer room,"where there were quite a few computers,and learned this particular language called Logo --and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun,it was very interesting. And one day, by chance,some visitors from the NIE came by in their double-breasted suitslooking at this setup, and none of the children who were normally there,except for this one child, were there.He was, and he said, "Let me show you how this works,"and they got an absolutely ingenuous, wonderful description of Logo.And the child was just zipping right through it, showing them all sorts of thingsuntil they asked him how to do something which he couldn't explainand so he flipped through the manual, found the explanationand typed the command and got it to do what they asked.They were delighted, and by the time it was time to go see the principal,whom they'd actually come to see -- not the computer room --they went upstairs and they said,"This is absolutely remarkable!That child was very articulate and showed usand even dealt with the things he couldn't do automaticallywith that manual. It was just absolutely fantastic."The principal said, "There's a dreadful mistake,because that child can't read.And you obviously have been hoodwinkedor you've talked about somebody else."And they all got up and they all went downstairsand the child was still there. And they did something very intelligent:they asked the child, "Can you read?"And the child said, "No, I can't."And then they said, "But wait a minute. Youjust looked through that manual and you found ... "and he said, "Oh, but that's not reading."And so they said, "Well, what's reading then?"He says, "Well, reading is this junk they give me in little books to read.It's absolutely irrelevant, (Laughter) and I get nothing for it.But here, with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return."And it really meant something to the child.The child read beautifully, it turned out,and was really very competent. So it actually meant something.And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar,but wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there,and it is: when does it mean something to a child?There is a myth, and it truly is a myth:we believe -- and I'm sure a lot of you believe in this room --that it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak.And it's not, but we think speech -- "My God, little children pick it up somehow,and by the age of two they're doing a mediocre job,and by three and four they're speaking reasonably well.And yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read,and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you.Hence, it must be harder." Well, it's not harder.What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child;the child can get a great deal by talking to you.Reading and writing is utterly useless.There is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith,and that it's going to help you. (Laughter)So what happens is you go to school and people say,"Just believe me, you're going to like it.You're going to like reading," and just read and read.On the other hand, you give a kid -- a three-year-old kid -- a computerand they type a little command and -- Poof! -- something happens.And all of a sudden ... You may not call that reading and writing,but a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screenhas a huge payoff, and it's a lot of fun.And in fact, it's a powerful educational instrument.Well, in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom:120 kids -- three per desk -- one teacher, a little bit of chalk.This student was one of our first students,and it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard,and she came ... within two days --I want to show you the program she wrote,and remember her hairstyle. And that is the program she made.That's what meant something to her, is doing the hair pattern,and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day --and found it was, to her,absolutely the most meaningful piece ...But rooted in that, little did she know how much knowledgeshe was acquiring about geometryand just math and logic and all the rest.And again, I could talk for three hours about this subject.I will come to my last example and then quit.And my last example -- as some of my former colleagues,whom I see in the room, can imagine what it will be.Yes, it is. It's our work -- that was a while ago,and it still is my favorite project -- of teleconferencing.And the reason it remains a favorite projectis that we were asked to do a teleconferencing systemwhere you had the following situation:you had five people at five different sites -- they were known people --and you had to have these people in teleconference,such that each one was utterly convincedthat the other four were physically present.Now, that is sufficientlyzany that we would, obviously, jump to the bait, and we did.And the fact that we knew the people --we had to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney --we actually went so far as to build CRTsin the shapes of the people's faces.So if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone,my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk,(Laughter)and that would be the TV used for the occasion.And it's uncanny: there's no way I can explain to youthe amount of eye contact you get with that physical faceprojected on a 3D CRT of that sort.The next thing that we had to do is to persuade themthat there needed to be spatial correspondence, which is straightforward,but again, it's something that didn't fall naturallyout of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking;it was a very, if you will, architectural or spatial concept.And that was to recognize that when you sit around the table,the actual location of the people becomes rather important.And when somebody gets up, in fact, to go answer a phoneor use a bathroom or something, the empty seat becomes,if you will, that person. And you point frequently to the empty seatand you say, "He or she wouldn't agree,"and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial.So we said, "Well, these will be on round tablesand the order around the table had to be the same,so that at my site, I would be, if you will, realand then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads.And the plastic heads, sometimes you want to project them.And there are a number of schemes, which I don't want to dwell on,but this is the one that we finally usedwhere we projected onto rear screen materialthat was molded in the face -- literally in the face of the person.And I'll show you one more slide, where this is actually madefrom something called a solid photograph and is the screen.Now, we track, on the person's head, the head motions --so we transmit with a video the head positions --and so this head moves in about two axes.So if I, all of a sudden, turn to the person to my leftand start talking to that person, then at the person to my right's site,he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other.And then if that person interrupts, then those two heads may turn.And it really is reconstructing, quite accurately, teleconferencing.

Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today,but this is really, I think, when it reached its peakas far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;it's something we just kind of learned for this,so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!Nice show. Man, that was good!DH: Thank you.BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.You actually just did that. (Laughter)That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ...DH: All right, let's show them something special.BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ...TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling propshe has invented and working on.Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.DH: A type of juggling I actually invented,right after I saw another juggler do it.BF: Shut up. (Laughter)DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.(Laughter)(Applause)Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopperbut it certainly slows it down.BF: Oh yeah, it does. (Drum roll)BF: Oh, Daniel.(Applause)DH: One more? (Drum roll)Perfect. (Drum roll)Perfect. (Drum roll)BF: OK. DH: Oh! All right.(Applause)I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.In order to do six cups, I must have perfect controlover three with my right hand. (Drum roll)BF: Also three with his left.DH: Perfect.(Laughter)And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first tryor should I miss once on purpose? (Laughter)BF: First try? Once on purpose?(Audience: Once on purpose!)DH: How about if I try first and then decide?BF: Good idea. (Laughter) Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open.(Laughter) (Applause)DH: He's looking at me.BF: That's all right, he does that. All right.DH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help. (Laughter)Oh, good. All right.BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference,it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerouswith Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhipsin our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.And then we thought, "How stupid."DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?BF: I think that's the next session.DH: Next session?BF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.He actually assumes more of the danger in this.DH: Please stand up, Richard. (Whip cracks)Oh, sorry. (Laughter)DH: Now Richard, please ... (Whip cracks)BF: OK, sorry.DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.Richard Wurman: Can I say something?BF: Sure.RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them,the things that have happened to me --I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.DH: All right, please stand here in front ...God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.(Laughter)BF: No, come stay up with him.Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.It's kind of neat. OK.(Laughter)DH: Wow, you've been working out.BF: No, shut up!(Laughter)Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.OK, here we go.Have him hold your wrist so I can ...DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.There you go.(Laughter)OK.OK, hold on.RW: Hmmm.(Laughter)DH: First one.BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.(Laughter)DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?(Laughter)What happened there?BF: I think we were just outside.DH: I don't get it. (Applause)(Laughter)DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks.RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.BF: Here we go, I'm taking it. (Balloon pops) (Applause)DH: One more, one more.BF: We've got one more we're going to do.RW: Do I get to hold them?BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?(Laughter)BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.(Laughter)(Applause)(Laughter)One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close.(Laughter)Could you just push that?(Applause)DH: Wow! Boy!BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that.(Laughter)DH: Let's jump this way, though.Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ...(Laughter)DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.DH: True. Barry ...BF: I'm going to run up behind him.DH: Leap over my shoulder.BF: Up and over his shoulders.DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...(Laughter)Still juggling. (Laughter)Impossible, you say?BF: Incredible, you say?DH: Why bother, you say?BF: Here we go.DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?BF: This guy, this guy invented air.DH: I think so, that's right.Even the pencil.BF: He invented the pencil.DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please rememberit took us over 10 years to perfect.BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much.Actually, we will take a second to prove --this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animalup onto the stage?(Laughter)Or a virgin for a sacrifice?BF: Anything?DH: Where's Gloria?

alison_jackson_looks_at_celebrity
655483

I'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums.I show a number of photographs and films,but I also make television programs, books and some advertising,all with the same concept.And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture,and the importance of the image:celebrity is born of photography.I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago,when Princess Diana died.There was a sort of a standstill in Britainthe moment of her death,and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way.I was fascinated by this phenomenon,so I wondered:could one erase the image of Diana, actually quite crudely and physically?So, I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana,but I couldn't erase this from my memoryand certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche.Momentum was being built.The press wrote about her death in rather, I felt, pornographic ways --like, "Which bit of artery left which bit of body?"and "How did she die in the back of the car?" --and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism,so I made these rather gory images.I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image,so I got a look-alike of Dianaand posed her in the right positions and anglesand created something that was in, or existed in, the public imagination.So people were wondering: was she going to marry Dodi?Was she in love with him?Was she pregnant? Did she want his baby?Was she pregnant when she died?So I created this image of Diana, Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race childand this image came out, which caused a huge public outcry at the time.I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery,so I started making reference to media imagery --made it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth --to titillate the public or the viewer furtherin terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism.So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband,and this was a sequence of images.And this gets shown in art galleries like this, as a sequence.And similarly with the Di-Dodian baby imagery --this is another art gallery installation.I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception.This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance,but you think it's Camilla and the Queen,and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real.And the camera can lie,and it makes it very, very easywith the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths.So, I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces usand is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter.And at the same time, it removes us from the real subject matter,and this acts as a sort of titillating thing.So, the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism;what you can't have, you want more.In the photograph, the real subject doesn't existso it makes you want that person more.And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now:the more pictures you see of these celebrities,the more you feel you know them,but you don't know themand you want to know them further.Of course, the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...watch her horses. (Laughter).And then I was sort of making imagery.In England there's an expression: "you can't imagine the Queen on the loo."So I'm trying to penetrate that.Well, here is the image.All this imagery was creating a lot of fussand I was cited as a disgusting artist. The press were writing about this,giving full pages about how terrible this was.Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle:I was making comments about the pressand about how we know facts and information only by media --because we don't know the real people;very few of us know the real people --but it was going back into the pressand they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work.So, these are broadsheets, tabloids, debates were being had all about this work,films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work,politicians were getting involved --all sorts of things -- great headlines.Then suddenly, it started to get on front pages.I was being asked and paid to do front covers.Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable,which I found also fascinating.How one moment -- it was disgusting --journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me,saying my work was wonderful,and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me.But then this changed suddenly.I then started to work for magazines and newspapers.This was, for example, an image that went into Tatler.This was another newspaper image.It was an April fool actually, and to this day some people think it's real.I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day,and they were saying there's this great image of the Queensitting outside William Hill.They thought it was real.I was exploring, at the time, the hyperbole of icons --and Diana and Marilyn -- and the importance of celebrity in our lives.How they wheedle their way into the collective psychewithout us even knowing,and how that should happen.I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself.There's me as Diana --I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley, I think, in this one. (Laughter).And me as the Queen.I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn --the biggest icon of all --and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth,and only showing certain angles to create a reality that, obviously,is completely constructed.This is the look-alike, so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous.She looks nothing like Marilyn,but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on,she looks exactly like Marilyn,to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her --or recognize this look-alike -- in these photographs,which I find quite interesting.So, all this work is getting shown in art galleries.Then I made a book.I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time.Stills from the TV series went into this book.But there was a real legal problem because it looks real,but how do you get over that?Because obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now:that we can't tell what's real.How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not?So, from my point of view, it's important to publish it,but at the same time it does cause a confusion --intentional on my behalf,but problematic for any outlet that I'm working with.So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do,and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebritiesand comments about our public figures.You know, what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru?And also dealing with the perceptions that are put aboutBin Laden, Saddam Hussein, the links that were put about pre-Iraq war.And what is going to happen to the monarchy?Because obviously the British public,I think, would prefer William to Charles on the throne.And it's that wish, or that desire, that I suppose I'm dealing with in my work.I'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves.I'm interested in the perception of the celebrity.And with some look-alikes, they are so goodyou don't know whether they're real or not.I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes, which is Coca-Cola,and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities.It's highly commercial.But it was a difficulty for me -- because this is my artwork;should I do advertising? -- at the time.So I made sure the work was not compromised in any wayand that the integrity of the work remained the same.But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on,you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a productand that's all you're doing.When you take the logo off, you're opening up the interpretationsand making the work inconclusive,opposed to conclusive when you are advertising.This image is quite interesting, actually,because I think we made it three years ago.And it's Camilla in her wedding dress, which, again,nearly got re-used now, recently prior to her wedding.Tony Blair and Cherie. And again, the legalities -- we had to be very careful.It's obviously a very big commercial company, and so this little,"Shh -- it's not really them,"was put on the side of the imagery.And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail.I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them,so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes --live scenes with look-alikes inside the windows,and the windows were all steamed up.So, it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech;I've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin;Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson, who he was having an affair with at that time.This was a huge success for thembecause the imagery got shown in the press the day afterin every single newspaper, broadsheets and tabloids.It was a bit of a road stopper, which was problematicbecause the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds,but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance.Also, people were taking photographs of this,so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly, all this imagery.And the press were interviewing, and I was signing my book. (Laughter).Further imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschenthat I'm working on really for a sort of global market --my previous book was only for the U.K. market --that I suppose it could be called humorous.I suppose I come from a sort of non-humorous backgroundwith serious intent,and then suddenly my work is funny.And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way;I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imageryand how we read all our information through imagery.It's an extremely fast way of getting information.It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly,and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery.This image, for example, is sort of spot-onbecause it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private,and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein, and George Bushreading the Koran upside-down.For example, George Bush target practice --shooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore.And then you change the photograph he's shooting at,and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible. (Laughter).Tony Blair being used as a mounting block,and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind,and the seriousness, or the intellect, of Bush.And also, commenting on the behind the scenes --well, as we know now -- what goes on in prisons.And in fact, George Bush and Tony Blairare having great fun during all of this.And really commenting, you know,based on the perception we have of the celebrities.What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life,and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rageand golf-clubbed a driver the other day.I mean, it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes,so I'm constantly going up to people in the streetand trying to ask people to comeand be in one of my photographs or films.And sometimes asking the real celebrity,mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person,which is highly embarrassing. (Laughter).I've also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis --a page a week in their newspaper --which has been very interesting, working topically.So, Jamie Oliver and school dinners;Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture;the whole of the hunting issue,and the royal family refusing to stop hunting;and the tsunami issues; and obviously Harry;Blair's views on Gordon Brown, which I find very interesting;Condi and Bush.This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it.I made it a year ago. And just how meanings change,and there were a terrible thing that has happened,but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that.That's why this image was made one year ago,and what it means today.So, I'll leave you with these clips to have a look. (Music)Chris Anderson: Thank you.

(Applause)It's really quite an honor to be here tonight,and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listenedbecause I've really been inspired.And I'm going to play some songs for you tonightthat are, literally, world premieres.I've been working on my new recordand I've never played these songs for anybodyexcept the microphone.This is a song that I wroteabout the meaning of technology,which goes perfectly with this gathering.I started thinking about -- when I was in college,especially as a blind person,doing a research paper was a major undertaking.You had to go to the library,see if you could get them to find the books for you,you know, footnotes and all that.Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up.I wish I had that when I was in college.Anyway, this is a song about:we have all this, but what are we going to do with it?It's called "All the Answers."♫ What is the weather in Cincinnati? ♫♫ What is the time in Tokyo? ♫♫ Who is this little child's daddy? ♫♫ And who the hell needs to know? ♫♫ Why do memories of you linger ♫♫ when I'm trying to reach my goal? ♫♫ And why must I move my fingers ♫♫ to the music in my soul? ♫♫ I don't know. ♫♫ I don't have to know. ♫♫ 'Cause here I go ... ♫♫ and I got all the answers ♫♫ right here in my hand. ♫♫ And I got all the answers ♫♫ and I don't have to understand ♫♫ 'cause I got all the answers. ♫♫ Think I'll rummage through the century ♫♫ while I listen to the sea. ♫♫ Oh, it's good to be so free, ♫♫ so free. ♫♫ Who was mayor of Chicago ♫♫ back in 1964? ♫♫ And why did Shakespeare create Iago ♫♫ to tear apart a love so pure? ♫♫ How can my dreams be so vivid ♫♫ in a psychosonic way? ♫♫ Why must I become so livid ♫♫ about the news I hear today? ♫♫ I don't know. ♫♫ I don't have to know. ♫♫ And here I go ... ♫♫ 'cause I got all the answers ♫♫ right here in my hand. ♫♫ And I got all the answers. ♫♫ See, I don't have to understand ♫♫ 'cause I got all the answers. ♫♫ I think I'll browse on through ♫♫ the tabloid news ♫♫ while I sip my tea. ♫♫ Mm, it's good to be so free. ♫(Trumpet sounds)♫ I never ever have to be alone. ♫♫ I can do it all right here in my home. ♫♫ Yeah, mm-hmm ... ♫♫ Everything that's ever been known, ♫♫ I can punch it up right here on my phone. ♫♫ Freedom train, coming soon ♫♫ right here in my living room ♫♫ from Baton Rouge to Saskatoon ♫♫ and all points in between. ♫♫ 'Cause I got all the answers ♫♫ right here on my screen. ♫♫ And I got all the answers, yeah. ♫♫ I got every book and magazine. ♫♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫♫ I got all the answers, ♫♫ all the answers, oh yeah. ♫♫ Uh-huh ... ♫♫ But I tell you what I'm going to do: ♫♫ I'm going to find the capitol of Peru ♫♫ or the latitude of Kathmandu. ♫♫ I'm gonna Google it ♫♫ 'cause everybody's doing it. ♫♫ And then I'll rummage through the century. ♫♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫♫ I got all the answers. ♫♫ Yeah, yeah ♫♫ I got all the answers. ♫(Applause)Thank you.Whew! It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song.That's the first time I've ever played it.(Applause)It's a "feel the fear and do it anyway" kind of thing.This next song is a songthat started out as a dream -- a childhood dream.It was one of the titlesthat I was sort of thinking about calling my record,except there's a couple of problems.One thing is, it's unpronounceable.And it's a made-up word.It's called "Tembererana."And the song is based onwhat I think was my firstchildhood attemptsto think about invisible forces.So "tembererana" was these dreams,in which I would be running awayfrom bad feelings -- is the only way I can put it.So this is called "Tembererana."It's based on an Argentinian rhythmcalled "carnivalito."♫ A dream within a dream, ♫♫ a world within a world, ♫♫ the sound of a primal scream ♫♫ travels out across the land. ♫♫ Images flickering, ♫♫ the sound of the war machine, ♫♫ a procession of limousines ♫♫ travels slowly across the land. ♫♫ Another child could use a hand. ♫♫ Reaching out from within ♫♫ tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫♫ Annihilation moves. ♫♫ The earth is an open tomb. ♫♫ The sound of the final boom ♫♫ rumbles fiercely across the land. ♫♫ Fear, you're the enemy. ♫♫ Obliterating all but thee. ♫♫ You see what you want to see. ♫♫ Before I'm blinded, I will toast ♫♫ the shade of power that I love most, ♫♫ the power of creation. ♫♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫♫ Da, da, da, da ♫♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫♫ As a child, alone and afraid, ♫♫ escaping the impressions every feeling made, ♫♫ I would run, run away ♫♫ into a world where the good was the aim of the game ♫♫ and the sum of invisible power ♫♫ had a name. ♫♫ It's the same name. ♫♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana ♫♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana, hey ♫♫ Tembererana, hey ♫♫ Tembererana ... ♫(Applause)

I wanna start today -- here's my thing. Hold on. There I go.Hey. I wanna start today -- talk about the structure of a polypeptide. (Laughter)I get a lot of people asking me, in terms of "Lost," you know,"What the hell's that island?" You know,it's usually followed by,"No, seriously, what the hell is that island?"(Laughter)Why so many mysteries? What is it about mystery that I seem to be drawn to?And I was thinking about this, what to talk about at TED.When I talked to the kind rep from TED, and I said,"Listen, you know, what should I talk about?"He said, "Don't worry about it. Just be profound."(Laughter) And I took enormous comfort in that.So thank you, if you're here.I was trying to think, what do I talk about? It's a good question.Why do I do so much stuff that involves mystery? And I started trying to figure it out.And I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do,and I started thinking about my grandfather.I loved my grandfather. Harry Kelvin was his name,my mother's father. He died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.And one of the reasons he was amazing:After World War II he began an electronics company.He started selling surplus parts, kits, to schools and stuff.So he had this incredible curiosity. As a kid I saw himcome over to me with radios and telephones and all sorts of things.And he'd open them up, he'd unscrew them, and reveal the inner workings --which many of us, I'm sure, take for granted.But it's an amazing gift to give a kid.To open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is.He was the ultimate deconstructer, in many ways.And my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart,but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts,like, you know, printing, like the letter press. I'm obsessed with printing.I'm obsessed with silk screening and bookbinding and box making.When I was a kid, I was always, like, taking apart boxes and stuff.And last night in the hotel, I took apart the Kleenex box.I was just looking at it. And I'm telling you ... (Laughter) It's a beautiful thing.I swear to God. I mean, when you look at the box, and you sort of see how it works.Rives is here, and I met him years ago at a book fair; he does pop-up books.And I'm obsessed with, like, engineering of paper.But like, the scoring of it, the printing of it, where the thing gets glued,you know, the registration marks for the ink. I just love boxes.My grandfather was sort of the guy who, you know,kind of got me into all sorts of these things.He would also supply me with tools.He was this amazing encourager -- this patron, sort of, to make stuff.And he got me a Super 8 camera when I was 10 years old.And in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly,to be a 10-year-old kid that had access to a camera.And you know, he was so generous; I couldn't believe it.He wasn't doing it entirely without some manipulation.I mean, I would call him, and I'd be like,"Listen, Grandpa, I really need this camera.You don't understand. This is, like, you know, I want to make movies.I'll get invited to TED one day. This is like -- " (Laughter)And you know, and my grandmother was the greatest.Because she'd be like, you know -- she'd get on the phone.She'd be like, "Harry, it's better than the drugs. He should be doing -- "She was fantastic. (Laughter)So I found myself getting this stuff,thanks to her assist, and suddenly, you know,I had a synthesizer when I was 14 years old -- this kind of stuff.And it let me make things, which, to me, was sort of the dream.He sort of humored my obsession to other things too, like magic.The thing is, we'd go to this magic store in New York City called Lou Tannen's Magic.It was this great magic store. It was a crappy little building in Midtown,but you'd be in the elevator, the elevator would open --there'd be this little, small magic store. You'd be in the magic store.And it was just, it was a magical place.So I got all these sort of magic tricks. Oh, here. I'll show you.This is the kind of thing. So it would be like, you know. Right?Which is good, but now I can't move.Now, I have to do this, the rest of the thing, like this.I'm like, "Oh, wow. Look at my computer over there!" (Laughter)Anyway, so one of the things that I bought at the magic store was this:Tannen's Mystery Magic Box.The premise behind the mystery magic box was the following:15 dollars buys you 50 dollars worth of magic.Which is a savings. (Laughter)Now, I bought this decades ago and I'm not kidding.If you look at this, you'll see it's never been opened.But I've had this forever.Now, I was looking at this, it was in my office, as it always is, on the shelf,and I was thinking, why have I not opened this?And why have I kept it? Because I'm not a pack rat. I don't keep everythingbut for some reason I haven't opened this box.And I felt like there was a key to this, somehow,in talking about something at TED that I haven't discussed before,and bored people elsewhere.So I thought, maybe there's something with this. I started thinking about it.And there was this giant question mark. I love the design, for what it's worth,of this thing. And I started thinking, why haven't I opened it?And I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents something important-- to me. It represents my grandfather.Am I allowed to cry at TED? Because -- no, I'm not going to cry. But -- (Laughter)-- the thing is, that it represents infinite possibility.It represents hope. It represents potential.And what I love about this box,and what I realize I sort of do in whatever it is that I do,is I find myself drawn to infinite possibility, that sense of potential.And I realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination.Now, it's not the most ground-breaking idea,but when I started to think that maybe there are times when mysteryis more important than knowledge, I started getting interested in this.And so I started thinking about "Lost," and the stuff that we do,and I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do!In how -- in the creation of "Lost," Damon Lindelof and I,who created the show with me, we were basically tasked with creating this seriesthat we had very little time to do. We had 11 and a half weeksto write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it, cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.So it was not a lot of time. And that sense of possibility -- what could this thing be?There was no time to develop it.I'm sure you're all familiar with those peoplewho tell you what you can't do and what you should change.And there was no time for that, which is kind of amazing.And so we did this show, and for those of you who, you know, who haven't seen it,or don't know it, I can show you this one little clip from the pilot,just to show you some stuff that we did.Claire: Help! Please help me! Help me! Help me!Jack: Get him out of here! Get him away from the engine! Get him out of here!C: I'm having contractions!J: How many months pregnant are you?C: I'm only eight months.J: And how far apart are they coming?C: I don't know. I think it just happened.Man: Hey! Hey! Hey, get away from --JJA: Now, 10 years ago, if we wanted to do that, we'd have to kill a stuntman.We'd actually -- (Laughter)it would be harder. It would take -- Take 2 would be a bitch.So the amazing thing was, we were able to do this thing.And part of that was the amazing availability of technology,knowing we could do anything. I mean, we could never have done that.We might have been able to write it; we wouldn't have been able to depict itlike we did. And so part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process,technology is, like, mind-blowingly inspiring to me.I realize that that blank page is a magic box, you know?It needs to be filled with something fantastic.I used to have the "Ordinary People" script that I'd flip through.The romance of the script was amazing to me; it would inspire me.I wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind ofspirit and thought and emotion that that script did.You know, I love Apple computers. I'm obsessed.So the Apple computer -- like those -- the PowerBook -- this computer, right,it challenges me. It basically says,what are you going to write worthy of me? (Laughter)I guess I feel this -- I'm compelled.And I often am like, you know, dude, today I'm out. I got nothing. You know? (Laughter)So there's that. In terms of the content of it, you look at stories, you think,well, what are stories but mystery boxes?There's a fundamental question -- in TV, the first act is called the teaser.It's literally the teaser. It's the big question.So you're drawn into it. Then of course,there's another question. And it goes on and on.Look at "Star Wars." You got the droids; they meet the mysterious woman.Who's that? We don't know. Mystery box! You know?Then you meet Luke Skywalker. He gets the Droid, you see the holographic image.You learn, oh, it's a message, you know.She wants to, you know, find Obi Wan Kenobi. He's her only hope.But who the hell's Obi Wan Kenobi? Mystery box!So then you go and he meets Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi.Holy shit! You know -- so it keeps us --(Laughter) -- have you guys not seen that?(Laughter) It's huge! Anyway --So there's this thing with mystery boxes that I started feeling compelled.Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination --the withholding of information. You know,doing that intentionally is much more engaging.Whether it's like the shark in "Jaws"-- if Spielberg's mechanical shark, Bruce, had worked,it would not be remotely as scary; you would have seen it too much.In "Alien", they never really showed the alien: terrifying!Even in a movie, like a romantic comedy, "The Graduate,"they're having that date, remember?And they're in the car, and it's loud, and so they put the top up.They're in there -- you don't hear anything they're saying! You can't hear a word!But it's the most romantic date ever. And you love it because you don't hear it.So to me, there's that.And then, finally, there's this idea -- stretching the sort of paradigm a little bit --but the idea of the mystery box.Meaning, what you think you're getting, then what you're really getting.And it's true in so many movies and stories.And when you look at "E.T.," for example -- "E.T." is this, you know,unbelievable movie about what? It's about an alien who meets a kid, right?Well, it's not. "E.T." is about divorce. "E.T." is about a heartbroken,divorce-crippled family, and ultimately, this kid who can't find his way."Die Hard," right? Crazy, great, fun, action-adventure movie in a building.It's about a guy who's on the verge of divorce.He's showing up to L.A., tail between his legs.There are great scenes -- maybe not the most amazing dramaticscenes in the history of time, but pretty great scenes.There's a half an hour of investment in character before you get to the stuffthat you're, you know, expecting.When you look at a movie like "Jaws,"the scene that you expect -- we have the screen?These are the kind of, you know, scenes that you remember and expect from "Jaws."And she's being eaten; there's a shark.The thing about "Jaws" is, it's really about a guywho is sort of dealing with his place in the world -- with his masculinity,with his family, how he's going to, you know, make it work in this new town.This is one of my favorite scenes ever,and this is a scene that you wouldn't necessarily think of when you think of "Jaws."But it's an amazing scene.Father: C'mere. Give us a kiss.Son: Why?Father: 'Cause I need it.JJA: C'mon. "Why? 'Cause I need it?" Best scene ever, right?Come on! So you think of "Jaws" --so that's the kind of stuff that, like, you know, the investment of character,which is the stuff that really is inside the box, you know?It's why when people do sequels, or rip off movies, you know, of a genre,they're ripping off the wrong thing.You're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster.You gotta rip off -- you know, if you rip something off -- rip off the character.Rip off the stuff that matters. I mean, look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you.Because ultimately, you know, the mystery box is all of us. So there's that.Then the distribution. What's a bigger mystery box than a movie theater?You know? You go to the theater, you're just so excited to see anything.The moment the lights go down is often the best part, you know?And you're full of that amazing --that feeling of excited anticipation.And often, the movie's, like, there and it's going, and then something happensand you go, "Oh--" and then something else, and you're, "Mmm ..."Now, when it's a great movie, you're along for the ride'cause you're willing to give yourself to it.So to me, whether it's that, whether it's a TV, an iPod, computer, cell phone --it's funny, I'm an -- as I said, Apple fanatic -- and one day, about a year or so ago,I was signing on online in the morning to watch Steve Jobs' keynote,'cause I always do. And he came on, he was presenting the video iPod,and what was on the enormous iPod behind him?"Lost"! I had no idea! And I realized, holy shit, it'd come full circle.Like, the inspiration I get from the technology is now using the stuff that I do,inspired by it, to sell technology. I mean, it's nuts! (Laughter)I was gonna show you a couple of other things I'm gonna skip through.I just want to show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything.This is something online; I don't know if you've seen it before.Six years ago they did this. This is an online thing done by guyswho had some visual effects experience. But the point was,that they were doing things that were using these mystery boxes that they had --everyone has now.What I've realized is what my grandfather did for me when I was a kid,everyone has access to now.You don't need to have my grandfather, though you wished you had.But I have to tell you -- this is a guy doing stuff on a Quadra 950 computer-- the resolution's a little bit low --using Infinity software they stopped making 15 years ago.He's doing stuff that looks as amazing as stuff I've seen released from Hollywood.The most incredible sort of mystery, I think, is now the question of what comes next.Because it is now democratized. So now, the creation of media is -- it's everywhere.The stuff that I was lucky and begging for to get when I was a kid is now ubiquitous.And so, there's an amazing sense of opportunity out there.And when I think of the filmmakers who exist out there now who would havebeen silenced, you know -- who have been silenced in the past --it's a very exciting thing.I used to say in classes and lectures and stuff,to someone who wants to write, "Go! Write! Do your thing." It's free,you know, you don't need permission to go write. But now I can say,"Go make your movie!" There's nothing stopping youfrom going out there and getting the technology.You can lease, rent, buy stuff off the shelfthat is either as good, or just as good, as the stuff that's being used by the, you know,quote unquote "legit people."No community is best served when only the elite have control.And I feel like this is an amazing opportunity to see what else is out there.When I did "Mission: Impossible III," we had amazing visual effects stuff.ILM did the effects; it was incredible.And sort of like my dream to be involved.And there are a couple of sequences in the movie,like these couple of moments I'll show you.There's that.Okay, obviously I have an obsession with big crazy explosions.So my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I'm about to show you.And it's a scene in which Tom's character wakes up. He's drowsy. He's crazy-- out of it. And the guy wakes up,and he shoves this gun in his nose and shoots this little capsule into his brainthat he's going to use later to kill him, as bad guys do.Bad Guy: Good morning.JJA: OK, now. When we shot that scene, we were there doing it,the actor who had the gun, an English actor, Eddie Marsan -- sweetheart, great guy-- he kept taking the gun and putting it into Tom's nose, and it was hurting Tom's nose.And I learned this very early on in my career: Don't hurt Tom's nose. (Laughter)There are three things you don't want to do. Number two is: Don't hurt Tom's nose.So Eddie has this gun -- and he's the greatest guy -- he'sthis really sweet English guy. He's like, "Sorry, I don't want to hurt you."I'm like -- you gotta -- we have to make this look good.And I realized that we had to do something 'cause it wasn't working just as it was.And I literally, like, thought back to what I would have done usingthe Super 8 camera that my grandfather got me sitting in that room,and I realized that hand didn't have to be Eddie Marsan's. It could be Tom's.And Tom would know just how hard to push the gun. He wouldn't hurt himself.So we took his hand and we painted it to look a little bit more like Eddie's.We put it in Eddie's sleeve,and so the hand that you see -- I'll show you again,that's not Eddie's hand, that's Tom's.So Tom is playing two roles. (Laughter)And he didn't ask for any more money.So here, here. Watch it again.There he is. He's waking up. He's drowsy, been through a lot.Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand. (Laughter) Anyway.So.(Applause)Thanks.So you don't need the greatest technology to do things that can work in movies.And the mystery box, in honor of my grandfather, stays closed.Thank you. (Applause)

Thank you so much. It's really scary to be hereamong the smartest of the smart.I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.There's a Jewish saying that I love.What is truer than truth? Answer: The story.I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truthabout our common humanity.All stories interest me, and some haunt meuntil I end up writing them.Certain themes keep coming up:justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues,freedom.I'm aware of the mystery around us,so I write about coincidences, premonitions,emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.In the last 20 years I have published a few books,but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006,when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's,and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.(Laughter)Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony,of the opening ceremony,called me and said that I had been selectedto be one of the flag-bearers.I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identitybecause I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadiumwithout a walker.(Laughter)I was told that this was no laughing matter.This would be the first timethat only women would carry the Olympic flag.Five women, representing five continents,and three Olympic gold medal winners.My first question was, naturally,what was I going to wear?(Laughter)A uniform, she said,and asked for my measurements.My measurements.I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak,looking like the Michelin Man.(Laughter)By the middle of February,I found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowdscheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind,can determine the result of a race or a game.However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.It is all about passion.The streets of Turin were covered with red postersannouncing the slogan of the Olympics.Passion lives here. Isn't it always true?Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.That is what I need for my characters in my books:a passionate heart.I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels,who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.People like all of you in this room.Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.(Laughter)They only make good former spouses.(Laughter)(Applause)In the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers:three athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.Also, two women with passionate hearts:Wangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenyawho has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so,she has changed the soil, the weather,in some places in Africa, and of coursethe economic conditions in many villages.And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionatelyagainst child prostitution.When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.She told us of little girls raped by men who believe thathaving sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.And of brothels where children are forced to receive five,15 clients per day,and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.In the green room I received my uniform.It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear,but it was far from the Michelin Man suitthat I had anticipated. Not bad, really.I looked like a refrigerator.(Laughter)But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren,the universal symbol of beauty and passion.Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?I don't know.When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"She replied, "Posture. My back is always straight,and I don't make old people's noises."(Laughter)So, there you have some free advicefrom one of the most beautiful women on earth.No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing,no talking to yourselves, no farting.(Laughter)Well, she didn't say that exactly.(Laughter)At some point around midnight,we were summoned to the wings of the stadium,and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started --by the way, the same music that starts here,the Aida March.Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am,not counting the poofy hair.(Laughter)She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah,holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind(Laughter)-- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm,so that my head was actually under the damn flag.(Laughter)All the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.That was fortunate for me, because in most press photosI appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.(Laughter)A place where most men would love to be.(Laughter)(Applause)The best four minutes of my entire lifewere those in the Olympic stadium.My husband is offended when I say this --although I have explained to him that what we do in privateusually takes less than four minutes --(Laughter)-- so he shouldn't take it personally.I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes,because I don't want to forget themwhen old age destroys my brain cells.I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics --passion.So here's a tale of passion.The year is 1998, the place is a prison campfor Tutsi refugees in Congo.By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the worldare women and girls.We can call this place in Congo a death camp,because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.The protagonists of this storyare a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.She's pregnant and a widow.Soldiers have forced her to watchas her husband was tortured and killed.Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive,and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.Two tiny little boys.She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick,and ties it with her own hair.She names the twins after the camp's commandersto gain their favor, and feeds them with black teabecause her milk cannot sustain them.When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter,she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go,even when they hold a gun to her head.Somehow, the family survives for 16 months,and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heartof a young American man, Sasha Chanoff,who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,where they're now living and thriving.Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate womenlike Rose Mapendo.I don't make them up. There's no need for that.I look around and I see them everywhere.I have worked with women and for women all my life.I know them well.I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world,in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist --although the term had not reached Chile yet,so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.(Laughter)I would soon find out that there was a high price to payfor my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,I was able to deliver two.(Laughter)Once, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties,she said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today,but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the worldwho are still forced into premature marriage,prostitution, forced labor --they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.They have no control over their bodies or their lives.They have no education and no freedom.They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.For most Western young women of today,being called a feminist is an insult.Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure youthat it never stopped me from flirting,and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.(Laughter)Feminism is not dead, by no means.It has evolved. If you don't like the term,change it, for Goddess' sake.Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want;the name doesn't matter,as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.The year is 2005.Jenny is a young American dental hygienistwho has gone to the clinic as a volunteerduring her three-week vacation.She's prepared to clean teeth,but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors,no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.Outside, there is a line of womenwho have waited several hours to be treated.The first patient is in excruciating painbecause she has several rotten molars.Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.She risks a lot and she's terrified.She doesn't even have the proper instruments,but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic,her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.The woman's face looks like a watermelon.It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.The husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.Jenny is horrified at what she has done,but then the translator explainsthat the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not homein time to prepare dinner for him.Millions of women live like this today.They are the poorest of the poor.Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor,they own less than one percent of the world's assets.They are paid less than men for the same workif they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerablebecause they have no economic independence,and they are constantly threatened by exploitation,violence and abuse.It is a fact that giving women education, work,the ability to control their own income,inherit and own property, benefits the society.If a woman is empowered,her children and her family will be better off.If families prosper, the village prospers,and eventually so does the whole country.Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.She talks with the women and explains that the land is barrenbecause they have cut and sold the trees.She gets the women to plant new trees and water them,drop by drop.In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest,the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.The poorest and most backward societiesare always those that put women down.Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governmentsand also by philanthropy.For every dollar given to a women's program,20 dollars are given to men's programs.Women are 51 percent of humankind.Empowering them will change everything --more than technology and design and entertainment.I can promise you that women working together --linked, informed and educated --can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,mainly women and children. They are collateral damage.Men run the world, and look at the mess we have.What kind of world do we want?This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?We want a world where life is preservedand the quality of life is enriched for everybody,not only for the privileged.In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintingsat the UC Berkeley library.No museum or gallery in the United States,except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work,has dared to show the paintings because the themeis the Abu Ghraib prison.They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power,in the voluminous Botero style.I have not been able to get those images out of my mindor my heart.What I fear most is power with impunity.I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.In our species, the alpha males define reality,and force the rest of the pack to accept that realityand follow the rules.The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,and in this case, the trickle-down effect,which does not work in economics, works perfectly.Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse --a woman or a child.I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the manythrough gender, income, race, and class.I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changesin our civilization.But for real change, we need feminine energyin the management of the world.We need a critical number of women in positions of power,and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.(Laughter)Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legsand legendary breasts.But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior heartsof Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.I want to make this world good.Not better, but to make it good.Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room --all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleevesand get to work, passionately,in creating an almost perfect world.Thank you.

I don't have children.I borrow my friends' children, so --(Laughter)take all this advice with a grain of salt.I'm Gever Tulley.So we build a lot of things,(Laughter)You know, we live in a worldchild safety regulations can get.manufactured in the United States,We put warnings on coffee cupsto tell us that the contents may be hot.for children under the age of 10.So where does this trend stop?every pokey bit in the world,or not made out of round plastic,they'll hurt themselves with it.grow ever smaller,kids are always going to figure outin whatever environment they can.(Laughter)So despite the provocative title,this presentation is really about safety,to raise our kids to be creative,And what I now present to youis an excerpt from a book in progress.The book is called "50 Dangerous Things."This is "Five Dangerous Things."Thing number one: Play with fire.Whether we remember it or not,it's the first time we really get controlof one of these mysterious things.These mysteries are only revealedSo, playing with fire.about intake, combustion, exhaust.they're going to learn things(Laughter)Number two: Own a pocketknife.which I think is a terrible thing.(Laughter)that you're given.You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar,it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.And it's a powerful and empowering tool.and it left a lasting impression,to see babies playing with knives.through a tool at a very young age.And yeah, they're going to cut themselves.(Laughter)Number three: Throw a spear.they tend to atrophy over time.But when you exercise them,and that applies to your brain, too.the frontal and parietal lobes,and structural problem solving,attention and concentration skills,so those are great.Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances.don't throw it out.Take it apart with your kid,Even if you don't know what the parts are,puzzling out what they might be foris a really good practice for the kidsand no matter how complex they are,they can understand parts of them.and you can understand them.Number five: Two-parter.(Laughter)There are laws beyond safety regulationsIt's a very simple exercise:Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD,You've just broken a law.and that laws have to be interpreted.And also when we go out and drive a car.so this is the alternate --(Laughter)you can drive a car with your child.This is a great stage for a kid.This happens about the same timethese big things in the outside world,that they're trying to get a grip on.And it's perfectly legal.It's very safe actually.And it's fun for the whole family.(Laughter)

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.to do something I call "mathemagics."By any chance, did anyone happenRaise your hand. Did your hand go up?I see, I see one way in the back.You sir, that's three.And anybody on this side here?OK, over there on the aisle.then join me up on stage.Let's give them a nice round of applause.(Applause)That's right.How about a two-digit number?Audience: 22.AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir?Audience: 47.or the calculators are not working.Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034?Volunteer: No.(Applause)OK, great.What I'm going to try and do then --That's OK.For instance, five squared would be?Audience: 25.let me demonstrate with this one --is by taking the number, such as five,hitting "times" and then "equals,"On some of these ancient RPN calculators,you've got an "x squared" button on it,four two-digit numberseven using the shortcut method.What I'll use is the second row this time,and I'll get four of youto each yell out a two-digit number,and if you would square the first number,I will try and race you to the answer. OK?So quickly, a two-digit number please.Audience: 37.Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK.Audience: 23.AB: 23 squared, OK.Audience: 59.AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally?Audience: 93.AB: 93 squared.Would you call out your answers, please?Volunteer: 8649.AB: Thank you very much.(Applause)Let me try to take this one step further.I won't even write these down --Anyone on our panel, verify the answer.Just give some indication if it's right.A three-digit number, sir, yes?Audience: 987.AB: 987 squared is 974,169.(Laughter)AB: Yes? Good.Another three-digit --(Applause)-- another three-digit number, sir?Audience: 457.AB: 457 squared is 205,849.205,849?AB: Yes?Audience: 321.AB: 321 is 103,041.103,041.Yes? One more three-digit number please.Audience: Oh, 722.AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one.Is that 513,284?Volunteer: Yes.Audience: 162.162 squared is 26,244.Volunteer: Yes.Thank you very much.(Applause)(Applause ends)Let me try to take this one step further.(Laughter)You can all take your time on this;but I will try to get the answer right.let's say, one, two, three, four.Nine.Seven.Five.Eight.95 million --(Sighs)218,564?Volunteer: Yes!AB: Thank you very much.(Applause)(Applause ends)and I can --(Laughter)what's that?Does yours go higher?Volunteer: I don't know.AB: Oh, yours does?In the meanwhile, let me concludeAnd instead of squaring it this time,by any three-digit number that you want,So you should have as an answer eitherHow many digits do you have, six or seven?Seven, and yours?Seven? Seven?And, uncertain.Seven.what seven-digit numbers you have?Say "No."(Laughter)or at least the improbable.in any order you'd like.(Laughter)One digit at a time,Starting with your seven-digit number,call out any six of them please.Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2.AB: Did you leave out the number 6?Good, OK, that's one.Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5.did you leave out the number 6?Same as she did, OK.You've got a seven-digit number --call out any six of them loud and clear.Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4.I think you left out the number 3?AB: That's three.OK, any six of them.(Laughter)Really scramble them up this time, please.Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2.Did you leave out the number 7?Thank you very much.(Applause)(Applause ends)For my next number --(Laughter)while I mentally recharge my batteries,I have one more question for the audience.What year was it, first of all?That's why I pick a gentleman first.Audience: 1953.1953, and the month?November what?23rd -- was that a Monday?Audience: Yes.Good. Somebody else?I haven't seen any women's hands up.OK, how about you, what year?1949, and the month?October what?Fifth -- was that a Wednesday?Yell it out, what year?Audience: 1959.1959, OK -- and the month?Audience: February.February what?Good, how about the person behind her?Call out, what year was it?Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday?(Applause)We can do it that way.so I come prepared for that.I brought with me a book of calendars.(Laughter)(Laughter)This is a book of calendars.Who wanted to know their birth day?What year was it, first of all?Audience: 1966.66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.And what month?Audience: 17th.I believe that was a Sunday.Can you confirm, Chris?Chris Anderson: Yes.AB: I'll tell you what, Chris:AB: 1824, OK.AB: And what month?CA: June.AB: Was that a Sunday?(Laughter)Good, thank you very much.(Applause)(Applause ends)But I'd like to wrap things up nowWhere is he, would you stand up,10-digit guy?OK, stand up for me just for a second,so I can see where you are.So you can actually, honestly hearbut I'm not too afraidI think we're OK.(Laughter)(Applause)So, let's see,Oh, I did this row already.Let's do the row before you,Call out a single digit --Five.Seven.Six.Eight.Three.57,683 --squared.Yuck.I'll do 57,000 squared,plus 683 squared,plus 57,000 times 683 times two.Add all those numbers together,and with any luck, arrive at the answer.Now, let me recap.(Laughter)Thank you.(Laughter)While I explain something else --(Laughter)-- I know, that you can use, right?(Laughter)While I do these calculations,you might hear certain words,Let me explain what that is.This is a phonetic code,a mnemonic device that I use,I know it sounds complicated; it's not.(Laughter)definitely, definitely.Sorry.(Laughter)you can talk to me then.By the way, one last instruction,for my judges with the calculators --you know who you are --and I'll try and figure out the answer --If, however, I am right,(Laughter)because this is my big finish, OK.So, without any more stalling,here we go.57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876,that's 38,760 plus 171,38,760 plus 171 is 38,931.38,931; double that to get 77,862.77,862 becomes cookie fission,cookie fission is 77,822.three billion.Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249,oops, but I see a carry coming --249 --add that to cookie, 250 plus 77,is 327 million --that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squaredis 466,489, rev up if I need it,rev up, take the 466,add that to fission, to get,oh gee --328,489.Thank you very much.(Applause)I hope you enjoyed mathemagics.Thank you.(Applause)



larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strangling_creativity
1838092

(Applause)I want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content.I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argumentthat's going to tell you a little bitabout how we open user-generated content up for business.So, here's the first story.1906. This man, John Philip Sousa, traveled to this place,the United States Capitol, to talk about this technology,what he called the, quote, "talking machines."Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines.This is what he had to say."These talking machines are going to ruin artistic developmentof music in this country.When I was a boy, in front of every house in the summer evenings,you would find young people togethersinging the songs of the day, or the old songs.Today, you hear these infernal machines going night and day.We will not have a vocal chord left," Sousa said."The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolutionas was the tail of man when he came from the ape."Now, this is the picture I want you to focus on.This is a picture of culture.We could describe it using modern computer terminologyas a kind of read-write culture.It's a culture where people participate in the creationand the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacitybecause of these, quote, "infernal machines." They would take it away.And in its place, we'd have the opposite of read-write culture,what we could call read-only culture.Culture where creativity was consumedbut the consumer is not a creator.A culture which is top-down, owned,where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost.Now, as you look back at the twentieth century,at least in what we think of as the, quote, "developed world" --hard not to conclude that Sousa was right.Never before in the history of human culturehad it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.Never before has creativity of the millionsbeen as effectively displaced,and displaced because of these, quote, "infernal machines."The twentieth century was that centurywhere, at least for those places we know the best,culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence.So, second. Land is a kind of property --it is property. It's protected by law.As Lord Blackstone described it, land is protected by trespass law,for most of the history of trespass law,by presuming it protects the land all the way down belowand to an indefinite extent upward.Now, that was a pretty good systemfor most of the history of the regulation of land,until this technology came along, and people began to wonder,were these instruments trespassersas they flew over land without clearing the rightsof the farms below as they traveled across the country?Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question.Two farmers, Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby, who raised chickens,had a significant complaint because of these technologies.The complaint was that theirchickens followed the pattern of the airplanesand flew themselves into the walls of the barnwhen the airplanes flew over the land.And so they appealed to Lord Blackstoneto say these airplanes were trespassing.Since time immemorial, the law had said,you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner,so this flight must stop.Well, the Supreme Court considered this 100-years traditionand said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas,that the Causbys must lose.The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting landall the way to the sky has no place in the modern world,otherwise every transcontinental flight wouldsubject the operator to countless trespass suits.Common sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was. Common sense --(Laughter) --Revolts at the idea. Common sense.Finally. Before the Internet, the last great terrorto rain down on the content industrywas a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting:a new way to spread content,and therefore a new battle over the controlof the businesses that would spread content.Now, at that time, the entity,the legal cartel, that controlled the performance rightsfor most of the music that would be broadcastusing these technologies was ASCAP.They had an exclusive license on the most popular content,and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrateto the broadcasters who really was in charge.So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent,until the broadcasters finally got togetherand said, okay, enough of this.And in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started somethingcalled Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.And BMI was much more democratic in the artthat it would include within its repertoire,including African American music for the first time in the repertoire.But most important was that BMI took public domain worksand made arrangements of them, which they gave away for freeto their subscribers. So that in 1940,when ASCAP threatened to double their rates,the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI.Now, ASCAP said they didn't care.The people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best musicwas no longer available, because they had shiftedto the second best public domain provided by BMI.Well, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked.And the important point to recognizeis that even though these broadcasterswere broadcasting something you would call second best,that competition was enough to break, at that time,this legal cartel over access to music.Okay. Three stories. Here's the argument.In my view, the most significant thing to recognizeabout what this Internet is doingis its opportunity to revive the read-write culturethat Sousa romanticized.Digital technology is the opportunityfor the revival of these vocal chordsthat he spoke so passionately to Congress about.User-generated content, spreading in businessesin extraordinarily valuable ways like these,celebrating amateur culture.By which I don't mean amateurish culture,I mean culture where people producefor the love of what they're doing and not for the money.I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time.For when you think of what Sousa romanticizedin the young people together, singing the songs of the day,of the old songs, you should recognizewhat your kids are doing right now.Taking the songs of the day and the old songsand remixing them to make them something different.It's how they understand access to this culture.So, let's have some very few examplesto get a sense of what I'm talking about here.Here's something called Anime Music Video, first example,taking anime captured from televisionre-edited to music tracks.(Music)This one you should be -- confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry.(Music)(Laughter)And this is the best.(Music)My love ...There's only you in my life ...The only thing that's bright ...My first love ...You're every breath that I take ...You're every step I make ...And I ....I want to share all my love with you ...No one else will do ...And your eyes ...They tell me how much you care ...(Music)So, this is remix, right?(Applause)And it's important to emphasize that what this is notis not what we call, quote, "piracy."I'm not talking about nor justifyingpeople taking other people's content in wholesaleand distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner.I'm talking about people taking and recreatingusing other people's content, using digital technologiesto say things differently.Now, the importance of thisis not the technique that you've seen here.Because, of course, every technique that you've seen hereis something that television and film producershave been able to do for the last 50 years.The importance is that that technique has been democratized.It is now anybody with access to a $1,500 computerwho can take sounds and images from the culture around usand use it to say things differently.These tools of creativity have become tools of speech.It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak.It is how our kids think. It is what your kids areas they increasingly understand digital technologiesand their relationship to themselves.Now, in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies,the law has not greeted this Sousa revivalwith very much common sense.Instead, the architecture of copyright lawand the architecture of digital technologies,as they interact, have produced the presumptionthat these activities are illegal.Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies,then in the digital world the one fact we can't escapeis that every single use of culture produces a copy.Every single use therefore requires permission;without permission, you are a trespasser.You're a trespasser with about as much senseas these people were trespassers.Common sense here, though, has not yet revoltedin response to this response that the law has offeredto these forms of creativity.Instead, what we've seenis something much worse than a revolt.There's a growing extremism that comes from both sidesin this debate, in response to this conflictbetween the law and the use of these technologies.One side builds new technologies, such as one recently announcedthat will enable themto automatically take down from sites like YouTubeany content that has any copyrighted content in it,whether or not there's a judgment of fair usethat might be applied to the use of that content.And on the other side, among our kids,there's a growing copyright abolitionism,a generation that rejects the very notionof what copyright is supposed to do, rejects copyrightand believes that the law is nothing more than an assto be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible.The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other,a fact we should have learned many, many times over,and both extremes in this debate are just wrong.Now, the balance that I try to fight for,I, as any good liberal, try to fight for firstby looking to the government. Total mistake, right?(Laughter)Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get themto do something to make the system make more sense.It failed partly because the courts are too passive,partly because the legislatures are corrupted,by which I don't mean that there's briberyoperating to stop real change,but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functionsmeans that policymakers here will not understand thisuntil it's too late to fix it.So, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution.And the solution here, in my view, is a private solution,a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again,and to realize the economic potential of that,and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant.Because, as BMI demonstrated, competition herecan achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now.We don't have a public domain to draw upon now,so instead what we need is two types of changes.First, that artists and creators embrace the idea,choose that their work be made available more freely.So, for example, they can say their work is available freelyfor non-commercial, this amateur-type of use,but not freely for any commercial use.And second, we need the businessesthat are building out this read-write cultureto embrace this opportunity expressly, to enable it,so that this ecology of free content, or freer content,can grow on a neutral platformwhere they both exist simultaneously,so that more-free can compete with less-free,and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competitioncan teach one the lessons of the other.Now, I would talk about one particular such planthat I know something about,but I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling,so I'm not going to talk about this at all.I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us.That artist choice is the key for new technologyhaving an opportunity to be open for business,and we need to build artist choice hereif these new technologies are to have that opportunity.But let me end with something I think much more important --much more important than business.It's the point about how this connects to our kids.We have to recognize they're different from us. This is us, right?(Laughter)We made mixed tapes; they remix music.We watched TV; they make TV.It is technology that has made them different,and as we see what this technology can do,we need to recognize you can't killthe instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it.We can't stop our kids from using it.We can only drive it underground.We can't make our kids passive again.We can only make them, quote, "pirates." And is that good?We live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions,where in many areas of our life,we live life constantly against the law.Ordinary people live life against the law,and that's what I -- we are doing to our kids.They live life knowing they live it against the law.That realization is extraordinarily corrosive,extraordinarily corrupting.And in a democracy, we ought to be able to do better.Do better, at least for them, if not for opening for business.Thank you very much.(Applause)

What I am always thinking aboutis what this session is about, which is called simplicity.And almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded,but in the best sense of the word.I'm trying to figure out two very simple things:how to live and how to die, period.That's all I'm trying to do, all day long.And I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks,and, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal thingsthat keep you grounded.So, I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child.My older sister was busy torturing my parents,and they were busy torturing her.I was lucky enough to be completely ignored,which is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.So, I was able to completely daydream my way through my life.And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967,where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.And feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretchedfrom beginning to end.But I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn't blow up the math building,but he went to Cuba.But I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdaleso I had more money than he did.(Laughter)And that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause.But, then he came back, and things happened,and I decided I really hated my writing,that it was awful, awful, purple prose.And I decided that I wanted to tell --but I still wanted to tell a narrative storyand I still wanted to tell my stories.So I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be?And so what happened was that I startedjust becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know,sheer whatever, sheer ignorance.And we started a studio.Well, Tibor really started the studio, called M&amp;Co.And the premise of M&amp;Co was, we don't know anything,but that's all right, we're going to do it anyway.And as a matter of fact, it's better not to know anything,because if you know too much, you're stymied.So, the premise in the studio was,there are no boundaries, there is no fear.And I -- and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth,was to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideasthat -- fortunately, there were enough people there,and it was a team, it was a collective,it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas.But the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.And so some of the things -- I mean, it was a long history of M&amp;Co,and clearly we also needed to make some money,so we decided we would create a series of products.And some of the watches there,attempting to be beautiful and humorous --maybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding.That to be able to talk about content,to break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise,elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us.It was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in designand we wanted to say, the content is what's important,not the package, not the wrapping.You really have to be journalists, you have to be inventors,you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything.So, the good news is that I have a dogand, though I don't know if I believe in luck --I don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question,but I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times.So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house,because everybody's always, you know, leaving,they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail,and he runs to the other room.But I am able to make the transition from working for children and --from working for adults to children, and back and forth,because, you know, I can say that I'm immature,and in a way, that's true.I don't really -- I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand,I'm not proud of it, but I didn't understandlet's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawingsand I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann's talk.And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk.So, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension --(Laughter)-- which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work.So, I'm open to the possibilities of not knowingand finding out something new.So, in writing for children, it seems simple, and it is.You have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually.And what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say.And hopefully, you're not talking down to kidsand you're not talking in such a way that you,you know, couldn't stand reading it after one time.So, I hopefully am writing, you know,books that are good for children and for adults.But the painting reflects --I don't think differently for children than I do for adults.I try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy,the same kind of love of language.So, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends.This is Andrew Gatz, and he walked in through the door and I said,"You! Sit down there." You know, I take lots of photos.And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair.So, I get to put in all of the things that I love.Hopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels,and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve.And the books are really journals of my life.I never -- I don't like plots.I don't know what a plot means.I can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning,you know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me,because my life is too random and too confused,and I enjoy it that way.But anyway, so we were in Venice,and this is our room. And I had this dreamthat I was wearing this fantastic green gown,and I was looking out the window,and it was really a beautiful thing.And so, I was able to put that into this story, which is an alphabet,and hopefully go on to something else.The letter C had other things in it.I was fortunate also, to meet the man who's sitting on the bed,though I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair.Well, he has some hair but -- well, he used to have hair.And with him, I was able to do a project that was really fantastic.I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happenedand it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx,and somebody said Bronxistan,and somebody said Ferreristan,and we came up with this New Yorker cover,which we were able to -- we didn't know what we were doing.We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be --well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.We hoped we'd be funny, but we didn't know it would be a cover,and we didn't know that that image, at the moment that it happened,would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.And it really became the -- I don't know, you know,it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on.And from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know,for the Fashtoonks, Botoxia, Pashmina, Khlintunisia, you know,we were able to take the cityand make fun of this completely foreign, who are -- what's going on over here?Who are these people? What are these tribes?And David Remnick, who was really wonderful about it,had one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers,because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's.But you know, we said, "David, who's going to know?They're not."(Laughter)So it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing.You know, in the course of my life, I never know what's going to happenand that's kind of the beauty part.And we were on Cape Cod, a place, obviously, of great inspiration,and I picked up this book, "The Elements of Style," at a yard sale.And I didn't -- and I'd never used it in school,because I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out,and I don't know what, sitting in cafes.But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.I said, people should know about this book.(Laughter)So I decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.And basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate,and what an intersection of like, you know,Polish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying,I'd like to do something to this book.And they said yes, and they left me completely alone,which was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.And I took the examples that they gave,and just did 56 paintings, basically.So, this is, I don't know if you can read this."Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."And when you're dealing with grammar,which is, you know, incredibly dry,E.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical -- and actually, Strunk --and then you come to the rules and, you know,there are lots of grammar things. "Do you mind me asking a question?Do you mind my asking a question?""Would, could, should, or would, should, could."And "would" is Coco Chanel's lover, "should" is Edith Sitwell,and "could" is an August Sander subject.And, "He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug."(Laughter)So, there's a kind of British understatement, murder-mystery themethat I really love very much.And then, "Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand."E.B. White wrote us a number of rules,which can either paralyze you and make you loathe himfor the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do,or you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich.So, what I did when I was painting was I started singing,because I really adore singing,and I think that music is the highest form of all art.So, I commissioned a wonderful composer, Nico Muhly,who wrote nine songs using the text,and we performed this fantastic evening of --he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.I played the clattering teacup and the slinkyin the main reading room of the New York Public Library,where you're supposed to be very, very quiet,and it was a phenomenally wonderful event,which we hopefully will do some more.Who knows? The New York TimesSelect, the op-ed page,asked me to do a column, and they said, you can do whatever you want.So, once a month for the last year,I've been doing a column called "The Principles of Uncertainty,"which, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is,but I know I can throw that around now. You know,it's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know.I'm going to read quickly -- and probably I'm going to edit some,because I don't have that much time left -- a few of the columns.And basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing,because I said, "Well, how much space do I have?"And they said, "Well, you know, it's the Internet."And I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?"And they said, "It's unlimited, it's unlimited."OK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I'll begin."How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?Impossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo."And I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct,and then I talk about Spinoza."As the last dodo was dying, Spinoza was looking for a rational explanationfor everything, called eudaemonia.And then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him,and I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal."I happen to know it for a fact.And then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct.And then, we don't have a stuffed Spinoza,but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog,and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia.And there he is, with this horrible electrical box on his rumpin this fantastic, decrepit palace."And I think it must have been a very, very dark daywhen the Bolsheviks arrived.Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs,but Stalin was a paranoid man, even more than my father."(Laughter)You don't even know."And decided his top people had to be extinctified."Which I think I made up, which is a good thing.And so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart,because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed.So, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away."Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov,sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair,leafing through a book and butterflies,imagine such displacement, such loss?"And then I want to tell you that this is a map.So, "My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well.Too many pogroms.Leaving the shack, the wild blueberry woods, the geese, the River Sluch,they went to Palestine and then America."And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America,and that is my DNA over here, because that person who I grew up withhad no use for facts whatsoever.Facts were actually banished from our home.And so, if you see that Texas -- you know, Texas and Californiaare under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina,this is the home that I grew up in, OK?So, it's a miracle that I'm here today.But actually, it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing.But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin,which is the town they came from, and, "Sorry, the rest unknown, thank you."But in her lexicon, "sorry, the rest unknown, thank you" is"sorry, the rest unknown, go to hell,"because she couldn't care less.(Laughter)"The Impossibility of February"is that February's a really wretched month in New Yorkand the images for me conjure up these really awful things.Well, not so awful.I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaperand there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead.And I say, "I hope he's not really dead,just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow,but the caption says he is dead."And actually, he was. I think he's dead, though I don't know,maybe he's not dead."And this woman leans over in anguish, not about that man,but about all sad things. It happens quite often in February."There's consoling.This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase,and basically -- you know, I guess onions are a theme here.And he says, "It is impossible not to lie.It is February and not lying is impossible."And I really spend a lot of time wondering,how much truth do we tell?What is it that we're actually -- what story are we actually telling?How do we know when we are ourselves?How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouthsare real stories, you know, are real sentences?Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying?I'm going to quickly go through this.A quote by Bertrand Russell,"All the labor of all the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration,all the noonday brightness of human geniusare destined to extinction.So now, my friends, if that is true,and it is true, what is the point?"A complicated question.And so, you know, I talk to my friendsand I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs.Oh my God, you know what?Could we have -- no, we don't have time.I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the --you know, could we have it for a second?Do you have that?(Music)OK. I taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the oceanevery day of the year until she was about 85.So -- and that's a song about how everybody's miserablebecause, you know, we're from Russia.(Laughter)I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart, and she is 96,and when I brought her a copy of "The Elements of Style,"she said she would treasure it.And then I said -- oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said,"When you met him, you knew it was him."And she said, "I knew it was he."(Laughter)So, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.And she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.Gershwin died at the age of 38.He's buried in the same cemetery as my husband.I don't want to talk about that now.I do want to talk -- the absolute icing on this cemetery cakeis the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate.(Laughter)And I would like to run it for them.And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise,who's also still working, and I looked at her sink,which is really amazing, and left.And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.And then I go and have some tea.And then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died,she tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel.(Laughter)And I wonder what the point is and then I know, and I seethat Hy Meyerowitz, Rick Meyerowitz's father,a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx,won the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.That's actually Hy.And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit,and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.And it says, "Ich habe genug," which is a Bach cantata,which I once thought meant "I've had it, I can't take it anymore,give me a break," but I was wrong.It means "I have enough." And that is utterly true.I happen to be alive, end of discussion. Thank you.(Applause)

Chris Anderson: Welcome to TED.Richard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great.CA: Have you met anyone interesting?RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn,because I had an apology to make to her.I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd --she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.And I went home to my wife that nightand she wanted to know why I had another woman's big,massive, big wedding ring on my finger.And, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jewelerand get it cut off.So -- (Laughter) --so apologies to Goldie.CA: That's pretty good.So, we're going to put up some slidesof some of your companies here.You've started one or two in your time.So, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records --I guess it all started with a magazine called Student.And then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this?RB: I read all these sort of TED instructions:you must not talk about your own business, and this,and now you ask me.So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage,since you asked the question.(Laughter)CA: It depends what the answer is though.RB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company,you can really run any companies.I mean, companies are all about finding the right people,inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people.And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitiveand I love taking on, you know, the status quoand trying to turn it upside down.So I've seen life as one long learning process.And if I see -- you know, if I fly on somebody else's airlineand find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't,21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can createthe kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.And so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go.CA: Well, that was a bizarre thing,because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who,at the time when you basically sold Virgin Recordsand invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic,and his view was that you were trading, you know,the world's fourth biggest record companyfor the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.Why did you do that?RB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure.And I think if you start a business without financial backing,you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways.They were trying to put our airline out of business,and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign.And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing downunless I chipped in a chip.And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline,and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company,I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline.CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually,for that as well.RB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.But, yeah, it was sad at the time, but we moved on.CA: Now, you use the Virgin brand a lotand it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other.What does the brand stand for in your head?RB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality,that you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they --CA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit?RB: No, but I was going to move on this.We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it.As I say, we go in and shake up other industries,and I think, you know, we do it differentlyand I think that industries are not quite the sameas a result of Virgin attacking the market.CA: I mean, there are a few launches you've donewhere the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.I mean, Virgin Brides -- what happened there?(Laughter)RB: We couldn't find any customers.(Laughter)(Applause)CA: I was actually also curious why --I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.I mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well?Ain't virgin no longer, or something.RB: Again, we may have had problems finding customers.I mean, we had -- often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints,you know, you can deal with them.But about three months after the launch of the condom company,I had a letter, a complaint,and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely.But obviously, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.And then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken,I got this delightful letter with a picture of the babyasking if I'd be godfather, which I became.So, it all worked out well.CA: Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful.RB: I should have.CA: So, just help us with some of the numbers.I mean, what are the numbers on this?I mean, how big is the group overall?How much -- what's the total revenue?RB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total.CA: And how many employees?RB: About 55,000.CA: So, you've been photographed in various ways at various timesand never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that.What was that? Was that real?RB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.No, I mean, I think --CA: But is that your hair?RB: No.CA: What was that one?RB: Dropping in for tea.CA: OK.(Laughter)RB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which --CA: Oh, that car that we -- actually we --it was a TEDster event there, I think.Is that -- could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute?(Laughter)RB: It's a tough job, isn't it?CA: I mean, it is a tough job.(Laughter)When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as welland they kind of -- they have these different rules over here,it's very strange.RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but --CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about --RB: "Pammy" we launched, you know --mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola,and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy"and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.But the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but --(Laughter)CA: Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps?RB: Of course.CA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice.And, OK, so stop there. This was -- you had some award I think?RB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols'"God Save The Queen," and I'd certainly never expectedthat 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us.But somehow, she must have had a forgetful memory, I think.CA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how?RB: Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard.Occasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richardand think there's some Shakespearean play taking place.But nowhere else anyway.CA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...RB: No. I suppose if you're having problemsgetting a booking in a restaurant or something,that might be worth using it.CA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson.RB: I'll go get the secretary to use it.CA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to,and Virgin Galactic up in the air. (Video)So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?RB: Yeah, it'll be ready in -- well, ready in 12 monthsand then we do 12 months extensive testing.And then 24 months from now,people will be able to take a ride into space.CA: So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed?RB: Philippe has done the -- yeah, quite a bit of it:the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico.And basically, he's just taken an eyeand the space station will be one giant eye,so when you're in space,you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you.And when you land, you'll be able to go back into this giant eye.But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design.CA: But you didn't have him design the engine?RB: Philippe is quite erratic,so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no.CA: He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago.RB: Yeah? No, he is a --CA: Well, some people found it wonderful,some people found it completely bizarre.But, I personally found it wonderful.RB: He's a wonderful enthusiast, which is why I love him. But ...CA: So, now, you've always had this exploration bug in you.Have you ever regretted that?RB: Many times.I mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past.Well, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so --and each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale.So in those moments,you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or --CA: What was the closest you got to --when did you think, this is it, I might be on my way out?RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was,each one, actually, I think we came close.And, I mean, first of all we --nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before,so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream,and we weren't quite sure,when a balloon actually got into the jet stream,whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.And so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic,as we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon --the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour,the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour,and it just took off.And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.And we were just crossing every finger,praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know --something seemed to go wrong every time,and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with mejumped, and left me holding on for dear life.(Laughter)CA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, "I'm out of here!" and ...RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone,the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ...CA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that.RB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon,with my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below,trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which --and it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.But, anyway, we managed to survive it.CA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end?RB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left,and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped,I would only have a couple of minutes of life left.So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately triedto make sure that I was making the right decision.And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again,looked down at those clouds again,climbed back into the capsule again.And then finally, just thought, there's a better way.I've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me,it's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it?And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds,and about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over.And the balloon hit the seaand went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and --CA: What did you write to your family?RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that:just I love you very much. AndI'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which --just in case anything had happened.But fortunately, they never had to use it.CA: Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics.The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls,you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guydoing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing.How much was the PR value part of this?RB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner,the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats,and crashing into the seas.(Laughter)CA: They have a point, Richard.RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying,you know, come on, Richard,there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic.(Laughter)CA: To do all this,you must have been a genius from the get-go, right?RB: Well, I won't contradict that.(Laughter)CA: OK, this isn't exactly hardball. OK.Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school?RB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever.I certainly would have failed IQ tests.And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.And if I -- if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it.As somebody who's dyslexic,you also have some quite bizarre situations.I mean, for instance, I've had to -- you know,I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe,but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross.And so the board meetings have been fascinating.(Laughter)And so, it's like, good news or bad news?And generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news.CA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross?(Laughter)RB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having --(Laughter) --I've got it right.CA: No, trust me, it's gross.(Laughter)RB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said,"Look Richard, here's a -- let me draw on a diagram.Here's a net in the sea,and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net.And that's the profits you've got left over in this little net,everything else is eaten."And I finally worked it all out.(Laughter)(Applause)CA: But, I mean, at school -- so as well as being,you know, doing pretty miserably academically,but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams.So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader,but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ...RB: Yeah, I think I was a bit of a maverick and -- but I ... And I was,yeah, I was fortunately good at sport,and so at least I had something to excel at, at school.CA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life.I mean, there's the story about your motherallegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying "OK, walk home."Did this really happen?RB: She was, you know,she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.So she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for,such as pushing us out of the car,and telling us to find our own way to Granny's,about five miles before we actually got there.And making us go on wonderful, long bike rides.And we were never allowed to watch television and the like.CA: But is there a risk here?I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids,and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and thinkthey're too coddled, they don't know what they've got,we're going to raise a generation of privileged ...RB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids,you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm.So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.CA: You didn't turn out too bad, I have to say, I'm ...Your headmaster said to you --I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school --he said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison,and I'm not sure which.Which of those happened first?(Laughter)RB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first.I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.I was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Actand the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act.On the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which --we had a center where we would help young people who had problems.And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.And there's an ancient law that saysyou can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.So the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest usif we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.We changed it to social diseasesand people came along with acne and spots,but nobody came with VD any more.So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.And then subsequently, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,"the word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrestedfor using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album.And John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.And he asked if I could find a linguistics expertto come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.And so I rang up Nottingham University,and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.And he said, "Look, bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.It's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century."(Laughter)And he went, "Furthermore, I'm a priest myself."And so I said, "Would you mind coming to the court?"And he said he'd be delighted. And I said --and he said, "Would you like me to wear my dog collar?"And I said, "Yes, definitely. Please."(Laughter)CA: That's great.RB: So our key witness argued that it was actually"Never Mind the Priest, Here's the Sex Pistols."(Laughter)And the judge found us -- reluctantly found us not guilty, so ...(Laughter)CA: That is outrageous.(Applause)So seriously, is there a dark side?A lot of people would say there's no waythat someone could put together this incredible collection of businesseswithout knifing a few people in the back,you know, doing some ugly things.You've been accused of being ruthless.There was a nasty biography written about you by someone.Is any of it true? Is there an element of truth in it?RB: I don't actually think that the stereotypeof a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top,generally speaking, works.I think if you treat people well,people will come back and come back for more.And I think all you have in life is your reputationand it's a very small world.And I actually think that the best wayof becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well,and I like to think that's how we run Virgin.CA: And what about the people who love you and who see you spending --you keep getting caught up in these new projects,but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff.You get excited by an idea and, kapow!I mean, do you think about life balance?How do your family feel abouteach time you step into something big and new?RB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important,so from the time the kids were very young,you know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them.And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.Yes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky,we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can --so I can take them there and we can bring friends,and we can play together,but I can also keep in touch with what's going on.CA: You started talking in recent yearsabout this term capitalist philanthropy.What is that?RB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works.You know, the alternative, communism, has not worked.But the problem with capitalism isextreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people,and therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.And I think it's important that the individuals,who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competingfor bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars,but, you know, use that money to either create new jobsor to tackle issues around the world.CA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about,want to turn your resources toward?RB: Well, there's -- I mean there's a lot of issues.I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankindand we are putting a lot of time and energy into,A, trying to come up with alternative fuelsand, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prizein case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels,in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissionscut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point.We need to try to encourage people to come up with a wayof extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere.And we just -- you know, there weren't really peopleworking on that before, so we wanted people to try to --all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that,and also to try to extract the methaneout of the Earth's atmosphere as well.And actually, we've had about 15,000 people fill in the formssaying they want to give it a go.And so we only need one, so we're hopeful.CA: And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects?RB: Yes, I mean, we've got -- we're setting up something calledthe war room, which is maybe the wrong word.We're trying to -- maybe we'll change it -- but anyway, it's a war roomto try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa,all the different social problems in Africa,and try to look at best practices.So, for instance,there's a doctor in Africa that's found thatif you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant,that the baby will not have HIV when it's born.And so disseminating that information toaround the rest of Africa is important.CA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the Westget so excited about -- I mean, they're used to having an idea,getting stuff done, and they believe profoundlyin their ability to make a difference in the world.Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say,we've got to fix this problem and we can do it,I've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da --here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situationand actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that?RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually --we're working with the government on it.I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with acceptingHIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think,of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him,it's a way of working with him, with his government.It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help,they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years.It's got to be consistent.But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-howand help governments approach things slightly differently.For instance, we're setting up clinics in Africawhere we're going to be givingfree antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatmentand free malaria treatment.But we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics,so that people pay for some other aspects.CA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates,or whatever, that this is really being -- it's almost driven bysome sort of desire again, you know, for the right image,for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct.What would you say to them?RB: Well, I think that everybody --people do things for a whole variety of different reasonsand I think that, you know, when I'm on me deathbed,I will want to feel that I've made a differenceto other people's lives.And that may be a selfish thing to think,but it's the way I've been brought up.I think if I'm in a position toradically change other people's lives for the better,I should do so.CA: How old are you?RB: I'm 56.CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand himand I'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s, 40s people are driven bythis desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdomand a search for legacy.I mean, it seems like you're stilla little bit in the growth phases,you're still doing these incredible new plans.How much do you think about legacy,and what would you like your legacy to be?RB: I don't think I think too much about legacy.I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101,so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go.No, I just want to live life to its full.You know, if I can make a difference,I hope to be able to make a difference.And I think one of the positive things at the moment isyou've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance,who are good friends.And, thank God, you've got two peoplewho genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.If they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world,it would be very worrying.And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world.And I think it's importantthat people in that kind of position do make a difference.CA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business,I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of --I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthlessand that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought,well, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way.So I would like to thank you for that inspiration,and for coming to TED today. Thank you.Thank you so much.(Applause)

Chris Anderson: Welcome to TED.Richard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great.CA: Have you met anyone interesting?RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn,because I had an apology to make to her.I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd --she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.And I went home to my wife that nightand she wanted to know why I had another woman's big,massive, big wedding ring on my finger.And, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jewelerand get it cut off.So -- (Laughter) --so apologies to Goldie.CA: That's pretty good.So, we're going to put up some slidesof some of your companies here.You've started one or two in your time.So, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records --I guess it all started with a magazine called Student.And then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this?RB: I read all these sort of TED instructions:you must not talk about your own business, and this,and now you ask me.So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage,since you asked the question.(Laughter)CA: It depends what the answer is though.RB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company,you can really run any companies.I mean, companies are all about finding the right people,inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people.And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitiveand I love taking on, you know, the status quoand trying to turn it upside down.So I've seen life as one long learning process.And if I see -- you know, if I fly on somebody else's airlineand find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't,21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can createthe kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.And so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go.CA: Well, that was a bizarre thing,because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who,at the time when you basically sold Virgin Recordsand invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic,and his view was that you were trading, you know,the world's fourth biggest record companyfor the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.Why did you do that?RB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure.And I think if you start a business without financial backing,you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways.They were trying to put our airline out of business,and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign.And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing downunless I chipped in a chip.And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline,and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company,I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline.CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually,for that as well.RB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.But, yeah, it was sad at the time, but we moved on.CA: Now, you use the Virgin brand a lotand it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other.What does the brand stand for in your head?RB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality,that you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they --CA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit?RB: No, but I was going to move on this.We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it.As I say, we go in and shake up other industries,and I think, you know, we do it differentlyand I think that industries are not quite the sameas a result of Virgin attacking the market.CA: I mean, there are a few launches you've donewhere the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.I mean, Virgin Brides -- what happened there?(Laughter)RB: We couldn't find any customers.(Laughter)(Applause)CA: I was actually also curious why --I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.I mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well?Ain't virgin no longer, or something.RB: Again, we may have had problems finding customers.I mean, we had -- often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints,you know, you can deal with them.But about three months after the launch of the condom company,I had a letter, a complaint,and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely.But obviously, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.And then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken,I got this delightful letter with a picture of the babyasking if I'd be godfather, which I became.So, it all worked out well.CA: Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful.RB: I should have.CA: So, just help us with some of the numbers.I mean, what are the numbers on this?I mean, how big is the group overall?How much -- what's the total revenue?RB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total.CA: And how many employees?RB: About 55,000.CA: So, you've been photographed in various ways at various timesand never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that.What was that? Was that real?RB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.No, I mean, I think --CA: But is that your hair?RB: No.CA: What was that one?RB: Dropping in for tea.CA: OK.(Laughter)RB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which --CA: Oh, that car that we -- actually we --it was a TEDster event there, I think.Is that -- could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute?(Laughter)RB: It's a tough job, isn't it?CA: I mean, it is a tough job.(Laughter)When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as welland they kind of -- they have these different rules over here,it's very strange.RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but --CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about --RB: "Pammy" we launched, you know --mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola,and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy"and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.But the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but --(Laughter)CA: Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps?RB: Of course.CA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice.And, OK, so stop there. This was -- you had some award I think?RB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols'"God Save The Queen," and I'd certainly never expectedthat 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us.But somehow, she must have had a forgetful memory, I think.CA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how?RB: Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard.Occasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richardand think there's some Shakespearean play taking place.But nowhere else anyway.CA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...RB: No. I suppose if you're having problemsgetting a booking in a restaurant or something,that might be worth using it.CA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson.RB: I'll go get the secretary to use it.CA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to,and Virgin Galactic up in the air. (Video)So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?RB: Yeah, it'll be ready in -- well, ready in 12 monthsand then we do 12 months extensive testing.And then 24 months from now,people will be able to take a ride into space.CA: So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed?RB: Philippe has done the -- yeah, quite a bit of it:the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico.And basically, he's just taken an eyeand the space station will be one giant eye,so when you're in space,you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you.And when you land, you'll be able to go back into this giant eye.But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design.CA: But you didn't have him design the engine?RB: Philippe is quite erratic,so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no.CA: He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago.RB: Yeah? No, he is a --CA: Well, some people found it wonderful,some people found it completely bizarre.But, I personally found it wonderful.RB: He's a wonderful enthusiast, which is why I love him. But ...CA: So, now, you've always had this exploration bug in you.Have you ever regretted that?RB: Many times.I mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past.Well, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so --and each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale.So in those moments,you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or --CA: What was the closest you got to --when did you think, this is it, I might be on my way out?RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was,each one, actually, I think we came close.And, I mean, first of all we --nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before,so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream,and we weren't quite sure,when a balloon actually got into the jet stream,whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.And so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic,as we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon --the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour,the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour,and it just took off.And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.And we were just crossing every finger,praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know --something seemed to go wrong every time,and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with mejumped, and left me holding on for dear life.(Laughter)CA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, "I'm out of here!" and ...RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone,the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ...CA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that.RB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon,with my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below,trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which --and it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.But, anyway, we managed to survive it.CA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end?RB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left,and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped,I would only have a couple of minutes of life left.So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately triedto make sure that I was making the right decision.And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again,looked down at those clouds again,climbed back into the capsule again.And then finally, just thought, there's a better way.I've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me,it's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it?And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds,and about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over.And the balloon hit the seaand went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and --CA: What did you write to your family?RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that:just I love you very much. AndI'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which --just in case anything had happened.But fortunately, they never had to use it.CA: Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics.The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls,you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guydoing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing.How much was the PR value part of this?RB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner,the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats,and crashing into the seas.(Laughter)CA: They have a point, Richard.RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying,you know, come on, Richard,there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic.(Laughter)CA: To do all this,you must have been a genius from the get-go, right?RB: Well, I won't contradict that.(Laughter)CA: OK, this isn't exactly hardball. OK.Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school?RB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever.I certainly would have failed IQ tests.And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.And if I -- if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it.As somebody who's dyslexic,you also have some quite bizarre situations.I mean, for instance, I've had to -- you know,I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe,but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross.And so the board meetings have been fascinating.(Laughter)And so, it's like, good news or bad news?And generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news.CA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross?(Laughter)RB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having --(Laughter) --I've got it right.CA: No, trust me, it's gross.(Laughter)RB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said,"Look Richard, here's a -- let me draw on a diagram.Here's a net in the sea,and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net.And that's the profits you've got left over in this little net,everything else is eaten."And I finally worked it all out.(Laughter)(Applause)CA: But, I mean, at school -- so as well as being,you know, doing pretty miserably academically,but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams.So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader,but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ...RB: Yeah, I think I was a bit of a maverick and -- but I ... And I was,yeah, I was fortunately good at sport,and so at least I had something to excel at, at school.CA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life.I mean, there's the story about your motherallegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying "OK, walk home."Did this really happen?RB: She was, you know,she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.So she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for,such as pushing us out of the car,and telling us to find our own way to Granny's,about five miles before we actually got there.And making us go on wonderful, long bike rides.And we were never allowed to watch television and the like.CA: But is there a risk here?I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids,and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and thinkthey're too coddled, they don't know what they've got,we're going to raise a generation of privileged ...RB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids,you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm.So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.CA: You didn't turn out too bad, I have to say, I'm ...Your headmaster said to you --I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school --he said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison,and I'm not sure which.Which of those happened first?(Laughter)RB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first.I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.I was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Actand the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act.On the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which --we had a center where we would help young people who had problems.And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.And there's an ancient law that saysyou can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.So the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest usif we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.We changed it to social diseasesand people came along with acne and spots,but nobody came with VD any more.So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.And then subsequently, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,"the word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrestedfor using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album.And John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.And he asked if I could find a linguistics expertto come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.And so I rang up Nottingham University,and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.And he said, "Look, bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.It's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century."(Laughter)And he went, "Furthermore, I'm a priest myself."And so I said, "Would you mind coming to the court?"And he said he'd be delighted. And I said --and he said, "Would you like me to wear my dog collar?"And I said, "Yes, definitely. Please."(Laughter)CA: That's great.RB: So our key witness argued that it was actually"Never Mind the Priest, Here's the Sex Pistols."(Laughter)And the judge found us -- reluctantly found us not guilty, so ...(Laughter)CA: That is outrageous.(Applause)So seriously, is there a dark side?A lot of people would say there's no waythat someone could put together this incredible collection of businesseswithout knifing a few people in the back,you know, doing some ugly things.You've been accused of being ruthless.There was a nasty biography written about you by someone.Is any of it true? Is there an element of truth in it?RB: I don't actually think that the stereotypeof a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top,generally speaking, works.I think if you treat people well,people will come back and come back for more.And I think all you have in life is your reputationand it's a very small world.And I actually think that the best wayof becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well,and I like to think that's how we run Virgin.CA: And what about the people who love you and who see you spending --you keep getting caught up in these new projects,but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff.You get excited by an idea and, kapow!I mean, do you think about life balance?How do your family feel abouteach time you step into something big and new?RB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important,so from the time the kids were very young,you know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them.And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.Yes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky,we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can --so I can take them there and we can bring friends,and we can play together,but I can also keep in touch with what's going on.CA: You started talking in recent yearsabout this term capitalist philanthropy.What is that?RB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works.You know, the alternative, communism, has not worked.But the problem with capitalism isextreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people,and therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.And I think it's important that the individuals,who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competingfor bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars,but, you know, use that money to either create new jobsor to tackle issues around the world.CA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about,want to turn your resources toward?RB: Well, there's -- I mean there's a lot of issues.I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankindand we are putting a lot of time and energy into,A, trying to come up with alternative fuelsand, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prizein case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels,in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissionscut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point.We need to try to encourage people to come up with a wayof extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere.And we just -- you know, there weren't really peopleworking on that before, so we wanted people to try to --all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that,and also to try to extract the methaneout of the Earth's atmosphere as well.And actually, we've had about 15,000 people fill in the formssaying they want to give it a go.And so we only need one, so we're hopeful.CA: And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects?RB: Yes, I mean, we've got -- we're setting up something calledthe war room, which is maybe the wrong word.We're trying to -- maybe we'll change it -- but anyway, it's a war roomto try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa,all the different social problems in Africa,and try to look at best practices.So, for instance,there's a doctor in Africa that's found thatif you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant,that the baby will not have HIV when it's born.And so disseminating that information toaround the rest of Africa is important.CA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the Westget so excited about -- I mean, they're used to having an idea,getting stuff done, and they believe profoundlyin their ability to make a difference in the world.Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say,we've got to fix this problem and we can do it,I've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da --here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situationand actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that?RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually --we're working with the government on it.I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with acceptingHIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think,of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him,it's a way of working with him, with his government.It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help,they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years.It's got to be consistent.But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-howand help governments approach things slightly differently.For instance, we're setting up clinics in Africawhere we're going to be givingfree antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatmentand free malaria treatment.But we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics,so that people pay for some other aspects.CA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates,or whatever, that this is really being -- it's almost driven bysome sort of desire again, you know, for the right image,for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct.What would you say to them?RB: Well, I think that everybody --people do things for a whole variety of different reasonsand I think that, you know, when I'm on me deathbed,I will want to feel that I've made a differenceto other people's lives.And that may be a selfish thing to think,but it's the way I've been brought up.I think if I'm in a position toradically change other people's lives for the better,I should do so.CA: How old are you?RB: I'm 56.CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand himand I'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s, 40s people are driven bythis desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdomand a search for legacy.I mean, it seems like you're stilla little bit in the growth phases,you're still doing these incredible new plans.How much do you think about legacy,and what would you like your legacy to be?RB: I don't think I think too much about legacy.I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101,so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go.No, I just want to live life to its full.You know, if I can make a difference,I hope to be able to make a difference.And I think one of the positive things at the moment isyou've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance,who are good friends.And, thank God, you've got two peoplewho genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.If they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world,it would be very worrying.And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world.And I think it's importantthat people in that kind of position do make a difference.CA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business,I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of --I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthlessand that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought,well, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way.So I would like to thank you for that inspiration,and for coming to TED today. Thank you.Thank you so much.(Applause)

Three years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made,with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.My idea -- and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night,and we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep --I was excited, with this phone call.I was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets,and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories,and I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunityto tell a warrior's story as it unfolded.So I went to bed that night pretty excited.Not sure of all the details, but excited.It wasn't at four in the morning, but it was closer to midnight.Woke straight up. Wide-awake as could be.And I had this idea: what if I could, in effect, virtually embed,and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers?To tell the story from the inside out, versus the outside in?So, I called back Major Heilshorn,who's the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard.And he knew me, so I was like, "Greg?"He's like, "Yes, Deborah?"Told him my idea, and you know,he is one of the bravest men in the world,as is General Blair, who, in the end, gave me permission to try this experiment.Within 10 days, I was down at Fort Dix.He gave me my pick of units.I picked one unit -- Charlie Company, Third of the 172nd,they're mountain infantry -- for two reasons.One, they're infantry.Number two, they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda,so I knew they would have Internet access.The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer.This was a big thing thatI think when Major H told me,I wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean.So what that meant was, when I went down to Fort Dix,I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision.You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got.The opening one was,"What the fuck do you know about the National Guard?"I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars.Gave them about a nine minute response,and there we went.So, I'd like to show the clip of the film.It's our trailer, because I know, obviously you guys are busy,many of you may not have had a chance to see it.So, I want to show the trailer,and then I'm going to take apart one scene in detail.If we could roll?(Video) Stephen Pink: This is Sergeant Stephen Pink.Michael Moriarty: Specialist Michael Moriarty.Zack Bazzi: Do I really want to go? Probably not.Soldier: We're not supposed to talk to the media.SP: I'm not the media, dammit!MM: The day is here. Life will change.Voice: The real deal, man! Narrator: You ready?Soldier: Bring it on! Narrator: You ready? Voice 2: Iraq, here we come!ZB: Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat.It's natural instinct.SP: If you let fear get to you,then you're not going to be doing your job.MM: Every single time you go out there, there's attacks.It's unbelievable.ZB: Hey, Nestor, your ass crack is right in my face.Soldiers: IV! Are we on fire? IV!Man down! Man down!MM: Keep going, brother. You wanna play?Michael Moriarty's Wife: It's really hard for him to not have his dad.MM: This little kid is in the middle of a war zone.Stephen Pink's Girlfriend: In the beginning, he's like, "Write something dirty!"George W. Bush: The world's newest democracy.MM: They're shooting at me.SP: You don't put 150,000 troops in there,and say we're there to create democracy.Soldier: We've got a drive through window at Burger King now.SP: We're here to create money.MM: I support George Bush. We're not there for the oil.Jon Baril: The worst thing in my life.SP: Baril, don't look at it, bud.Michael Moriarty's Wife: He's not the same person anymore.MM: I will not go back.Kevin Shangraw: The Iraqi people are who we are there to help --and we just killed one.Soldiers: Sergeant Smith is down! Sergeant Smith is down?There they are! Right there! Fire, fire!JB: It'll be a better country in 20 years, 'cause we were there.I hope.(Applause) Deborah Scranton: Thank you.One of the things I'd like to talk to you aboutis having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about.And I'd like to relate an experience I had here at TED.I don't know how many of you might imagine it,but there's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq.Paul? Come on, stand up.This is Paul Anthony.He served -- (Applause) -- with the Marines,and I want to tell you a little, brief story.We were one of the lucky onesto get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software.Right? And we started talking.People will see my tag, and they'll see "The War Tapes,"and then we'll start talking about war.We got in a conversation with some other people in the class,and it went on and on.I mean, we were there for an hour, talking.And it really highlighted something that I would like to askyou guys to think about and hopefully to help with,which is, I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war,and about politics.And really -- because maybe we're going to disagree.Maybe it's going to get uncomfortable.How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation?And you know, Paul was talking,and he then turned to Constance and said,"You know, I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here,because I know she has my back."And I want to say, I was nervous.Because I'm used to doing Q&amp;As.I really related to what James was saying yesterday,because I'm behind the camera.You know, I can answer questions about my movie,but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time.So, I wanted to say, Paul, I'm happy you're here,because I know you have my back.This film was not about the Internet,but it could not have been made without it.The guys' tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me.In the meantime, the soldiers -- we would email and IM.I didn't save all of them,because I didn't realize at the beginningthat it would be something that I would want to keep track of.But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messagesthat I was able to save.The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journeyto really get inside of it.So I wanted to show you a clip,and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together.If we could roll the clip.(Video) SP: Today is sport. [Unclear] Radio: [Unclear] Christian soldiers.SP: We like to give these insurgents a fair chance.So, what we do, we ride with the windows down.Because, you know, we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding.We don't fucking ride with the goddam windows down.It's not true. Very unsafe.Whoa.Soldier: Right there.SP: All right, let's get over to that site.Be advised, we're leaving Taji right now.We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji,we're heading to that location now.Soldier: That's a fucking car bomb!Soldier: Motherfuckers!Soldiers: Get your vest on!Hey, get over the fucking -- yeah, yeah.Any one-four elements get to the gate!SP: Sheriff one-six, or any one-four elements,we need you at the gate of Taji right now, over.Soldier: I'll walk you through it.(Voices)SP: Stay low. Head over to the right.Get your bag, get your bag!(Screams)SP: It was mass casualties.Probably 20 dead, at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis.SP: It just looked like, you know,someone had thrown a quarter through a guy,and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds.Everything was cauterized,and it was just like there was a void going through the body.This is the scene north.They just removed a burnt body, or half a body from here.I don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down.This is blood.And you know, you walk,and you hear the pieces of skin.And that's it, that's all that's left.I remember giving three IVs, bandaging several wounded.Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall, shaking and screaming.Medics who were terrified and couldn't perform.I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji.They can work on the post for pennies, but can't die there.They've got to die outside.If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment,I would've slit his throat right there.21:00 hours, and it's just our squadgoing through today's events in our heads,whether we want to or not.News Anchor: More violence in Iraq.Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens morenear a coalition base north of Baghdad.SP: We made the news.I feel exploited and proud at the same time.I've lost all faith in the media --a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of.I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass.I'll do that, then I'm gonna jerk off.Because these pages smell like Linds,and there won't be any time for jerking off tomorrow.Another mission at 06:00.DS: Now -- (Applause) -- thanks.When I said earlier, to try and tell a story from the inside out, versus the outside in --part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding.It's a new way of trying to make a documentary.When I met the guys, and 10 of them agreed to take cameras --in total, 21 ended up filming.Five soldiers filmed the entire time.There are three featured in the film.The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email,and in it, attached a photo of that burned body out at the car.And the tone from the email was,you know, it had been a very bad day, obviously.And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base.So, I pinged Mike and I said,"Mike, can you please go get that interview with Pink?"Because the thing that very often is missing is,in the military what they call "hot wash."It's that immediate interview after something immediately happens, you know.And if you let time go by,it kind of softens and smooths the edges.And for me, I really wanted that.So, in order to get the intimacy,to share that experience with you, the guys --the two most popular mounts --there was a camera on the turret, the gun turret,and then on the dashboard of the Humvee.Most of the Humvees, we ended up mounting two cameras in them.So you get to experience that in real time, right?The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and didwithin 24 hours of that episode happening.Steve Pink reading his journalhappened five months after he came home.I knew about that journal, but it was very, very private.And you know, you earn someone's trust,especially in doc filmmaking, through your relationship.So, it wasn't until five months after he was homethat he would read that journal.Now, the news footage I put in there to try to show --you know, I think mainstream media tries to do the best they canin the format that they have.But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times,American soldiers saying,"Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do?"OK, this is a perfect example.Pink's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire.They didn't have to go outside the wire.There were not Americans hurt out there.They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives --the Iraqis who work on the post.So, when you may hear soldiers complaining,that's what they're talking about, you know?And I think it's such an amazing gift that they would share thisas a way of bridging.And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q&amp;As,and people are really opinionated.But it seems like people don't want to hear so much,or listen, or try to have an exchange.And I'm as fiery as the next person, but I really think --you know, different speakers have talked about their concern for the world,and my concern is that we have to have these conversations.And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may, you know,we think we know.But we just have to leave that little bit of openness, to know.There's such a disconnect.And for me, it's trying to bridge that disconnect.I'll share one story.I get -- I'm often asked, you know, for me,what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film.And at screenings, inevitably --you know, as I'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff --usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions.And usually, the first questions are,"Oh, what kind of cameras did you use?"Or you know, these things.But there's always a few guys, almost always, who are the last ones.And I've learned over time that those are always the soldiers.And they wait until pretty much everybody's gone.And for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me,that then became my story, was --for those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler --it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents,where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.In this film, there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed.A soldier came up to me and stood, you know really, pretty close,a foot away from me.He's a big guy.And he looked at me, and I smiled,and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes.And he wasn't going to blink.And he said, "My gunner was throwing candy."And I knew what he was going to say.The gunner was throwing candy.They used to throw candy to the kids.Kids got too close, very often.And he said, "I killed a child.And I'm a father. I have children.I haven't been able to tell my wife.I'm afraid she's going to think I'm a monster."I hugged him, of course,and I said, you know, "It's going to be OK."And he said, "I'm going to bring her to see your film.And then I'm going to tell her."So when I talk about a disconnect,it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier,which there obviously are. You know, these days,it's not like World War II, where there was a war front and a home front,and everybody seemed involved.You can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on.And often, I'll hear people say,who maybe know that I did this film,and they say, "Oh, you know, I'm against the war, but I support the soldiers."And I've started to ask them,"Well, that's nice. What are you doing?Are you volunteering at a VA?You go and see anybody?Do you, if you find out your neighbor's been, do you spend some time?Not necessarily ask questions, but see if they want to talk?Do you give money to any of the charities?"You know, obviously, like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing,but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers.I think, I challenge us to say --to operationalize those terms, when we say we support someone, you know?Are you a friend to them?Do you really care?And I would just say it's my hope, and I would ask you guysto please, you know, reach out a hand.And really do give them a hug.Thank you.

It's about making new forms of life.And these are made of this kind of tube --electricity tube, we call it in Holland.And we can start a film about that,And they should survive over there,on their own, in the future.Learning to live on their own --and it'll take couple of more yearsto let them walk on their own.but from the wind.with its nose pointed into the wind.Evolution has generated many species.(Music)This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa.(Music)(Laughter)(Applause)and the winning codes will multiply.You can see this one.Yes, and now it goes from left to right.This is a new generation, a new family,which is able to store the wind.which are on top of that.and the tide is coming up,because they are drowned very easily.(Laughter)I could show you this animal.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)It works the same as a wheel.In fact, this is better than a wheel,you will notice it's very hard to do.And the feet just step over the sand,we have a new wheel.I will show you, in the next video --can you start it, please? --that very heavy loads can be moved.There's a guy pushing there, behind,It's 3.2 tons.You see, it's going the other way.Can I have the feeler here?OK. Good.and one of the big dangers is the sea.This is the sea.And it must feel the water of the sea.And this is the water feeler,and what's very important is this tube.It sucks in air normally,As soon as it touches the water --you should hear a sound of running air.(Sound of running air)Yes!Here we have the brain of the animal.It's a binary step counter.So as soon it has been to the sea,So it's very simple brain.Thank you.One of the biggest enemies are the storms.So when the storm is coming up,it drives a pin into the ground.(Laughter)Audience member: Wow!I still have to help them a lot.Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.(Applause)



erin_mckean_redefines_the_dictionary
946492

Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?You know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought.How about this word?Here, I'll show it to you.Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile."The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite,out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.It's little discrete --that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.And those bits are words.Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer --besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words,like lexicographical.Lexicographical has this great pattern:it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl,I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause)But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."Right? It's a fun word to say,and I get to say it a lot.Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographeris that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.But people think that my job is to let the good wordsmake that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary,and keep the bad words out.But the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.And for another, deciding what words are goodand what words are bad is actually not very easy.And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun,you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.So if I had to think of some kind of occupationas a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of Englishand see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?Well, I blame the Queen.Why do I blame the Queen?Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.But secondly, I blame the Queen becausedictionaries have really not changed.Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionariesis our inclusion of the F-word, which has happenedin American dictionaries since 1965.So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.So he's really responsible for a lot ofwhat we consider modern in dictionaries today.When a guy who looks like that, in that hat,is the face of modernity, you have a problem.And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.There'd be virtually no learning curve.And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!Computers! What about computers?The thing about computers is, I love computers.I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.But computers don't do much else other thanspeed up the process of compiling dictionaries.They don't change the end result.Because what a dictionary is,is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!The design has not changed.And OK, what about online dictionaries, right?Online dictionaries must be different.This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.This is my favorite word, by the way.Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.Very useful word. So, look at that.Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!Right? Those little buttons,I had them all expanded except for the date chart.So there's not very much going on here.There's not a lot of clickiness.And in fact, online dictionaries replicatealmost all the problems of print, except for searchability.And when you improve searchability,you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for,because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.So -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- now, when you think about this,what we have here is a ham butt problem.Does everyone know the ham butt problem?Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away,and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like,"This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?"She thought, "Well, my mom always did this."So she calls up mom, and she says,"Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"So they call grandma, and grandma says,"My pan was too small!" (Laughter)So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.We have a pan that's too small!You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.The bad words -- see, when people think about a placeand they don't find a place on the map,they think, "This map sucks!"When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook,they're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook."When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think,"This must be a bad word." Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?So, you can't get a smaller ham.The English language is as big as it is.So, if you have a ham butt problem,and you're thinking about the ham butt problem,the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive:paper is the enemy of words.How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.Some of my best friends are books.But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.Now they're going to think "Oh, boy.People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"No. There will still be paper dictionaries.When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation,we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries,but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shapedictionaries come in. And it's not going to bethe prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.So, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint,artificial constraints lead toarbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.What if biologists could only study animalsthat made people go, "Aww." Right?What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals,and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna,and not very much about much else.And I think this is a problem.I think we should study all the words,because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressionsfrom very humble parts.Lexicography is really more about material science.We are studying the tolerances of the materialsthat you use to build the structure of your expression:your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me,"Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"They think, "OK, if we think words are the toolsthat we use to build the expressions of our thoughts,how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"They're just the right tools for the job.And so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"You know, anybody who's read a children's bookknows that love makes things real.If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.If you love a word, it becomes real.So if we're not worrying about directing traffic,if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying lessabout control and more about description,then we can think of the English languageas being this beautiful mobile.And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes,is touched, any time you touch a word,you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation,you verb it, you make the mobile move.You didn't break it. It's just in a new position,and that new position can be just as beautiful.Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop --the problem with being a traffic cop isthere can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection,or the cars get confused. Right?But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic,but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.You can ask for help!If you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.Library of Congress: 17 million books,of which half are in English.If only one out of every 10 of those bookshad a word that's not in the dictionary in it,that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.And I find an un-dictionaried word --a word like "un-dictionaried," for example --in almost every book I read. What about newspapers?Newspaper archive goes back to 1759,58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it,it would be an entire other OED.That's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs --and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given weekthan I do Newsweek or Time.There's a lot going on there.And I'm not even talking about polysemy,which is the greedy habit some words have of takingmore than one meaning for themselves.So if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow,a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff,and there's one numbered definition in the OED.The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses."Do you know what that says to me?That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter)That's a lexicographical cop out,to say, "miscellaneous technical senses."So, we have all these words, and we really need help!And the thing is, we could ask for help --asking for help's not that hard.I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers,and this is more of a visual explanation.If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language,these bright spots are what we know about,and the dark spots are where we are in the dark.If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.And we don't even know the shape of the language.If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English --look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida,but there's no California!We're missing California from American English.We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.So again, lexicography is not rocket science.But even if it were, rocket science is being doneby dedicated amateurs these days. You know?It can't be that hard to find some words!So, enough scientists in other disciplinesare really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatcherscan upload information about their bird sightings.And then, ornithologists can goand help track populations, migrations, etc.And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.He's a director of an electroplating company.He's found more than 140 comets.He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.But he found 140 comets without a telescope.He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite,and that's how he found them.If we can find comets without a telescope,shouldn't we be able to find words?Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.And the Internet is great for collecting words,because the Internet's full of collectors.And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet,but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.And words and enthusiasm actually happen to bethe recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now,but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.They show the word, but they don't show any context.Where did it come from? Who said it?What newspaper was it in? What book?Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact,it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.So a word without its source is like a cut flower.You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.It dies too fast.So, this whole time I've been saying,"The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because,well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.They use it synecdochically.And one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically"is that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically."This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the pointwhere I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something --like the dictionary is a part of the language,or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country --then you're using it synecdochically.But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.We can put in all the meanings.Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language --we can make it be the whole language.You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son,who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely rememberthat this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.This is what dictionaries used to look like.I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.It wasn't really what people needed.And the thing is, if we can put in all the words,no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad,we can really describe the language like scientists.We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing,and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.Thank you very much for your kind attention.

I've actually been waiting by the phonefor a call from TED for years.And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.In 2003, I was ready to do a talkabout the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.In 2004, I started Participant Productionsand we had a really good first year, and no call.And finally, I get a call last year,and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.(Laughter)You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.(Laughter)When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,I had some misgivings.But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.(Laughter)And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valleyhave a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.(Laughter)Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.Hollywood gathers around power tables,and the Valley gathers around power tables.So it turned out there was a lot more in commonthan I would have dreamed.But I'm actually here today to tell a story.And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,and they want to know what drives you a bit.And what really drives me is a vision of the futurethat I think we all share.It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.And when we heard a lot of the presentationsover the last couple of days,Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,I think we all realized how far we have to goto get to this new version of humanitythat I like to call "Humanity 2.0."And it's also something that resides in each of us,to close what I thinkare the two big calamities in the world today.One is the gap in opportunity --this gap that President Clinton last nightcalled uneven, unfair and unsustainable --and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and diseaseand all these evils that we see around us.But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad ideathat an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.And I think that's just a horrible thing.And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,because within each of us is the power toequal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.And if the men and women of TEDcan't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.And for me, a lot of this started when I was youngerand my family used to go camping in upstate New York.And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,except get beaten up by my sister or read books.And so I used to read authors like James Michenerand James Clavell and Ayn Rand.And their stories made the world seem a very smalland interconnected place.And it struck me that if I could write storiesthat were about this world as being small and interconnected,that maybe I could get people interested in the issuesthat affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.And my dad came home one dayand announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.But for a young man that made a real impression on me,that one never knows how much time one really has.So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.I started a couple of businessesthat I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.One of those businesses was a computer rental businesscalled Micros on the Move,which is very well named,because people kept stealing the computers.(Laughter)So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.And while I was there, I made friends with a fellownamed Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologizefor this. This is a photo from the old days.And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to mewith this idea to help peoplebuy and sell things online with each other.And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,I said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea."(Laughter)And needless to say, I was right.(Laughter)But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobsto build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.The company went public two years laterand is today one of the best known companies in the world.Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.But for me, personally, it was a real change.I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Altoand living off their leftovers,to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.And I wanted to figure out how I couldtake the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.And around that time, I met John Gardner,who is a remarkable man.He was the architect of the Great Society programsunder Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,or anyone could do, to make a differencein the long-term issues facing humanity.And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.Bet on good people doing good things."And that really resonated with me.I started a foundationto bet on these good people doing good things.These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,who are using business skills in a very leveraged wayto solve social problems.People today we call social entrepreneurs.And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,who started the Grameen Bank,has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,won the Nobel Peace Prize.But there's also a lot of people that you don't know.Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,because she felt girls' education was lagging.And she started it about 10 years ago,and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,also known as black fever.And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,which is really a scourge in the developing world.And so this is one way to beton good people doing good things.And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of changethat I find really is powerful.It's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate."And invest: if you see good people doing good things,invest in them. Invest in their organizations,or in business. Invest in these folks.Connecting them together through conferences --like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurshipthat my foundation does at Oxford every year.And celebrate them: tell their stories,because not only are there good people doing good work,but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,that really got me back to thinking when I was a kidand wanted to tell stories to get people involvedin the issues that affect us all.And a light bulb went off,which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?And I thought about the films that inspired me,films like "Gandhi" and "Schindler's List."And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.And there really wasn't a specific companythat was focused on the public interest.So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angelesto talk about the idea of a pro-social media companyand I was met with a lot of encouragement.One of the lines of encouragementthat I heard over and over was,"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,who think you're going to come to this town and make movies."And then of course, there was the other adage."The surest way to become a millionaireis to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."(Laughter)Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productionswith the vision to be a global media companyfocused on the public interest.And our mission is to produce entertainmentthat creates and inspires social change.And we don't just want people to see our moviesand say, that was fun, and forget about it.We want them to actually get involved in the issues.In 2005, we launched our first slate of films,"Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana"and "Good Night and Good Luck."And much to my surprise, they were noticed.We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.Perhaps more importantly,tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programsand the activism programsthat we created to go around the movies.And we had an online component of that,our community sect called Participate.net.But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and theSierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,there was actually something they could do to make a difference.One of these films in particular, called "North Country," was actuallykind of a box office disaster.But it was a film that starred Charlize Theronand it was about women's rights, women's empowerment,domestic violence and so on.And we released the film at the same time thatthe Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,and with our social sector partners,like the National Organization of Women,the film was widely creditedwith influencing the successful renewal of the act.And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's --the film started about a true-life storyabout a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,and the Violence Against Women Act and others.And then the movie about this person doing these things,then led to this greater renewal.And so again,it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al --I first saw Al do his slide show presentationon global warming in May of 2005.At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.And after we saw his slide show,it became clear that it was much more urgent.And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, andwith Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,and Davis Guggenheim,who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,because we felt that we could get the message out therefar more quickly than having Al go around the world,speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood,that nobody knows nothing about anything.And I really thought this was going to bea straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.And so it was a great shock to all of uswhen the film really captured the public interest,and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,and most of Scandinavia.We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.and it's really changed the debate on global warming.It was also a pretty good year for this guy.We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.(Laughter)And for Participant, this is just the start.Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.And we have 10 films in production right now,and dozens others in development.I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, andhow he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,"based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.And we think once people see these films,they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the worldand the Middle East in general.We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,Abby Hoffman and crew,and, again, a story about a small group of individualswho did make change in the world.And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carterand his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --(Laughter)-- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunityto make change in their own way.And all the people in this roomhave done so through their business lives,or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.And one thing that I've learnedis that there's never one right way to make change.One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,but every one of us is all of those things and more.And I believe if we do these things,we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.And I can imagine, if we do this,the headlines in 10 years might read something like these:"New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,""U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" --(Applause)-- "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence."(Applause)And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."(Laughter)And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.And I believe that, working together,we can make all of these things happen.And I want to thank you all for having me here today.It's been a real honor. Thank you.(Applause)Oh, thank you.

really thought this was going to bea straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.And so it was a great shock to all of uswhen the film really captured the public interest,and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,and most of Scandinavia.We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.and it's really changed the debate on global warming.It was also a pretty good year for this guy.We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.(Laughter)And for Participant, this is just the start.Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.And we have 10 films in production right now,and dozens others in development.I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, andhow he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,"based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.And we think once people see these films,they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the worldand the Middle East in general.We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,Abby Hoffman and crew,and, again, a story about a small group of individualswho did make change in the world.And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carterand his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --(Laughter)-- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunityto make change in their own way.And all the people in this roomhave done so through their business lives,or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.And one thing that I've learnedis that there's never one right way to make change.One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,but every one of us is all of those things and more.And I believe if we do these things,we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.And I can imagine, if we do this,the headlines in 10 years might read something like these:"New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,""U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" --(Applause)-- "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence."(Applause)And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."(Laughter)And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.And I believe that, working together,we can make all of these things happen.And I want to thank you all for having me here today.It's been a real honor. Thank you.(Applause)Oh, thank you.

I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa --those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid.And, of course, I’m dedicating it also to my grandmother,whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles,especially for me when I was an activist, and being harassed by the police.You will recall that in 1976, June 16, the students of South Africa boycottedthe language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor,as they were sort of like really toldthat they must do everything in Afrikaans --biology, mathematics -- and what about our languages?And the students wanted to speak to the government,and police answered with bullets.So every year, June 16, we will commemorateall those comrades or students who died.And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years,and I started asking questions,and that’s when my political education started.And I joined, later on, the youth organizationunder the African National Congress.So as part of organizing this and whatever,this commemoration, the police will round us upas they call us leaders.And I used to run away from home,when I know that maybe the police might be comingaround the ninth or 10th of June or so.And my grandmother one time said,"No, look, you’re not going to run away.This is your place, you stay here."And indeed, the police came -- because they’ll just arrest usand put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so.So it was on the 10th of June, and they came, and they surrounded the house,and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house,and opened the kitchen door.And she said to them, "Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight.I'm tired of you having to come here, harassing us,while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes.He is here, and you're not going to take him.I've got a bowl full of boiling water -- the first one who comes in here, gets it."And they left.(Applause) (Music)♫ Thula Mama, Thula Mama, Thula Mama, Thula Mama. ♫♫ Through the mist of the tears in your eyes on my childhood memory, ♫♫ I know the truth in your smile, ♫♫ I know the truth in your smile, ♫♫ piercing through the gloom of my ignorance. ♫♫ Oh, there is a mama lying down sleeping ♫♫ you're very ill and your heart crying. ♫♫ Wondering, wondering, wondering, wondering where is this world coming to. ♫♫ Is it right the children have to fend for themselves?

Thula Mama Mama. ♫♫ Thula Mama, Thula Mama, Thula Mama Mama, Thula Mama ♫♫ Tomorrow it’s going to be better. ♫♫ Tomorrow it's going to be better to climb, Mama. ♫♫ Thula Mama, Thula Mama. ♫♫ Am I to break into the song like the blues man or troubadour. ♫♫ And then from long distance in no blues club am I to sing, ♫♫ baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. ♫♫ Should I now stop singing of love, ♫♫ now that my memory’s surrounded by blood? ♫♫ Sister, why oh why do we at times mistake a pimple for a cancer? ♫♫ So who are they who says, no more love poems now? ♫♫ I want to sing a song of love ♫♫ for that woman who jumped the fences pregnant ♫♫ and still gave birth to a healthy child. ♫♫ Softly I walk into the sun rays of the smile ♫♫ that will ignite my love song, my song of life, ♫♫ my song of love, my song of life, my song of love, ♫♫ my song of life, my song of love, my song of life. ♫♫ Ooh, I’ve not tried to run away from song, ♫♫ I hear a persistent voice, more powerful than the enemy bombs. ♫♫ The song that washed our lives and the rains of our blood. ♫♫ My song of love and my song of life, my song of love, ♫♫ my song of life, my song of love, ♫♫ my song of life, my song of love -- I want everybody to sing with me -- ♫♫ my song of life, my song of love, my song of life -- everybody sing with me -- ♫♫ my song of life, my song of love -- I can’t hear you -- ♫♫ my song of love, my song of life -- you can do better -- ♫♫ my song of life, my song of love -- keep singing, keep singing -- ♫♫ my song of love, my song of life, yes, my song of love -- ♫♫ you can do better than that -- ♫♫ my song of life, yes, my song of love, my song of life, my song of love -- ♫♫ keep singing, keep singing, keep singing -- my song of love. ♫♫ Oh yeah.

I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa.I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago,and a Nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make senseif you've ever watched a James Bond movie --and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes,"Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!"(Laughter)It was great.So, I've got a little sheet of paper here,mostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone,I'll talk for like two hours.I just want to say good afternoon, good evening.It's been an incredible few days.It's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris.But also, most importantly, all the invisible people behind TEDthat you just see flitting around the whole placethat have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation.It's really amazing.I've been in the audience.I'm a writer, and I've been watching people with the slide showsand scientists and bankers, and I've been feeling a bitlike a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah.(Laughter)Like, what have I got to say about all this?And I was watching Jane [Goodall] yesterday,and I thought it was really great, and I was watchingthose incredible slides of the chimpanzees, and I thought,"Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk, you know? What would it say?"My first thought was, "Well, you know, there's George Bush."But then I thought, "Why be rude to chimpanzees?"I guess there goes my green card.(Laughter)There's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa.And what's become increasingly clear to me is thatwe're talking about news stories about Africa;we're not really talking about African narratives.And it's important to make a distinction, because if the news is anything to go by,40 percent of Americans can't -- either can't afford health insuranceor have the most inadequate health insurance,and have a president who, despite the protestof millions of his citizens -- even his own Congress --continues to prosecute a senseless war.So if news is anything to go by,the U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe, right?Which it isn't really, is it?And talking about war, my girlfriend has this great t-shirtthat says, "Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity."It's amazing, isn't it?The truth is, everything we know about America,everything Americans come to know about being American,isn't from the news.I live there.We don't go home at the end of the day and think,"Well, I really know who I am nowbecause the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchangeclosed at this many points."What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories.It comes from the novels, the movies, the fashion magazines.It comes from popular culture.In other words, it's the agents of our imaginationwho really shape who we are. And this is important to remember,because in Africathe complicated questions we want to ask aboutwhat all of this means has been askedfrom the rock paintings of the San people,through the Sundiata epics of Mali, to modern contemporary literature.If you want to know about Africa, read our literature --and not just "Things Fall Apart," because that would be like saying,"I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America."That's very important.There's a poem by Jack Gilbert called "The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart."He says, "When the Sumerian tablets were first translated,they were thought to be business records.But what if they were poems and psalms?My love is like twelve Ethiopian goatsstanding still in the morning light.Shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body.Giraffes are this desire in the dark."This is important.It's important because misreading is really the chancefor complication and opportunity.The first Igbo Bible was translated from Englishin about the 1800s by Bishop Crowther,who was a Yoruba.And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language,and so they'll say the word "igwe" and "igwe":same spelling, one means "sky" or "heaven,"and one means "bicycle" or "iron."So "God is in heaven surrounded by His angels"was translated as --[Igbo].And for some reason, in Cameroon, when they triedto translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois,they chose the Igbo version.And I'm not going to give you the patois translation;I'm going to make it standard English.Basically, it ends up as "God is on a bicycle with his angels."This is good, because language complicates things.You know, we often think that language mirrorsthe world in which we live, and I find that's not true.The language actually makes the world in which we live.Language is not -- I mean, things don't haveany mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value.And language can't be understood in its abstraction.It can only be understood in the context of story,and everything, all of this is story.And it's important to remember that,because if we don't, then we become ahistorical.We've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here.But these are not new to Africa.Nigeria got its independence in 1960.The first time the possibility for independence was discussedwas in 1922, following the Aba women's market riots.In 1967, in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War,Dr. Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine.So, you know, the thing is to remember thatbecause otherwise, 10 years from now,we'll be back here trying to tell this story again.So, what it says to me then is that it's not really --the problem isn't really the stories that are being toldor which stories are being told,the problem really is the terms of humanitythat we're willing to bring to complicate every story,and that's really what it's all about.Let me tell you a Nigerian joke.Well, it's just a joke, anyway.So there's Tom, Dick and Harry and they're working construction.And Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it,and he goes on this rant about, "Twenty years,my wife has been packing rice for lunch.If she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myselfoff this building and kill myself."And Dick and Harry repeat this.The next day, Tom opens his lunchbox, there's rice,so he throws himself off and kills himself,and Tom, Dick and Harry follow.And now the inquest -- you know, Tom's wifeand Dick's wife are distraught.They wished they'd not packed rice.But Harry's wife is confused, because she said, "You know,Harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years."(Laughter)This seemingly innocent joke, when I heard it as a child in Nigeria,was told about Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa,with the Hausa being Harry.So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harrybecomes a way to spread ethnic hatred.My father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s.In fact, every time I read in Ireland,people get me all mistaken and they say,"Oh, this is Chris O'Barney from Cork."But he was also in Oxford in the '50s,and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria,my father used to say to me, "You must never eat or drinkin a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you."It makes sense now when I think about it,because if you'd known my father,you would've wanted to poison him too.(Laughter)So I was born in 1966, at the beginningof the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, and the war ended after three years.And I was growing up in school and the federal governmentdidn't want us taught about the history of the war,because they thought it probably would make usgenerate a new generation of rebels.So I had a very inventive teacher, a Pakistani Muslim,who wanted to teach us about this.So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history,and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz,I learned the melancholic history of my peoplethrough the melancholic history of another people.I mean, picture this -- really picture this.A Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust historyto young Igbo children.Story is powerful.Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody.And it should come as no surprisethat my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazistaking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich.It makes perfect sense.And they were to blow up strategic targetsand take over the country, and they were foiledby a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams,and a Jewish Nazi hunter.And it happened over four continents.And when the book came out, I was heralded as Africa's answerto Frederick Forsyth, which is a dubious honor at best.But also, the book was launched in time for me to be accusedof constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt.So at 18, I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria.I grew up very privileged, and it's importantto talk about privilege, because we don't talk about it here.A lot of us are very privileged.I grew up -- servants, cars, televisions, all that stuff.My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the storyI encountered in prison, and I had no language for it.I was completely terrified, completely broken,and kept trying to find a new language,a new way to make sense of all of this.Six months after that, with no explanation,they let me go.Now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables knowthat it was because it was costing them too much to feed me.(Laughter)But I mean, I grew up with this incredible privilege,and not just me -- millions of Nigeriansgrew up with books and libraries.In fact, we were talking last night about how allof the steamy novels of Harold Robbinshad done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africathan any sex education programs ever had.All of those are gone.We are squandering the most valuable resourcewe have on this continent: the valuable resourceof the imagination.In the film, "Sometimes in April" by Raoul Peck,Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised,and he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend --fellow Rwandan Army officer, albeit a Tutsi --played by Fraser James.And Fraser's on his knees, arms tied behind his back,and he's crying.He's sniveling.It's a pitiful sight.And as we watch it, we are ashamed.And we want to say to Idris, "Chop him up.Shut him up."And as Idris moves, Fraser screams, "Stop!Please stop!"Idris pauses, then he moves again,and Fraser says, "Please!Please stop!"And it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us;it's the look in Fraser's eyes.It's one that says, "Don't do this.And I'm not saying this to save myself,although this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you,because if you do this, you will be lost."To be so afraid that you're standing in the faceof a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourselfand crying, but to say in that moment,as Fraser says to Idris, "Tell my girlfriend I love her."In that moment, Fraser says,"I am lost already, but not you ... not you."This is a redemption we can all aspire to.African narratives in the West, they proliferate.I really don't care anymore.I'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves --how as a writer, I find that African writershave always been the curators of our humanity on this continent.The question is, how do I balance narratives that are wonderfulwith narratives of wounds and self-loathing?And this is the difficulty that I face.I am trying to move beyond political rhetoricto a place of ethical questioning.I am asking us to balance the ideaof our complete vulnerability with the complete notionof transformation of what is possible.As a young middle-class Nigerian activist,I launched myself along with a whole generation of usinto the campaign to stop the government.And I asked millions of people,without questioning my right to do so,to go up against the government.And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed.I justified it, and I said, "This is the cost of revolution.Have I not myself been imprisoned?Have I not myself been beaten?"It wasn't until later, when I was imprisoned again,that I understood the real meaning of torture,and how easy your humanity can be taken from you,for the time I was engaged in war,righteous, righteous war.Excuse me.Sometimes I can stand before the world --and when I say this, transformationis a difficult and slow process --sometimes I can stand before the world and say,"My name is Chris Abani.I have been human six days, but only sometimes."But this is a good thing.It's never going to be easy.There are no answers.As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth,that I had challenged my students in America --I said, "You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots."And so they said, "Tell me about Africa, Professor Abani."So I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa.And the truth be told, this is it, isn't it?There are no essential Africans,and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone elseabout the continent we come from,and yet we want to make profound statements about it.And I think if we can just admit that we're all tryingto approximate the truth of our own communities,it will make for a much more nuancedand a much more interesting conversation.I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this,that we can rise above all of this.When I was 10, I read James Baldwin's "Another Country,"and that book broke me.Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and lovefor the first time, but because the way James wrote about itmade it impossible for me to attach otherness to it."Here," Jimmy said."Here is love, all of it."The fact that it happens in "Another Country"takes you quite by surprise.My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world:those who can count, and those who can't.(Laughter)He also says that the cause of all our troubleis the belief in an essential, pure identity:religious, ethnic, historical, ideological.I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaathat speaks to transformation.It's called "Ode to the Drum," and I'll try and read itthe way Yusef would be proud to hear it read."Gazelle, I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch,for how easy it is to be nailed to a boardweathered raw as white butcher paper.Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet.You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell.Weeks ago, you broke me as a womanonce shattered me into a song beneath her weight,before you slouched into that grassy hush.And now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage,shaped like five bowstrings.Ghosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum.You've been seasoned by wind, dusk and sunlight.Pressure can make everything whole again.Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood,your face has been carved five times.I have to drive trouble in the hills.Trouble in the valley,and trouble by the river too.There is no palm wine, fish, salt, or calabash.Kadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom.Ka-doooom.Now I have beaten a song back into you.Rise and walk away like a panther."Thank you.(Applause)

I'm a medical illustrator,and I come from a slightly different point of view.I've been watching, since I grew up,the expressions of truth and beauty in the artsand truth and beauty in the sciences.And while these are both wonderful things in their own right --they both have very wonderful things going for them --truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciencesand by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twinsthat a scientist would want to date.(Laughter)These are expressions of truth as awe-full things,by meaning they are things you can worship.They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.They are unique. They are useful --sometimes, often a long time after the fact.And you can actually roll some of the pictures now,because I don't want to look at me on the screen.Truth and beauty are thingsthat are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.They are things that describe beauty in a waythat is often only accessible if you understand the languageand the syntax of the personwho studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.If you look at the math, E=mc squared,if you look at the cosmological constant,where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolvefrom the numbers that describe the universe --these are things that are really difficult to understand.And what I've tried to dosince I had my training as a medical illustrator --since I was taught animation by my father,who was a sculptor and my visual mentor --I wanted to figure out a way to help peopleunderstand truth and beauty in the biological sciencesby using animation, by using pictures, by telling storiesso that the things that are not necessarily evident to peoplecan be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.Students today are often immersed in an environmentwhere what they learn is subjects that have truth and beautyembedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalizedand it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beautyare not always evident.It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soupwhere you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.We don't want to do that to our students.So we have an opportunity to really open up education.And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard,in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department,a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and Iwould be interested and willing to really changehow medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell --that would explore the truth and beauty inherentin molecular and cellular biologyso that students could understand a larger picturethat they could hang all of these facts on.They could have a mental image of the cellas a large, bustling, hugely complicated citythat's occupied by micro-machines.And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.These micro-machines,which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,are self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devicesthat are made out of strings of amino acids.And these micro-machines power how a cell moves.They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.They power our minds.And so what we wanted to do was to figure outhow we could make this story into an animationthat would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,which is a website that Harvard hasfor its molecular and cellular biology studentsthat will -- in addition to all the textual information,in addition to all the didactic stuff --put everything together visually, so that these studentswould have an internalized view of what a cell really isin all of its truth and beauty, and be able to studywith this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,so that their passions would be sparkedand so that they would be able to go onand use these visions in their head to make new discoveriesand to be able to find out, really, how life works.So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophagesthat are streaming down a capillary,and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall,and they're picking up information from cellsthat are on the capillary wall, and they are given this informationthat there's an inflammation somewhere outside,where they can't see and sense.But they get the information that causes them to stop,causes them to internalize that they need to makeall of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.So these molecular motors -- we had to workwith the Harvard scientists and databank modelsof the atomically accurate moleculesand figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.And figure out how to do this in a waythat was truthful in that it imparted what was going on,but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cellwould prevent the vista from happening.And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minuteReader's Digest version of the first aspect of this filmthat we produced. It's an ongoing projectthat's going to go another four or five years.And I want you to look at thisand see the paths that the cell manufactures --these little walking machines, they're called kinesins --that take these huge loadsthat would challenge an ant in relative size.Run the movie, please.But these machines that power the inside of the cellsare really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all lifebecause all of these machines interact with each other.They pass information to each other.They cause different things to happen inside the cell.And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needson the fly, from informationthat's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.No life, from the smallest life to everybody here,would be possible without these little micro-machines.In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines,have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.(Laughter)(Music)This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell.This little guy is called the kinesin,and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteinsto wherever it's needed in the cell --whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle,whether it's to build something or repair something.And each of us has about 100,000 of these thingsrunning around, right now,inside each one of your 100 trillion cells.So no matter how lazy you feel,you're not really intrinsically doing nothing.(Laughter)So what I want you to do when you go homeis think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.And think about some of the thingsthat we're learning about cellular mechanics.Once we figure out all that's going on --and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on --once we figure out what's going on,we're really going to be able to have a lot of controlover what we do with our health,with what we do with future generations,and how long we're going to live.And hopefully we'll be able to use thisto discover more truth, and more beauty.(Music)But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines,are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.And their working together helps our bodies --huge entities that they will never see -- function properly.Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.(Applause)

This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times.The punch line?"On the other hand, I don't have to get up at fourevery single morning to milk my Labrador."This is a recent cover of New York Magazine.Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment,births, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies.And this is a song medley I put together --(Music)Did you ever notice that four in the morning has becomesome sort of meme or shorthand?It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour.(Laughter)A time for inconveniences, mishaps, yearnings.A time for plotting to whack the chief of police,like in this classic scene from "The Godfather."Coppola's script describes these guys as, "exhausted in shirt sleeves.It is four in the morning."(Laughter)A time for even grimmer stuff than that,like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's"The House of the Spirits."After the breathtaking green-haired Rosa is murdered,the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste.They worked until four o'clock in the morning.A time for even grimmer stuff than that,like in last April's New Yorker magazine.This short fiction piece by Martin Amisstarts out, "On September 11, 2001, he opened his eyesat 4 a.m. in Portland, Maine,and Mohamed Atta's last day began."For a time that I find to be the most placidand uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure getsan awful lot of bad press --(Laughter)across a lot of different media from a lot of big names.And it made me suspicious.I figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really,aren't all defaulting back to this one easy tropelike they invented it, right?Could it be there is something more going on here?Something deliberate, something secret,and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway?I say this guy -- Alberto Giacometti, shown herewith some of his sculptures on the Swiss 100 franc note.He did it with this famous piecefrom the New York Museum of Modern Art.Its title -- "The Palace at Four in the Morning --(Laughter)1932.Not just the earliest cryptic referenceto four in the morning I can find.I believe that this so-called first surrealist sculpturemay provide an incredible key to virtuallyevery artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it.I call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive.No, feel free to follow along on your Blackberriesor your iPhones if you've got them.It works a little something like -- this is a recent Google searchfor four in the morning.Results vary, of course. This is pretty typical.The top 10 results yield youfour hits for Faron Young's song, "It's Four in the Morning,"three hits for Judi Dench's film, "Four in the Morning,"one hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem, "Four in the Morning."But what, you may ask, do a Polish poet, a British Dame,a country music hall of famer all have in commonbesides this totally excellent Google ranking?Well, let's start with Faron Young -- who was born incidentallyin 1932.(Laughter)In 1996, he shot himself in the head on December ninth --which incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday.(Laughter)But he didn't die on Dench's birthday.He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbedto a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 --which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died.Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this?She has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi.On that very day, December 10, 1996 while Mr. Four in the Morning,Faron Young, was giving up the ghost in Nashville, Tennessee,Ms. Four in the Morning -- or one of them anyway -- Wislawa Szymborskawas in Stockholm, Sweden, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.100 years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself.Coincidence? No, it's creepy.(Laughter)Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric.That's like me telling you,"Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901,which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?"No, not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm,but that does not mean there's not something going onat the highest possible levels.In fact there are people in this roomwho may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see.(Laughter)Video: Homer Simpson: We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room --You mean if I want pork chops, even in the middle of the night,your guy will fry them up?Herbert Powell: Sure, that's what he's paid for.Now do you need towels, laundry, maids?HS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- let me see if I got this straight.It is Christmas Day, 4 a.m.There's a rumble in my stomach.Marge Simpson: Homer, please.Rives: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.Let me see if I got this straight, Matt.(Laughter)When Homer Simpson needs to imaginethe most remote possible moment of not just the clock,but the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400on the birthday of the Baby Jesus.And no, I don't know how it worksinto the whole puzzling scheme of things, but obviouslyI know a coded message when I see one.(Laughter)I said, I know a coded message when I see one.And folks, you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's "My Life"from the bookstore here at TED.Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want.Or you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt.And how far down into it you figure we'll have to scrollto get to the golden ticket?Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs?This is page 474 on your paperbacks if you're following along:"Though it was getting better, I still wasn't satisfiedwith the inaugural address.My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair outbecause as we worked between one and four in the morningon Inauguration Day, I was still changing it."Sure you were, because you've prepared your entire lifefor this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you.And then --(Laughter)three paragraphs later we get this little beauty:"We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time.It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m."Well, how could it have?By his own writing, this man was either asleep,at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launcha nuclear missile out of a suitcase.What happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day?What happened to William Jefferson Clinton?We might not ever know.And I noticed, he's not exactly around here todayto face any tough questions.(Laughter)It could get awkward, right?I mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch.But if he were here --(Laughter)he might remind us, as he does in the wrap-up to his fine autobiography,that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey --a journey that saw him go on to becomethe first Democrat president electedto two consecutive terms in decades.In generations.The first since this man, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,who began his own unprecedented journeyway back at his own first election,way back in a simpler time, way back in 1932 --(Laughter)the year Alberto Giacometti(Laughter)made "The Palace at Four in the Morning."The year, let's remember, that this voice, now departed,first came a-cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours.(Music)(Applause)

I've always wanted to be a cyborg.(Laughter)wearing this around,swallowing swords on stage here,so I figure it's OK amongst this group.up to sixth grade in Atlanta, Georgia.People call me a game designer,and the way she went about things,to discover things on their ownof life and nature through play.And so, the games that I do,So a few years ago,And that's the way I work.that I did as I was learning that subject.And it led me to astrobiology,And then Drake's equation,Things where you might trip across thingsIt's getting pretty close to finished now.swimming around.but it helps to make it cute.and as you play the game,And as we start growing,at the cellular scale.I'm going to skip ahead here.At some point we get larger,the player is designing their creature,and that's a fundamental aspect of this.You know, very Darwinian.is that players love making stuff.Even if it wasn't as prettyit really stuck with themand now we might try to eat.and try and eat him.OK, well, we fight.(Creatures grunting)OK, we got him.Now we get a meal.So really, at this part of the game,and also getting to the next generation,We can mate, so I'm going to see(Creatures grunting)because it's almost more interestingNow, once we mate, we click on the egg.But basically, this is the editorso you sculpt it like clay.anything they can think of in this editor,and we'll basically bring it to life.I'll inflate them kind of large.I'll put mouths on the limbs.And I'll also give it a few legs.So in some sensethat an eight-year-old can use.But really the goal here was,OK, now I'll put some hands on it.OK, so that's the complete model.of the topology of this creature.And I can see how it might dance.(Laughter)So it's acting with its two mouths there.I can even have it pose for a photo.Snap a little photo of it.(Laughter)So then I bring this back into the game.So the process of playing the gameup through civilization.eventually become intelligent.Eventually they would go out into space,Now, really, in some sense,How do we make the gameplay,up to this point in the game.As we pull down here,that's going on with the creatures.Some of these were created by the player,that you have to balance actively.Also with this phase,So I can come in and I can do things,So one of the things I can doand so that's what I'm doing here.So as I start pumping in more atmosphere,and if you'll start noticing,because a lot of these are coastal cities.a huge amount of failure space.So there goes one city.So at first what we're going to seewe'll see the heat impact of that as well.Not only will it get hotter,So basically, what we're getting hereand as it keeps getting hotter,food webs and all that --And what's interesting to me about gamesbut when you can give them a toy,It's almost in the same wayacross vast scales of both space and time.So here's our little solar system,Let's fly to another one.As we move into the future,And all my favorite science fiction moviesThis planet actually has some life on it.is a monolith that I can drop down.(Laughter)Now, as you can see,and then make them sentient.I can get out of the UFO and walk up,At first they're a little freaked out.OK, well maybe they're not worshipping me.(Laughter)the players can play through this.I want to be able to play"Star Trek," "War Of the Worlds."Now, as we pull away from this world --when I was a kidAs we pull away from the star here,as wonderfully 3D as it is actually is.And also show the dynamics,But these are the thingsSo here's a little black holeBut we also have stars and things as well.kind of slowly in motion.Typically, when people present galaxies,with the disk slowly rotating,to somebody in a very imaginative way,Because if you think about it,They might be a nurturing god.You might be a vengeful god, conquesting,I could possibly make in the world,that I would choose to make,are the result of short-term thinking,what it's going to be like in 100 years,Thank you.

So I really consider myself a storyteller.But I don't really tell stories in the usual way,in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.Instead, I'm really interested in building tools that allowlarge numbers of other people to tell their stories,people all around the world.I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.I think people are very similar,but I also think that we have trouble seeing that.You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps,and I think we all see a lot of gaps.And we define ourselves by our gaps.There's language gaps,there's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps,there's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps,there's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps,there's also religious gaps.You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gapsbecause they make us feel like we identify with something,some smaller community.But I think that actually, despite our gaps,we really have a lot in common.And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep needto express ourselves.I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new.But the thing about self-expressionis that there's traditionally been this imbalancebetween the desire that we have to express ourselvesand the number of sympathetic friendswho are willing to stand around and listen.(Laughter)This, also, is nothing new.Since the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalanceby making art, writing poems, singing songs,scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper,gossiping with friends. This is nothing new.What's new is that in the last several yearsa lot of these very traditional physical human activities,these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.And as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints,footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.And so what I do is, I write computer programsthat study very large sets of these footprints,and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them --what they feel, what they think,what's different in the world today than usual,these sorts of questions.One project that explores these ideas,which was made about a year ago,is a piece called We Feel Fine.This is a piece that every two or three minutesscans the world's newly-posted blog entriesfor occurrences of the phrases "I feel" or "I am feeling."And when it finds one of those phrases,it grabs the sentence up to the period,and then automatically tries to deduce the age, genderand geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.Then, knowing the geographical location and the time,we can also then figure out the weatherwhen that person wrote the sentence.All of this information is saved in a databasethat collects about 20,000 feelings a day.It's been running for about a year and a half.It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.And I'll show you a glimpseof how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine.What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles,each of which represents a single human feelingthat was stated in the last few hours.The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside --so that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.And sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.The diameter of each dotrepresents the length of the sentence inside,so that the large dots contain large sentences,and the small dots contain small sentences.Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here,"I would just feel so much betterif I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for mein the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips."So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimesin the world of human emotions.And all of these are stated by people:"I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much,but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond,it's nice to feel bigger again."The dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics,and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.And then they also exhibit curiosity.You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.You can see some other onesare swarming around the bottom left corner of the screenaround six words. Those six words represent the six movementsof We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness.There's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.And I'll walk you through a few of those now.Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order,they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings."I feel a bit better now."(Laughter)"I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do.""I feel gypped out of something awesome here.""I feel so free; I feel so good.""I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of."And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blogfrom which it was collected. And in that way,you can connect with the authors of these statementsif you feel some degree of empathy.The next movement is called Montage.Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographsto become extracted and display themselves in a grid.This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelingsin the last few hours, if you will.Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.We see, "I just feel like I'm not going to have funif it's not the both of us." That was from someone in Michigan.We see, "I feel like I have been at a computer all day."(Laughter)These are automatically constructed using the found objects:"I think I feel a little full."The next movement is called mobs.Mobs provides different statistical breakdownsof the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.We see that "better" is the most frequent feeling right now,followed by "good," "bad," "guilty," "right," "down," "sick" and so on.We can also get a gender breakdown.And we see that women are slightly more prolifictalking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.We can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogramof the world's emotional distribution by age.We see people in their twenties are the most prolific,followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties,and it dies out very quickly from there.In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristicsof the weather that they represent,so that the ones collected on a sunny dayswirl around as if they're part of the sun.The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm,and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their positionson a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.Metrics provides more numerical views on the data.We see that the world is feeling "used"at 3.3 times the normal level right now.(Laughter)They're feeling "warm" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.Other views are also available.Here are gender, age, weather, location.The final movement is called Mounds.It's a bit different from the others.Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobswhich kind of jiggle.And if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.We see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad."And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll,and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.You can see the little pink cursor moving along,representing our position.Here we see people that feel "slipping," "nauseous," "responsible."There's also a search capability,if you're interested in finding out about a certain population.For instance, you could find women who feel "addicted"in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.(Laughter)But I'll spare you that.So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected:"I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me.""I feel very lonely.""I need to be in some backwoods redneck townso that I can feel beautiful.""I feel invisible to you.""I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to.""I feel in love with Carolyn." "I feel so naughty.""I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life."(Laughter)"I love how I feel today."So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a techniquethat I call "passive observation."What I mean by that is that it passively observes peopleas they live their lives. It scans the world's blogsand looks at what people are writing,and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.And because of that,you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responsesthat are often very moving.And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my workbecause people don't know they're being interviewed.They're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.Another technique is directly questioning people.And this is a technique that I explored in a different project,the Yahoo! Time Capsule,which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.It was divided into ten very simple themes --love, anger, sadness and so on --each of which contained a single, very open-ended questionput to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.The time capsule was available for one month online,translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.It's a spinning globe,the surface of which is entirely composed of the picturesand words and drawings of peoplethat submitted to the time capsule.The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.This is in response to, What's beautiful? "Miss World."There are two modes to the time capsule.There's One World, which presents the spinning globe,and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film stripsand lets you sift through them one by one.So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event,which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexicoat the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights,the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sidesof the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls,which stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.And we also projected the contents of the time capsuleas binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.You can see the orange line leaving the desert floorat about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazingbecause the first night I looked at all this informationand really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier --the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more,and saw these images go across the rocks,I realized I was seeing the same archetypal eventsdepicted again and again and again.You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss,the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture.And it was really moving. And this picture here was takenthe final night from a distant cliff about two miles away,where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.And there was something very movingabout all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky,and how humans have always used the night skyto project their great stories.You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up,I would often look up into the dark skyand see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.And as an adult, I've been more awareof the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.You know, Orion facing the roaring bull.Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.And it caused me to wonder about our world today.And it caused me to wonder specifically,if we could make new constellations today,what would those look like? What would those be?If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?What are the great stories of today?And those are the questions that inspired my new project,which is debuting here today at TED.Nobody's seen this yet, publicly.It's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.So, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.So, Universe will open here.And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field,and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background,kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealiscan be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom,and we'll put it down here to red.So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along.Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.Each of those stars actually representsa specific event in the real world --a quote that was stated by somebody, an image,a news story, a person, a company. You know,some kind of heroic personality.And you might notice that as the cursor beginsto touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.We see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.And we see here a photograph with a head.You can start to see words emerging here.And those arethe constellations of today.And I can turn them all on,and you can see them moving across the sky now.This is the universe of 2007, the last two months.The data from this is global news coveragefrom thousands of news sources around the world.It's using the API of a really great company that I work within New York, actually, called Daylife.And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this levelof the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.So we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford,Iraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words --I call them secrets -- and we can cause them to forman alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smithplaying a big role recently.President Ford -- this is Gerald Ford's funeral.We can actually click anything in Universeand have it become the center of the universe,and everything else will enter its orbit.So, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center.And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbitand swirl around it.We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.We can click on one of thoseand have the photograph be the center of the universe.Now the things that relate to it are swirling around.We can click on this and we see this iconic imageof Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin.In Universe, there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely,and you can just kind of click on stuff.This is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.So, if we want to,let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.And let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrainedto all things Bill Clinton.We can have his constellations emerge here.We can pull out his secrets,and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates,Hillary, presidential, Barack Obama.We can see the storiesthat Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.Any of those can be opened up.So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.You can see that this is an important story;there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up,we get different perspectives on this story.You can click any of those to go out and read the articleat the source. This one's from Al Jazeera.We can also see the superstars. These would be the peoplethat are kind of the looming heroes and heroinesin the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary,Iraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby --these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reachof Bill Clinton in the last week or so.We can see he's been focused in Americabecause he's been campaigning, probably,but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.And then we can also see a timeline.So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday,but he was back to work on Sunday morning,and actually been tapering off since then this week.And it's not limited to just people or dates,but we can actually put in concepts also.So if I put in climate change for all of 2006,we'll see what that universe looks like.Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes.Here we have our secrets.So we see again, climate change is large:Nairobi, global conference, environmental.And there are also quotes that you can see,if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.You know, this is really an infinite thing.The superstars of climate change in 2006:United States, Britain, China. You know,these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.So this is a piece that demands exploration.This will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explorewhat your own personal mythology might be.You'll notice that in Daylife -- rather, in Universe --it supports both the notion of a global mythology,which is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007,and also a personal mythology.As you search for the things that are important to you in your world,and then see what the constellations of those might look like.So it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.(Applause)

That was from someone in Michigan.We see, "I feel like I have been at a computer all day."(Laughter)These are automatically constructed using the found objects:"I think I feel a little full."The next movement is called mobs.Mobs provides different statistical breakdownsof the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.We see that "better" is the most frequent feeling right now,followed by "good," "bad," "guilty," "right," "down," "sick" and so on.We can also get a gender breakdown.And we see that women are slightly more prolifictalking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.We can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogramof the world's emotional distribution by age.We see people in their twenties are the most prolific,followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties,and it dies out very quickly from there.In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristicsof the weather that they represent,so that the ones collected on a sunny dayswirl around as if they're part of the sun.The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm,and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their positionson a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.Metrics provides more numerical views on the data.We see that the world is feeling "used"at 3.3 times the normal level right now.(Laughter)They're feeling "warm" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.Other views are also available.Here are gender, age, weather, location.The final movement is called Mounds.It's a bit different from the others.Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobswhich kind of jiggle.And if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.We see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad."And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll,and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.You can see the little pink cursor moving along,representing our position.Here we see people that feel "slipping," "nauseous," "responsible."There's also a search capability,if you're interested in finding out about a certain population.For instance, you could find women who feel "addicted"in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.(Laughter)But I'll spare you that.So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected:"I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me.""I feel very lonely.""I need to be in some backwoods redneck townso that I can feel beautiful.""I feel invisible to you.""I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to.""I feel in love with Carolyn." "I feel so naughty.""I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life."(Laughter)"I love how I feel today."So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a techniquethat I call "passive observation."What I mean by that is that it passively observes peopleas they live their lives. It scans the world's blogsand looks at what people are writing,and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.And because of that,you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responsesthat are often very moving.And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my workbecause people don't know they're being interviewed.They're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.Another technique is directly questioning people.And this is a technique that I explored in a different project,the Yahoo! Time Capsule,which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.It was divided into ten very simple themes --love, anger, sadness and so on --each of which contained a single, very open-ended questionput to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.The time capsule was available for one month online,translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.It's a spinning globe,the surface of which is entirely composed of the picturesand words and drawings of peoplethat submitted to the time capsule.The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.This is in response to, What's beautiful? "Miss World."There are two modes to the time capsule.There's One World, which presents the spinning globe,and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film stripsand lets you sift through them one by one.So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event,which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexicoat the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights,the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sidesof the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls,which stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.And we also projected the contents of the time capsuleas binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.You can see the orange line leaving the desert floorat about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazingbecause the first night I looked at all this informationand really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier --the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more,and saw these images go across the rocks,I realized I was seeing the same archetypal eventsdepicted again and again and again.You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss,the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture.And it was really moving. And this picture here was takenthe final night from a distant cliff about two miles away,where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.And there was something very movingabout all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky,and how humans have always used the night skyto project their great stories.You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up,I would often look up into the dark skyand see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.And as an adult, I've been more awareof the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.You know, Orion facing the roaring bull.Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.And it caused me to wonder about our world today.And it caused me to wonder specifically,if we could make new constellations today,what would those look like? What would those be?If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?What are the great stories of today?And those are the questions that inspired my new project,which is debuting here today at TED.Nobody's seen this yet, publicly.It's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.So, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.So, Universe will open here.And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field,and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background,kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealiscan be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom,and we'll put it down here to red.So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along.Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.Each of those stars actually representsa specific event in the real world --a quote that was stated by somebody, an image,a news story, a person, a company. You know,some kind of heroic personality.And you might notice that as the cursor beginsto touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.We see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.And we see here a photograph with a head.You can start to see words emerging here.And those arethe constellations of today.And I can turn them all on,and you can see them moving across the sky now.This is the universe of 2007, the last two months.The data from this is global news coveragefrom thousands of news sources around the world.It's using the API of a really great company that I work within New York, actually, called Daylife.And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this levelof the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.So we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford,Iraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words --I call them secrets -- and we can cause them to forman alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smithplaying a big role recently.President Ford -- this is Gerald Ford's funeral.We can actually click anything in Universeand have it become the center of the universe,and everything else will enter its orbit.So, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center.And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbitand swirl around it.We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.We can click on one of thoseand have the photograph be the center of the universe.Now the things that relate to it are swirling around.We can click on this and we see this iconic imageof Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin.In Universe, there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely,and you can just kind of click on stuff.This is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.So, if we want to,let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.And let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrainedto all things Bill Clinton.We can have his constellations emerge here.We can pull out his secrets,and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates,Hillary, presidential, Barack Obama.We can see the storiesthat Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.Any of those can be opened up.So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.You can see that this is an important story;there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up,we get different perspectives on this story.You can click any of those to go out and read the articleat the source. This one's from Al Jazeera.We can also see the superstars. These would be the peoplethat are kind of the looming heroes and heroinesin the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary,Iraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby --these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reachof Bill Clinton in the last week or so.We can see he's been focused in Americabecause he's been campaigning, probably,but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.And then we can also see a timeline.So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday,but he was back to work on Sunday morning,and actually been tapering off since then this week.And it's not limited to just people or dates,but we can actually put in concepts also.So if I put in climate change for all of 2006,we'll see what that universe looks like.Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes.Here we have our secrets.So we see again, climate change is large:Nairobi, global conference, environmental.And there are also quotes that you can see,if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.You know, this is really an infinite thing.The superstars of climate change in 2006:United States, Britain, China. You know,these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.So this is a piece that demands exploration.This will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explorewhat your own personal mythology might be.You'll notice that in Daylife -- rather, in Universe --it supports both the notion of a global mythology,which is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007,and also a personal mythology.As you search for the things that are important to you in your world,and then see what the constellations of those might look like.So it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.(Applause)

I'd like to speak about technology trends,which is something that many of you follow --but we also follow, for related reasons.Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trendsare something that we write about and need to know about.But also it's part of being any monthly magazine --you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.We have to plan issues many months in advance;we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.We also, like a lot of companies, create a productthat's based on technology trends.In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky,some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.And so we have to understandnot only why tech's important, where it's going,but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions madeduring the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce,or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising,they were all right -- they were just wrong in time.Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuationsis obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.You've probably seen something like this before.This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks aboutkind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it,to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,or whether they were about to crashinto the trough of disillusionment,or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a senseof where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important;we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that,we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologiesare going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.And then it's time to do it again. Last year.And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trendsthat I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future,"but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.It's based on the presumption, the observation even,that all important technologies go through four stages in their life --at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision --a collision with something else --for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technologyand also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.And these are the inflection points that tell youwhat the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,and maybe how you can do something about it.The first is the critical price.The first stage in a technology's advanceis that it'll fall below a critical price.After it falls below a critical price, it will tend,if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology,and that's another important point.And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it;it's an opportunity for the technology to change.And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi --you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass,but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet --there's still more opportunity in that.I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by thisby telling the story of the DVD,which is a technology which has done all of these.The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990sand it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998,it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.And it started to take off. And you can see that the unitsstarted to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case,20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.And what's interesting hereis that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.Suddenly you have a DVD in the house;you've got high-quality digital video;you have a reason to have a big-screen television;you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them,and bring the rest of your entertainment in.What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment,that was an inflection point that he could do something with.The next phase it hit was displacement.You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVDin a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small;you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.That gave an advantage; that was an implicationof the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.And then finally, DVDs are approaching free.There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm,who has, several times in the past year, been the number-oneDVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.You're aware of theperhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampedeover the 30-dollar DVD.But they're getting very, very cheap,and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper,the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share,and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.They're being commodified, and that's what happenswhen things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.(Laughter)Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology,these four stages of technology's life.I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there,just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens,these four, as a way to kind of tell youwhere each one of those technologies is in its development.They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there --they're just examples of technologiesthat are in each one of these periods.But I think that the implications of them approachingthese crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.Start with gene sequencing.As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part,because it's built on computers -- is falling in priceat a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.It is now possible -- will be possible,and if Craig Venter indeed comes today,he may tell you something about this --to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.You know, our ability to capture the tools of creationis getting closer and closer.What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genesthat we're discovering is rising very quickly.Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.There will come a daywhen you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply,if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price.This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effectof generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere,and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.Today it's less than 50 cents a day.And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity,if you look at the correlation between these two,as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treatgoes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHObelieve that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 --two million in sub-Saharan Africa.And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.Linux is another good example.Now we've switched to critical mass.These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.Interestingly, it's done a crossover before,but not the crossovers that matter.The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.But you can look and see the direction those lines are going,you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.It's not just for the geeks any more.That is, I imagine, what people in Redmondwake up in the middle of the night thinking about.(Laughter)Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 --and I don't think this is a crazy forecast --they'll be two percent of auto sales.Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business,which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.And what's interesting about the hybrids taking offis you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.And once you have electric motors, you can do anything:you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire;you can have replaceable body shapes --it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid,but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere;it's a little hard to use right now.There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year;they already have nearly four million registered users --that's critical mass.And the same thing's happening on the carrier side.You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditionaltelecom standards. This is a tipping point --if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics,and the speed, and the players in the industry.It's going to look a little bit like that.And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.Free is something that comes with digital, becausethe reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP,because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics,because there's so much bandwidth.Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.It's an economic force; it's a technical force.It's a deflationary force, if not handled right.It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.Free is probably the most interesting thing.And here you have just the number of songsthat can be stored on a hard drive.You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there,but it's basically, every song ever made could be storedon 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element,the physical element, of songs off the table.And you've seen the numbers.I mean, you know, the music industry is implodingin front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.They're facing a force that they haven't faced before.And their response is draconian, and not necessarilythe one that's going to get them out of this.And finally, I'll give you one last example of free --perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics --their abundance tends to make things free.This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.And what's interesting is that it was just 1990when it was more than two dollars a minute.India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly,but then there was just so much fiber out there,you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.It's seven cents a minute, in many cases.And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling,to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalizationand one of the most powerful economic toolsthat we're seeing in our world today.The force of India, and then China, and any other countrythat can contact our marketsand will work with our companies -- because the communications are free --is just beginning to be felt.And I think that's probably oneof the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.Thank you.

Mockingbirds are badass.(Laughter)They are.Mockingbirds -- that's Mimus polyglottos --are the emcees of the animal kingdom.They listen and mimic and remix what they like.They rock the mic outside my window every morning.I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarmslike they were songs of spring.I mean, if you can talk it, a mockingbird can squawk it.So check it, I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds.I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nationand put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails.(Laughter)Yeah. And as I drive through a neighborhood,say, where people got-a-lotta, I'll take a mockingbird I caughtin a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go, you know.Up goes the bird, out come the words, "Juanito, Juanito,vente a comer mi hijo!"Oh, I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound.(Laughter)Cruising random city streets, rocking a drop-top Cadillacwith a big backseat, packing like 13 brown paper Walmart bagsfull of loaded mockingbirds, and I'll get everybody.(Laughter)I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying,"We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis."I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is.I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is.I'll get your postman making dinner plans.I'll get the last time you lied.I'll get, "Baby, just give me the frickin' TV guide."I'll get a lonely, little sentence with real error in it,"Yeah, I guess I could come inside, but only for a minute."(Laughter)I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning "It's Raining, It's Pouring."I'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring.I'll get your ex-lover telling someone else, "Good morning."I'll get everyone's good mornings.I don't care how you make 'em.Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah-Salam Alaikum.Everybody means everybody, means everybody here.And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage.I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages.Inside it, I will place a mockingbird for --short explanation, hippie parents.(Laughter)What does a violin have to do with technology?Where in the world is this world heading?On one end, gold bars --on the other, an entire planet.We are 12 billion light years from the edge.That's a guess.Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely,but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in Americabecause countries are beginning to eat like us, live like us and die like us.You might wanna avert your gaze, because thatis a newt about to regenerate its limb,and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing.There's about 10 million phage per job.It's a very strange world inside a nanotube.Women can talk; black men ski; white men build strong buildings;we build strong suns.The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes,and here we are, right in the middle.(Laughter)It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn.When all the little mockingbirds fly away,they're going to sound like the last four days.I will get uptown gurus, downtown teachers,broke-ass artists and dealers, and Filipino preachers, leaf blowers,bartenders, boob-job doctors, hooligans, garbage men,your local Congressmen in the spotlight, guys in the overhead helicopters.Everybody gets heard.Everybody gets this one, honest mockingbird as a witness.And I'm on this.I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads,with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bedsinging, "Hush, little baby, don't say a word.Wait for the man with the mockingbird."(Laughter)Yeah. And then come the news crews, andthe man-in-the-street interviews, and the letters to the editor.Everybody asking, just who is responsible for this citywide,nationwide mockingbird cacophony, and somebody finally is going to tipthe City Council of Monterey, California off to me,and they'll offer me a key to the city.A gold-plated, oversized key to the cityand that is all I need, 'cause if I get that, I can unlock the air.I'll listen for what's missing, and I'll put it there.Thank you, TED.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Wow.(Applause)Wow.(Applause)

I'm not quite sure whether I really want to seea snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning.But anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater,and really I must thank Herbie Hancockand his colleagues for such a great presentation. (Applause)One of the interesting things,of course, is the combination of that raw hand on the instrumentand technology, and of course what he said about listening to our young people.Of course, my job is all about listening,and my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen.That's my only real aim in life.And it sounds quite simple, but actually it's quite a big, big job.Because you know, when you look at a piece of music -- for example,if I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here, hopefully,a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page.And, you know, we open it up and I read the music.So technically, I can actually read this.I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics.I will do exactly as I'm told.And so therefore, because time is short,if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so. It's very straightforward.There's nothing too difficult about the piece.But here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick.I'm being told where to play on the drum.I'm being told which part of the stick to use.And I'm being told the dynamic.And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares.Snares on, snares off.So therefore, if I translate this piece of music, we have this idea. (Music)And so on. My career would probably last about five years.However, what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music.Everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher,or to talk about, even, from a teacher.But it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrumentthat in fact become so interesting, and that you want to explorethrough this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.So there, we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation. (Music) (Applause)Now my career may last a little longer!But in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you and I seea nice bright young lady with a pink top on.I see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc.So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about, what you might like,what you might do as a profession, etc., etc.However, that's just, you know, the initial idea I may have that we all getwhen we actually look, and we try to interpret,but actually it's so unbelievably shallow.In the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea;I wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do.Just the basic feeling.However, that is simply not enough.And I think what Herbie said -- please listen, listen.We have to listen to ourselves, first of all.If I play, for example, holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick --you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm.And you feel really quite -- believe it or not --detached from the instrument and from the stick,even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached.If I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system,suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more.And I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum.And I'm doing far, far less.So in the same way that I need time with this instrument,I need time with people in order to interpret them.Not just translate them, but interpret them.If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of musicfor which I think of myself as a technician --that is, someone who is basically a percussion player ... (Music)And so on. If I think of myself as a musician ... (Music)And so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- (Applause)-- thinking about.And I remember when I was 12 years old,and I started playing tympani and percussion, and my teacher said,"Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening."And I said, "Yes, I agree with that. So what's the problem?"And he said, "Well, how are you going to hear this? How are you going to hear that?"And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?"He said, "Well, I think I hear it through here."And I said, "Well, I think I do too -- but I also hear it through my hands,through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on."And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums --in particular, the kettle drums, or tympani --to such a narrow pitch interval, so something like ...that of a difference. Then gradually ... and gradually ...and it's amazing that when you do open your body up,and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through,that in fact the tiny, tiny difference ...can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there.And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wallof the music room, and together we would "listen" to the sounds of the instruments,and really try to connect with those soundsfar, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear.Because of course, the ear is, I mean, subject to all sorts of things.The room we happen to be in, the amplification, the quality of the instrument,the type of sticks ... etc., etc.They're all different.Same amount of weight, but different sound colors.And that's basically what we are. We're just human beings,but we all have our own little sound colors, as it were,that make up these extraordinary personalitiesand characters and interests and things.And as I grew older, I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London,and they said, "Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue,you know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf' musician."And I just couldn't quite accept that.And so therefore, I said to them, "Well, look, if you refuse --if you refuse me through those reasons,as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and lovethe art of creating sound --then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."And as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice --they accepted me. And not only that --what had happened was that it changed the whole roleof the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom.Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis ofwhether someone had no arms, no legs --they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand.No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry.And every single entry had to be listened to, experienced and thenbased on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not.So therefore, this in turn meant that there was an extremely interestingbunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions.And I have to say, many of them nowin the professional orchestras throughout the world.The interesting thing about this as well, though --(Applause) --is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound --which is basically all of us, and we well know that music really is our daily medicine.I say "music," but actually I mean "sound."Because you know, some of the extraordinary things I've experiencedas a musician, when you may have a 15-year-old ladwho has got the most incredible challenges,who may not be able to control his movements,who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. --suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument,and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba,and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost --I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps --but something like this. Let me change. (Music)Something that's so unbelievably simple --but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be,because I'm on top of the sound.I have the sound coming this way.He would have the sound coming through the resonators.If there were no resonators on here, we would have ... (Music)So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rowswouldn't experience, those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience either.Every single one of us, depending on where we're sitting,will experience this sound quite, quite differently.And of course, being the participator of the sound,and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce --for example, this sound.Can you hear anything?Exactly. Because I'm not even touching it.But yet, we get the sensation of something happening.In the same way that when I see tree moves,then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound.Do you see what I mean?Whatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening.So there's always, always that huge --I mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from.So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience,and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it,buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth.Because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic,and something that I can fully experience the journey of.So it may be that, in certain halls, this dynamic may well work. (Music)It may be that in other halls, they're simply not going to experience thatat all and so therefore, my level of soft,gentle playing may have to be ... (Music)Do you see what I mean? So, because of this explosion in access to sound,especially through the deaf community,this has not only affected how music institutions,how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy --although of course, being a participator of music,that definitely is the case as well.But it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of hallsthey put together. There are so few halls in this worldthat actually have very good acoustics,dare I say. But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine.The tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad,so huge, so incredible! There's always something --it may sound good up there, may not be so good there.May be great there, but terrible up there.Maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc.So to find an actual hall is incredible-- for which you can play exactly what you imagine,without it being cosmetically enhanced.And so therefore, acousticians are actually in conversation with people who arehearing impaired, and who are participators of sound.And this is quite interesting.I cannot, you know, give you any detail as far as what is actually happeningwith those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of peoplefor whom so many years we've been saying,"Well, how on Earth can they experience music? You know, they're deaf."We just -- we go like that, and we imagine that that's what deafness is about.Or we go like that, and we imagine that's what blindness is about.If we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk.It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. That, to them, means they can walk.In a year's time, it could be two extra steps.In another year's time, three extra steps.Those are hugely important aspects to think about.So when we do listen to each other,it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills,to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber, to stop the judgment.For me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music,it's very easy for me to say, "Oh yes, I like that piece.Oh no, I don't like that piece." And so on.And you know, I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time.It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music,but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music.And you know, it's just one of the great things about being a musician,is that it is so unbelievably fluid.So there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way.If I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this.If I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder."I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder.Now, I don't mean just the sound;I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves.And please try to create that through your clapping. Try. Just -- please try.(Applause)Very good! Snow. Snow. Have you ever heard snow?Audience: No.Evelyn Glennie: Well then, stop clapping. (Laughter) Try again.Try again. Snow.See, you're awake.Rain. Not bad. Not bad.You know, the interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kidsnot so long ago exactly the same question.Now -- great imagination, thank you very much.However, not one of you got out of your seats to think,"Right! How can I clap? OK, maybe ... (Claps)Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds.Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds."Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different wayother than sitting in your seats there and using two hands.In the same way that when we listen to music,we assume that it's all being fed through here.This is how we experience music. Of course it's not.We experience thunder -- thunder, thunder. Think, think, think.Listen, listen, listen. Now -- what can we do with thunder?I remember my teacher. When I first started, my very first lesson,I was all prepared with sticks, ready to go.And instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart,arms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle, sticks in a more-or-less V shape,keep this amount of space here, etc.Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." --where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen,and I would not be able to strike the drum,because I was thinking of so many other things -- he said,"Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I'll see you next week."So, heavens! What was I to do? I no longer required the sticks;I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.I had to basically look at this particular drum,see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did.Turned it upside down, experimented with the shell, experimented with the head.Experimented with my body, experimented with jewelry,experimented with all sorts of things.And of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that --but nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience,because then, where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music?Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book?So we never, ever dealt with actual study books.So for example, one of the things that we learnwhen we are dealing with being a percussion player, as opposed to a musician,is basically straightforward single stroke rolls.Like that. And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster.And so on and so forth. What does this piece require?Single stroke rolls. So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music?And that's exactly what he did.And interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time studentat a so called "music institution," all of that went out of the window.We had to study from study books.And constantly, the question, "Well, why? Why? What is this relating to?I need to play a piece of music." "Oh, well, this will help your control!""Well, how? Why do I need to learn that? I need to relate it to a piece of music.You know. I need to say something."Why am I practicing paradiddles?Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? Why am I doing that?I need to have the reason,and the reason has to be by saying something through the music."And by saying something through music, which basically is sound,we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people.But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage.That's up to you, when you walk through a hall.Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things.I may feel sorrowful, or happy, or exhilarated, or angry when I playcertain pieces of music, but I'm not necessarilywanting you to feel exactly the same thing.So please, the next time you go to a concert,just allow your body to open up, allow your body to be this resonating chamber.Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is.The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound,because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum,or the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc.,or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass.They're experiencing that rawness there.But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure,which is before the sound is actually happening.Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike,or breath, is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that soundin the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journeyof this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night.But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses.But thank you very much for having me!(Applause)

So I'm going to speak about a problem that I haveand that's that I'm a philosopher.(Laughter)When I go to a party and people ask me what do I doand I say, "I'm a professor," their eyes glaze over.When I go to an academic cocktail partyand there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm inand I say, "philosophy" -- their eyes glaze over.(Laughter)When I go to a philosopher's party(Laughter)and they ask me what I work on and I say, "consciousness,"their eyes don't glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl.(Laughter)And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growlsbecause they think, "That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness."The very chutzpah of somebody thinkingthat you could explain consciousness is just out of the question.My late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher,in one of his books, "Philosophical Explanations,"is commenting on the ethos of philosophy --the way philosophers go about their business.And he says, you know, "Philosophers love rational argument."And he says, "It seems as if the ideal argumentfor most philosophers is you give your audience the premisesand then you give them the inferences and the conclusion,and if they don't accept the conclusion, they die.Their heads explode." The idea is to have an argumentthat is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all.It's very hard to change people's mindsabout something like consciousness,and I finally figured out the reason for that.The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness.We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games.They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts.But they don't consider themselves experts on video games;they've just got strong opinions.I'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate changeand global warming, or on the future of the Internet,encounter people who have very strong opinionsabout what's going to happen next.But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise.They're just strongly held opinions.But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think,each of us seems to think, "I am an expert.Simply by being conscious, I know all about this."And so, you tell them your theory and they say,"No, no, that's not the way consciousness is!No, you've got it all wrong."And they say this with an amazing confidence.And so what I'm going to try to do todayis to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling --I can feel it myself.I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds --that you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness.That's the order of the day here.Now, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble.I think everybody understands what that means.That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.It's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover.And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque.That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle,Suzanne R. -- he's off to the races.There's a wonderful stream of consciousness hereand if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man.What I particularly like about this picture, too,is that Steinberg has rendered the guyin this sort of pointillist style.Which reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday:what we are, what each of us is -- what you are, what I am --is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots.That's what we're made of.No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them.Not a single one of those cells is conscious;not a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares.Somehow, we have to explainhow when you put together teams, armies, battalionsof hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells --not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them --the result is this. I mean, just look at it.The content -- there's color, there's ideas, there's memories,there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousnessis accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons.How is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all.They think, "No, there can't be anysort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness."This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel,who's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii,and he's an expert magician, and an experton the street magic of India, which is what this book is about,"Net of Magic."And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you.It speaks so eloquently to the problem."'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?'By 'real magic,' people mean miracles,thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers.'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.''Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real;while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic."(Laughter)Now, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness.(Laughter)Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks.If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks,then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.And, as Marvin said, and as other people have said,"Consciousness is a bag of tricks."This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfiedand incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness.So this is the problem. So I have todo a little bit of the sort of workthat a lot of you won't like,for the same reason that you don't like to seea magic trick explained to you.How many of you here, if somebody -- some smart aleck --starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done,you sort of want to block your ears and say, "No, no, I don't want to know!Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified.Don't tell me the answer."A lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered.And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you.You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks.But I'm not going to explain it all to you.I'm going to do what philosophers do.Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick.You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick?The philosopher says, "I'm going to explain to you how that's done.You see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half."(Laughter)"He merely makes you think that he does."And you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?"He says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry."(Laughter)So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness.But I'm going to try to also show youthat consciousness isn't quite as marvelous --your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful --as you may have thought it is.This is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book.He marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwardspeople will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things.He didn't even try to do those things.People's memories inflate what they think they saw.And the same is true of consciousness.Now, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this.Watch it carefully.I'm working with a young computer-animator documentariannamed Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me,part of a larger project some of you may be interested in.We're looking for a backer.It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness.OK, now, you all saw what changed, right?How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color?Every one. I'll just show you by running it again.Even when you know that they're all going to change color,it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrateto pick up any of the changes at all.Now, this is an example -- one of many --of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit.It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my1991 book, "Consciousness Explained,"where I said if you did experiments of this sort,you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.If there's time at the end,I'll show you the much more dramatic case.Now, how can it be that there are all those changes going on,and that we're not aware of them?Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades,the way your eye moves around three or four times a second.He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion,moving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows,looking at interesting things in the world.And where your eye isn't looking,you're remarkably impoverished in your vision.That's because the foveal part of your eye,which is the high-resolution part,is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length.That's the detail part.It doesn't seem that way, does it?It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is.You're getting in a lot less information than you think.Here's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto.It's in the museum in North Carolina.Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's.And I love paintings like that --the painting is actually about as big as it is right here.And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail,and you can get right upand see all the details on the painting.And I started across the hall in North Carolina,because I thought it was probably a Canaletto,and would have all that in detail.And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people --you can just barely see them walking across the bridge.And I thought as I got closerI would be able to see all the detail of most people,see their clothes, and so forth.And as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed.I yelled out because when I got closer,I found the detail wasn't there at all.There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint.And as I walked towards the picture,I was expecting detail that wasn't there.The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothesand wagons and all sorts of things,and my brain had taken the suggestion.You're familiar with a more recent technology, which is -- There,you can get a better view of the blobs.See, when you get closethey're really just blobs of paint.You will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect.I'll just give that to you one more time.Now, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion?When an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist,suggests a person -- say, one ofMarvin Minsky's little society of mind --do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere?I don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done?Well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?It's the same thing.The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there.You think the detail's there, but it isn't there.The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all.It's just making you expect the detail.Let's just do this experiment very quickly.Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated?Yes.How many of you did it by rotating the one on the leftin your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right?How many of you rotated the one on the right? OK.How do you know that's what you did?(Laughter)There's in fact been a very interesting debateraging for over 20 years in cognitive science --various experiments started by Roger Shepherd,who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images.Yes, it's possible to do that.But the details of the process are still in significant controversy.And if you read that literature, one of the thingsthat you really have to come to terms with iseven when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know.You don't know how you do it.You just know that you have certain beliefs.And they come in a certain order, at a certain time.And what explains the fact that that's what you think?Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician.This is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais.You may think that I've cheated,that I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there.How many of you see that sort of boundary,with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles?Can you see it?Well, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense.Your brain is actually computing that boundary,the boundary that goes right there.But now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right?It's a Necker cube.Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK.Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube?Because there's another way of seeing it.If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles,some black circles, there's another way of seeing it.As a cube, on a black background,as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese.(Laughter)Can you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help.(Laughter)Now you can get it. These are two very different phenomena.When you see the cube one way, behind the screen,those boundaries go away.But there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this.We don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change?Does your brain have to send little painters in there?The purple-painters and the green-paintersfight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No.Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in.When I first started talking aboutthe Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw --I'll go back to it, this one --I said that there was no filling-in behind there.And I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true.But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't.Now, if you think you see some pale yellow --I'll run this a few more times.Look in the gray areas,and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there --yeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.["Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes" slide]This is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degreeinspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book.Let me just pause this for a second if I can.This is change-blindness.What you're going to see is two pictures,one of which is slightly different from the other.You see here the red roof and the gray roof,and in between them there will be a mask,which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second.So you'll see the first picture, then a mask,then the second picture, then a mask.And this will just continue, and your job as the subjectis to press the button when you see the change.So, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.And keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying,"I see the change."So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment.We're going to start easy. Some examples.No trouble there.Can everybody see? All right.Indeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit morethan a second to press the button.Can you see that one?2.9 seconds.How many don't see it still?What's on the roof of that barn?(Laughter)It's easy.Is it a bridge or a dock?There are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close.I want you to see a few that are particularly striking.This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see.Can you see it?Audience: Yes.Dan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth? Pretty big.So 15.5 seconds is the median timefor subjects in his experiment there.I love this one. I'll end with this one,just because it's such an obvious and important thing.How many still don't see it? How many still don't see it?How many engines on the wing of that Boeing?(Laughter)Right in the middle of the picture!Thanks very much for your attention.What I wanted to show you is that scientists,using their from-the-outside, third-person methods,can tell you things about your own consciousnessthat you would never dream of,and that, in fact, you're not the authorityon your own consciousness that you think you are.And we're really making a lot of progresson coming up with a theory of mind.Jeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attemptto get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience.And he's right. This is a problem.Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk --director of the lab said, "In our lab, we have a saying.If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience.If you work on two neurons, that's psychology."(Laughter)We have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down.Thank you very much.(Applause)

Thank you very much.Now, I've got a story for you.When I arrived off the plane,after a very long journey from the West of England,my computer, my beloved laptop,had gone mad,and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! --and the display on it --anyway, the whole thing had burst.And I went to the IT guys hereand a gentleman mended my computer,and then he said, "What are you doing here?"and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing,"and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well."And I said, "Do you really?"Anyway, so you're in for a treat,because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark.(Applause)I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby.(Applause)This song is called "Farther than the Sun."(Music)♫ Strung in the wind I called you ♫♫ but you did not hear ... ♫♫ And you're a plant that needs poor soil ♫♫ and I have treated you too well ♫♫ to give up flowers ... ♫♫ Oh, I have been too rich for you ... ♫♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ You are not worthy ... ♫♫ With your calculating eyes ♫♫ spinning figures ♫♫ you cannot see me ♫♫ You cannot see me ... ♫♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫♫ I'll believe it ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ The sea, it freezes over ... ♫♫ to trap the light ♫♫ And I'm in love with being in love ♫♫ and you were never quite the one ♫♫ In Gerda's eyes ♫♫ Fragments of what you've become ♫♫ And all the moths that fly at night ♫♫ believe electric light is bright ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ With your calculating eyes ♫♫ Spinning figures ♫♫ You cannot see me, no ♫♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫♫ I'll believe it ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ With your calculating eyes ♫♫ Spinning figures ♫♫ You cannot see me, no ... ♫♫ And if I tell myself enough, I'll believe it ♫(Applause)Thank you very much.

Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories,only to find out that you're a performance artist.(Laughter)I'm also a software engineer,and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer.And I think the main thing that I'm interested inis trying to find a way ofmaking the computer into a personal mode of expression.And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft,and in a way those are my bane:I think there's a great homogenizing forcethat software imposes on people and limits the way they thinkabout what's possible on the computer.Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible,you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on.But, in a way, the computer makes possible much morethan what most people think, and my art has just been abouttrying to find a personal way of using the computer,and so I end up writing software to do that.Chris has asked me to do a short performance,and so I'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes --to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a momentto show you a couple of my other projects in video form.Thank you.(Applause)We've got about a minute left.I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project.I did a performance with two singerswho specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica;we repeated it in England.And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind themwith a large screen.We used a computer vision tracking systemin order to know where they were.And since we know where their heads are,and we have a wireless mic on themthat we're processing the sound from,we're able to create visualizationswhich are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech.This will take about 30 seconds or so.He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound.Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it.Thanks very much. There's always lots more.I'm overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York,you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week,and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.And with that, I think I should give up the stage,so, thank you so much.

So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl,"If you say a word often enough, it becomes you."And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland,I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder --thank God for technology --to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words --which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform --if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.I was also inspired by Walt Whitman,who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.So these four characters are going to be from that workthat I've been doing for many years now,and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand peopleI've interviewed.Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?So I thought he would be the perfect personto go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.You know, he was "born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank,greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg,and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century."(Laughter)So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history."Defining moment in American history, I don't think there's one;you can't say Hiroshima, that's a big one --I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.The gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the wordused by the people in Watergate, moral slippage --it's a gradual kind of thing, combination of things.You see, we also have the technology.I say, less and less the human touch."Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit.The Atlanta airport is a modern airport,and they should leave the gate there.These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.And these trains are smooth,and they're quiet and they're efficient.And there's a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice.You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.Now we have humans imitating robots.So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush inand they're just about to close the pneumatic doors.And that voice, without losing a beat, says,'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.'Just then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyesand the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking.Well, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding --I do that to steel my nerves -- and soI imitate a train call, holding my hand on my --'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see.Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughswhen I say that, but not on this train. Silence.And so suddenly they're looking at me.So here I am with the couple, the three of usshrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know."Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother.I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion.So I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby,holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof,I say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam,what is your considered opinion of the human species?'And the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly,starts laughing,starts busting out with this crazy little laugh.I say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.'"But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.You know, you see, you've got to question the official truth.You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain --you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him.We read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course.I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.Remember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?You see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling,but there's something in him.And the official truth, the truth was, the law was,that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kidsand steal them from the woman who owns them,and Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh --that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.Ooh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal;he's going to do a terrible thing.'Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.''Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off.And Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh,I did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing -- why do I feel so good?'"But it's the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of,you see, all been buried; it's all been buried.So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.So you ask about a defining moment --ain't no defining moment in American history for me.It's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now,where trivia becomes news.And more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.Huh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not,but I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says,'We're more and more into communicationsand less and less into communication.'Okay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist."And that's Studs Terkel.(Applause)So, talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes.You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable --well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this,I like to inspire people.But since this was called "risk taking,"I'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeablethat one person actually came backstageand told me to take her out of the show she was in.And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk,at a conference like this, as a good thing.But there are certain other connotations to the word "risk,"and the same thing about the word "nature." What is nature?Maxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopherwho's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy --great, big philosophy kind of an organization --I went to her and asked her what are the two thingsthat she doesn't know, that she still wants to know.And she said, "Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtseywhen I see the president of my university.And I still feel as though I've got to get coffeefor my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them."And she said, "And then intellectually,I don't know enough about the negative imagination.And September 11th certainly taught usthat that's a whole area we don't investigate."So this piece is about a negative imagination.It raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is,and about what a risk can be.And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women.Everything I do is word for word off a tape.And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems,and this is called "A Mirror to Her Mouth."And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins."I began to learn how to cover it up,because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.I want everybody to think we were a normal family.I mean we had all the materialistic things,but that didn't make my children pain any less;that didn't make their fears subside.I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyesand busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses.And he beat me too. But that didn't change the factthat it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare.And I failed them dramatically,because I allowed it to go on and on and on."But the night that Myesha got killed --and the intensity just grew and grew and grew,until one night we came home from getting drugs,and he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her,and he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt.He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thingthat Myesha was having sex with her little brotherand they was fondling each other -- that would be his reason.I'm just talking about the particular night that she died.And so he put her in the bathtub,and I was in the bedroom with the baby."And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died,I thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him -- insane --thinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone.And it didn't work, didn't work.And I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic,who was four months old when I came to jail."And I was in the bedroom. Like I said, he had her in the bathroomand he -- he -- every time he hit her, she would fall.And she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly.I could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move.I didn't even go and see what was happening.I just sat there and listened.And then he put her in the hallway.He told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours.And then he told her, get up.And when she got up, she says she couldn't see.Her face was bruised. She had a black eye.All around her head was just swollen;her head was about two sizes of its own size.I told him, 'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep."The next morning she was dead.He went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited.He says, 'She won't breathe.'I knew immediately that she was dead.I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went inand I put a mirror to her mouth --there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth.He said, he said, he said,'We can't, we can't let nobody find out about this.'He say, 'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree."I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years,so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret.So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her,that she was missing.We told a security guard that she was missing,though she wasn't missing.And we told the security guard what we had put on herand we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thingthat we had told the security guard that we had put on her."And then we got the baby and my other child,and we drove out to, like, I-95.I was so petrified and so numb,all I could look was in the rear-view mirror.And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.My own child, I let that happen to."So that's an investigation of the negative imagination.(Applause)When I started this projectcalled "On the Road: A Search For an American Character"with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around Americaand find it in all its aspects -- bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers,drum majorettes -- but I sort of got tripped on race relations,because my first big show was a show about a race riot.And so I went to both -- two race riots,one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that.Because this is what I would sayI've learned the most about race relations, from this piece.It's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happenedbecause four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King.It was captured on videotape -- technology --and it was played all over the world.Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail.They did not, so there were riots.And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial,ordered by George Bush, Sr.And that trial came back with two cops going to jailand two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.And I mean, the people just danced in the streetsbecause they were afraid there was going to be another riot.Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.So there was a community that didn't -- the Korean-Americans,whose stores had been burned to the ground.And so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han,I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.And she asks also a question that Studs talks about:this notion of the "official truth," to question the "official truth."So what she's questioning here, she's taking a chanceand questioning what justice is in society.And this is called, "Swallowing the Bitterness.""I used to believe America was the best.I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.I never saw any poor man, any black.Until 1992, I used to believe America was the best -- I still do;I don't deny that because I am a victim.But at the end of '92, when we were in such turmoil,and having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems,I began to really realize that Koreansare completely left out of this society and we are nothing.Why? Why do we have to be left out?We didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR,no welfare, anything. Many African-Americans who never workgot minimum amount of money to survive.We didn't get any because we have a car and a house.And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice?"OK. OK? OK. OK.Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict,and all the day they were having a party, they celebrated,all of South Central, all the churches. And they say,'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.'Well, what about victims' rights?They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King.He is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson.He is the model of non-violence, non-violence --and they would all like to be in his spirit."But what about 1992? They destroyed innocent people.And I wonder if that is really justicefor them, to get their rights in that way.I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.They became so hilarious, but I was happy for them.I was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK.Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victimswho were destroyed by them.They fought for their rights for over two centuries,and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities,Hispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream.That's why I understand;that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict."But I wish that, I wish that, I wish thatI could be part of the enjoyment.I wish that I could live together with black people.But after the riot, it's too much difference.The fire is still there. How do you say it? [Unclear].Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire.It's still there; it can burst out anytime."Mrs. Young-Soon Han.(Applause)The other reason that I don't wear shoesis just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle upand get into the feet of somebody,walking really in somebody else's shoes.And I told you that in -- you know, I didn't give you the year,but in '79 I thought that I was going to go aroundand find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that,and I got sidetracked on race relations.Finally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago.And I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded.And he's the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican Convention.He's a Republican -- I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway --so this is my dear, dear Brent Williams,and this is on toughness,in case anybody needs to know about being toughfor the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this.And this is called "Toughness.""Well, I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist.I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene,her family's always saying,you know, you ever think he's just a born loser?It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know.But then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know,I didn't lose my kidney -- I could have lost my kidney,I kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser.I think that's good luck.(Laughter)"And, I mean, funny things like this happen.I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan,and there was a Reader's Digest, October 2002.It was like, 'seven ways to get lucky.' And it saysif you want to get lucky,you know, you've got to be around positive people.I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out hereand talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking;she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.'"And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out hereand interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet.She said, 'Look who she is.You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.'(Laughter)And she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiotbecause I've never been to college,and I wouldn't be talking professional or anything.I said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours.You know, if I wasn't talking -- you know,like, you know, she wanted me to talk,I don't think she would even come out here.'"Confidence? Well, I think I ridemore out of determination than confidence.I mean, confidence is like, you know,you've been on that bull before; you know you can ride him.I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.But determination, you know, it's like just, you know, 'Fuck the form,get the horn.'(Laughter)That's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.'I mean, like, Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy,he say, 'You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.'And try and determination is the same thing.Determination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull,even if you're riding upside down.Determination's like, you're going to ridetill your head hits the back of the dirt."Freedom? It would have to be the rodeo."Beauty? I don't think I know what beauty is.Well, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too.I mean, look how we are, the roughy family,palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me.It's like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas.We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat togetherand we sleep together.I mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be likethe last day I rodeo. I mean, I'll be alright.I mean, I have my ranch and everything,but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes.I mean, I guess it just be like --I guess it be like the day my brother died."Toughness? Well, we was in West Jordan, Utah, and this bullshoved my face right through the metal shoots in a --you know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital.And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out.And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night,so I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia,or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up.And then they had to straighten out my nose,and they took these rods and shoved them up my noseand went up through my brainsand felt like it was coming out the top of my head,and everybody said that it should have killed me,but it didn't, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain.(Laughter)But the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up thereand straightened my nose out, I could breathe,and I hadn't been able to breathesince I broke my nose in the high school rodeo."Thank you.(Applause)

cut down to three minutes.seven years ago.and she came from a really poor family.and she asked me a simple little question.She said, "What leads to success?"And I felt really badly,because I couldn't give her a good answer.So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.and pass it on to kids?and makes TEDsters tick.And the first thing is passion.And the interesting thing is:Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!(Laughter)(Laughter)Good!(Applause)and get damn good at it."And it's focus.Norman Jewison said to me,And push!David Gallo says, "Push yourself.I didn't think I'd make it."Now it's not always easy to push yourself,and that's why they invented mothers.(Laughter)(Applause)Frank Gehry said to me,"My mother pushed me."(Laughter)Serve!A lot of kids want to be millionaires.The first thing I say is:"OK, well you can't serve yourself;Ideas!TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea:I'd say it was a pretty good idea.it's just doing some very simple things.And I give lots of evidence.Persist!Joe Kraus says,(Laughter)So, the answer to this question is simple:Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.(Laughter)(Applause)

I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actresstell a very well known interviewer on television,"I'm really getting into the Internet lately.I just wish it were more organized."So ...(Laughter)If I controlled the Internet,you could auction your broken heart on eBay.Take the money; go to Amazon;buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to -- call folks at randomuntil you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language.(Laughter)If I were in charge of the Internet,you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.Hang left at cranky, right at preoccupied,U-turn on silent treatment,all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'.You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection.Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan,but I still stretch miles in all directions.If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.comwould be one big website.That way you could listen to cool musicwhile you pretend to look for a joband you're really just chattin' with your pals.(Laughter)Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people.(Laughter)They would not email you back(Laughter) --but you'd get an automated reply.(Laughter)Their name in your inbox(Laughter) --it's all you wanted anyway.And a message saying, "Hey, it's me. I miss you.(Laughter)Listen, you'll see being dead is dandy.Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy."If I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loopof a boy in an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword,trashcan lid for a shield, shouting, "I am the emperor of oranges.I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges."Now follow me, OK?(Laughter)Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions.One, two, three.That links with hotdiggitydog.com.That is my grandfather.They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.He forms an attachment tokind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom,who downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges,who grows up to be me --the guy who usually goes too far.So if I were emperor of the Internet,I guess I'd still be mortal, huh?But at that point, I would probablyalready have the lowest possible mortgageand the most enlarged possible penis(Laughter) --so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office.I wouldn't need it.I'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me,I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that --pop! -- I'd go wireless.(Laughter)Huh? Maybe Google would hire this.I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virusuntil the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organizedas I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee,you want to bet just how whack and un-PCyour Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rockinghot-shit-hot-shot-god.net?I guess it's just like life.It is not a question of if you can --it's: do ya?We can interfere with the interface.We can make "You've got Hallelujah" the national anthem of cyberspaceevery lucky time we log on.You don't say a prayer.You don't write a psalm.You don't chant an "om."You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking ofat dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.Thank you, TED.(Applause)

bono_s_call_to_action_for_africa

Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously saidon his first successful telephone call,"Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?"(Laughter)I just really want to thank you very much.As another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said,"What a strange, long trip."And he should have said,"What a strange, long trip it's about to become."At this very moment, you are viewing my upper half.My lower half is appearing at a different conference(Laughter)in a different country.You can, it turns out, be in two places at once.But still, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person.I'll explain at another time.And though I'm a rock star,I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub.But what really turns me on about technologyis not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players.The revolution -- this revolution -- is much bigger than that.I hope, I believe.What turns me on about the digital age,what excites me personally,is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song,you needed a studio and a producer.Now, you need a laptop.If you wanted to make a film, you needed a mass of equipmentand a Hollywood budget.Now, you need a camera that fits in your palm,and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints.And that really, really excites me.I'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints.Political, economic, psychological, whatever.The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world.From the ease with which you swept away obstaclesthat no one knew could even be budged.And that's actually what I'd like to talk about today.First, though, I should probably explain why, and how,I got to this place.It's a journey that started 20 years ago.You may remember that song, "We Are the World,"or, "Do They Know It's Christmas?"Band Aid, Live Aid.Another very tall, grizzled rock star, my friend Sir Bob Geldof,issued a challenge to "feed the world."It was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.That summer, my wife, Ali, and myself went to Ethiopia.We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.We lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.The children had a name for me.They called me, "The girl with the beard."(Laughter)Don't ask.Anyway, we found Africa to be a magical place.Big skies, big hearts, big, shining continent.Beautiful, royal people.Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back.Ethiopia didn't just blow my mind; it opened my mind.Anyway, on our last day at this orphanagea man handed me his baby and said,"Would you take my son with you?"He knew, in Ireland, that his son would live,and that in Ethiopia, his son would die.It was the middle of that awful famine.Well, I turned him down.And it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down.And it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget.And in that moment, I started this journey.In that moment, I became the worst thing of all:I became a rock star with a cause. (Laughter)Except this isn't the cause, is it?Six-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS --a preventable, treatable disease --for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy.That's not a cause. That's an emergency.11 million AIDS orphans in Africa,20 million by the end of the decade.That's not a cause. That's an emergency.Today, every day, 9,000 more Africanswill catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education.That's not a cause. That's an emergency.So what we're talking about here is human rights.The right to live like a human.The right to live, period.And what we're facing in Africa isan unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality.The next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is,and what this problem isn't.Because this is not all about charity.This is about justice. Really.This is not about charity. This is about justice.That's right.And that's too bad, because we're very good at charity.Americans, like Irish people, are good at it.Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford.We like to give, and we give a lot.Look at the response to the tsunami -- it's inspiring.But justice is a tougher standard than charity.You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice.It makes a farce of our idea of equality.It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern.It questions our commitment.Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa,and if we're honest,conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.As you heard in the film, anywhere else, not here.Not here, not in America, not in Europe.In fact, a head of state that you're all familiar withadmitted this to me. And it's really true.There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human lifewould be accepted anywhere else other than Africa.Africa is a continent in flames.And deep down, if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us,we would all do more to put the fire out.We're standing around with watering cans,when what we really need is the fire brigade.You see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami.It's crazy, really, when you think about it.Does stuff have to look like an action movie these daysto exist in the front of our brain?The slow extinguishing of countless livesis just not dramatic enough, it would appear.Catastrophes that we can avertare not as interesting as ones we could avert.Funny, that.Anyway, I believe that that kind of thinkingoffends the intellectual rigor in this room.Six-and-a-half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis,but the fact that it's not on the nightly news,that we in Europe, or you in America,are not treating it like an emergency --I want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis.I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror,it could be soon.Every week, religious extremists take another African village.They're attempting to bring order to chaos.Well, why aren't we?Poverty breeds despair. We know this.Despair breeds violence. We know this.In turbulent times, isn't it cheaper, and smarter,to make friends out of potential enemiesthan to defend yourself against them later?"The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty."And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that.Now when the military are telling us that this is a warthat cannot be won by military might alone,maybe we should listen.There's an opportunity here, and it's real.It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking.The problems facing the developing worldafford us in the developed worlda chance to re-describe ourselves to the world.We will not only transform other people's lives,but we will also transform the way those other lives see us.And that might be smart in these nervous, dangerous times.Don't you think that on a purely commercial level,that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisementsfor Western ingenuity and technology?Doesn't compassion look well on us?And let's cut the crap for a second.In certain quarters of the world, brand EU, brand USA,is not at its shiniest.The neon sign is fizzing and cracking.Someone's put a brick through the window.The regional branch managers are getting nervous.Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized.Our values: do we have any?Our credibility?These things are under attack around the world.Brand USA could use some polishing.And I say that as a fan, you know?As a person who buys the products.But think about it.More anti-retrovirals make sense.But that's just the easy part, or ought to be.But equality for Africa --that's a big, expensive idea.You see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference.What on earth can we all do about this?Well, much more than we think.We can't fix every problem, but the ones we can,I want to argue, we must.And because we can, we must.This is the straight truth, the righteous truth.It is not a theory.The fact is that ours is the first generationthat can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye,look across the ocean to Africa, and say this, and mean it:we do not have to stand for this.A whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this.(Applause)And let me say this without a trace of irony --before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies.Forget the '60s. We can change the world.I can't; you can't, as individuals; but we can change the world.I really believe that, the people in this room.Look at the Gates Foundation.They've done incredible stuff, unbelievable stuff.But working together, we can actually change the world.We can turn the inevitable outcomes,and transform the quality of life for millions of liveswho look and feel rather like us, when you're up close.I'm sorry to laugh here, but you do look so differentthan you did in Haight-Ashbury in the '60s.(Laughter)But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for.It is the flowering of the seeds you plantedin earlier, headier days.Ideas that you gestated in your youth.This is what excites me.This room was born for this moment,is really what I want to say to you tonight.Most of you started out wanting to change the world, didn't you?Most of you did, the digital world.Well, now, actually because of you,it is possible to change the physical world.It's a fact.Economists confirm it, and they know much more than I do.So why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air?Probably because when we admit we can do something about it,we've got to do something about it.It is a pain in the arse.This equality business is actually a pain in the arse.But for the first time in history, we have the technology;we have the know-how; we have the cash;we have the life-saving drugs.Do we have the will?I hope this is obvious, but I'm not a hippie.And I'm not really one for the warm, fuzzy feeling.I do not have flowers in my hair.Actually, I come from punk rock.The Clash wore big army boots, not sandals.But I know toughness when I see it.And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast,there was muscle to the movement that started out here.You see, idealism detached from action is just a dream.But idealism allied with pragmatism,with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit,is very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong.And it's very present in a crowd like you.Last year at DATA, this organization I helped set up,we launched a campaign to summon this spiritin the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty.We're calling it the ONE Campaign.It's based on our belief that the action of one personcan change a lot,but the actions of many coming together as onecan change the world.Well, we feel that now is the time to prove we're right.There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself.We believe this is one.We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decidesthat the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable.This could be the time that we finally get seriousabout changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth.Momentum has been building.Lurching a little, but it's building.This year is a test for us all,especially the leaders of the G8 nations,who really are on the line here,with all the world in history watching.I have been, of late, disappointed with the Bush Administration.They started out with such promise on Africa.They made some really great promises,and actually have fulfilled a lot of them.But some of them they haven't.They don't feel the push from the ground, is the truth.But my disappointment has much more perspectivewhen I talk to American people,and I hear their worries about the deficit,and the fiscal well being of their country.I understand that.But there's much more push from the ground than you'd think,if we got organized.What I try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree,is that aid for Africa is just great value for moneyat a time when America really needs it.Putting it in the crassest possible terms,the investment reaps huge returns.Not only in lives saved, but in goodwill, stabilityand security that we'll gain.So this is what I hope that you will do, if I could be so bold,and not have it deducted from my number of wishes.(Laughter)What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts,that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa,by America and by the world.Give them permission, if you like,to spend their political capital and your financial capital,your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people.That's really what I would like you to do.Because we also need your intellectual capital:your ideas, your skills, your ingenuity.And you, at this conference, are in a unique position.Some of the technologies we've been talking about, you invented them,or at least revolutionized the way that they're used.Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital,and pushed the boundaries.And we'd like you to give us that energy.Give us that kind of dreaming, that kind of doing.As I say, there're two things on the line here.There's the continent Africa.But there's also our sense of ourselves.People are starting to figure this out.Movements are springing up.Artists, politicians, pop stars, priests, CEOs,NGOs, mothers' unions, student unions.A lot of people are getting together, and workingunder this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign.I think they just have one idea in their mind,which is, where you live in the worldshould not determine whether you live in the world.(Applause)History, like God, is watching what we do.When the history books get written,I think our age will be remembered for three things.Really, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for.The digital revolution, yes.The war against terror, yes.And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa.Some say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to.Thank you, thank you very much.(Applause)Okay, my three wishes.The ones that TED has offered to grant.You see, if this is true, and I believe it is,that the digital world you all created has uncoupledthe creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter,this should be a piece of piss.(Laughter)I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes.Most of them impossible, some of them impracticaland one or two of them certainly immoral.(Laughter)This business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean,when somebody else is picking up the tab.Anyway, here's number one.I wish for you to help build a social movementof more than one million American activists for Africa.That is my first wish.I believe it's possible.A few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up.You know, there's lots out there.And with this one campaign as our umbrella,my organization, DATA, and other groups,have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasmthat's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America.We know there's more than enough energy to power this movement.We just need your help in making it happen.We want all of you here, church America, corporate America,Microsoft America, Apple America, Coke America,Pepsi America, nerd America, noisy America.We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.I do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong,we're not going to be denied.We will have the ear of Congress.We'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book,and right into the Oval Office.If there's one million Americans -- and I really know this --who are ready to make phone calls,who are ready to be on email,I am absolutely sure that we can actually changethe course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa.Anyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up.I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this,but there's lots of you we'd like to talk to.Right, my second wish, number two.I would like one media hit for every person on the planetwho is living on less than one dollar a day.That's one billion media hits.Could be on Google, could be on AOL.Steve Case, Larry, Sergey -- they've done a lot already.It could be NBC. It could be ABC.Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars.We have a film, produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media.But you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas.We need to get the math; we need to get the statistics out to the American people.I really believe that old Truman line,that if you give the American people the facts,they'll do the right thing.And, the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers.This has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.(Video): One by one they step forward,a nurse, a teacher, a homemaker,and lives are saved.The problem is enormous.Every three seconds one person dies.Another three seconds, one more.The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa,Asia, even America,that aid groups, just as they did for the tsunami,are uniting as one, acting as one.We can beat extreme poverty, starvation, AIDS.But we need your help.One more person, letter, voicewill mean the difference between life and deathfor millions of people.Please join us by working together.Americans have an unprecedented opportunity.We can make history.We can start to make poverty history.One, by one, by one.Please visit ONE at this address.We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice.Bono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information,its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives,by connecting every hospital, health clinic and schoolin one African country.And I would like it to be Ethiopia.I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia,every health clinic, every hospital --we can connect to the Internet.That is my wish, my third wish.I think it's possible.I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.And that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true.I've been to Ethiopia, as I said earlier.It's actually where it all started for me.The idea that the Internet, which changed all of our lives,can transform a country -- and a continentthat has hardly made it to analog, let alone digital -- blows my mind.But it didn't start out that way.The first long-distance line from Boston to New Yorkwas used in 1885 on the phone.It was just nine years later that Addis Ababawas connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away.Since then, not that much has changed.The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopiais actually about seven or eight years.But wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then.Anyway, I'm Irish, and as you can see,I know how important talking is.Communication is very important for Ethiopia -- will transform the country.Nurses getting better training,pharmacists being able to order supplies,doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine.It's a very, very good idea to get them wired.And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference.Thank you very much once again.(Applause)

I bet you're worried.(Laughter)I was worried.That's why I began this piece.I was worried about vaginas.I was worried what we think about vaginasI was worried about my own vagina.(Laughter)she told me she didn't have time.(Laughter)full-length preferred.She was busy; she didn't have time.They began as casual vagina interviews,and they turned into vagina monologues.I talked with over 200 women.I talked to older women, younger women,married women, lesbians, single women.(Laughter)It sounds like an infection, at best.Maybe a medical instrument."Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!"(Laughter)Vagina, vagina, vagina."Darling, would you stroke my vagina,"you kill the act right there.(Laughter)You need to air out your Pussycat."(Laughter)In Westchester, they call it a Pooki,in New Jersey, a twat.(Laughter)Cooter, Labbe, Gladys Seagelman, VA,Wee wee, Horsespot, Nappy Dugout,a Split Knish in Philadelphia ...(Laughter)and a Schmende in the Bronx.(Laughter)I am worried about vaginas.But it really didn't begin there.It began with a conversation with a woman.and we got onto the subject of her vagina,and I was kind of shocked.So I said to a friend casually,because they had an amazing story,and I was sucked down the vagina trail.(Laughter)And I really haven't gotten off of it.(Laughter)that began eight years ago.I didn't really believe in happiness.and live in this world of pain?"like numbness or decadence or selfishness.a little bit more about happiness.and talking about it, and stating it.I often have the experience of whiplashor the potential of my neck breaking.But if I go with the wave,and that led to another woman.And then I wrote those stories down,because it felt too daunting.but doesn't intervene on their behalf.What could we do with this informationthat all these women are being violated?"will be beaten or raped in her lifetime.That's essentially a gender;to Glenn Close, to Whoopi Goldberg --and we did one performance on one evening,and that catalyzed this wave, this energy.And within five years,this extraordinary thing began to happen.this energy, to college campuses,"and so she took the play and she said,And over the course of the last six years,What I have learned is two things:because it's become ordinary.This journey has taken me to Afghanistan,from being educated, to being employed,For those of you who don't know,for being caught eating vanilla ice cream.where bones of women have washed upand been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles.where girls are date-raped and drugged.is the antidote to depression,Because before the "Vagina Monologues,"and it's been an extraordinary thing --I have met a new species.on this particular panel,that it's beneath, beyond and between,(Laughter)are what gets the ratings on TV shows.But every single country I have been to --or a machete,they hold the violence in their bodies;and I want to tell a few stories,where it goes into our bodies.is that I live in my body a lot,And this is a very heady place.(Laughter)that that separation has created a divideAnd the connection between body and headoften brings those things into union.of this whole principle and species,and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez.And she couldn't get out,and she had no money.and she could bring her sister.And at that time,And she came, and she witnessed this,She was 21 years old.I left and you can, too."She gave up her life; she moved to Juarez.She began to document it.We were there a week ago,And as we walked through the streets,because the streets are so dangerous,literally stood there and wept,for that particular community.There's another woman, named Agnes.I met her three years ago in Kenya.And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl;and she really made a decisionAnd she walked through the Rift Valley,And in the course of her travel --because the Maasai are nomads,and she would find them again --she saved 1,500 girls from being cut.When we met her three years ago,we said, "What could V-Day do for you?"(Laughter)So we bought her a jeep.and they could be saved."and it had all the trappings and the looksand, in fact, my life was hell.I lived with an alcoholic fatherNow, Mr. Alligator never did come,and made it OK for me to keep going,because I believed, in the distance,Cut to 40-some odd years later,we go to Kenya, and we're walking,we arrive at the opening of this house.I want to tell you a great story.When Agnes first started fightingAnd in the Maasai community,and she said to me,Anyway, we arrived, and when we arrived,and they greeted us.and they walked us down the path.It was a gorgeous day in the African sun,And he had shown up, obviously,we heal the broken part inside each of us.And I feel, in the last eight years,has taught me this really simple thing,which is that happiness exists in action;And I feel that knowledge and that journeyhas been an extraordinary privilege,and I feel really blessedThank you very much.(Applause)

Over the past couple of days,as I've been preparing for my speech,And --(Laughter)So I was getting pretty nervousand that's more nerve-racking.and my great-grandfather,and I realized(Laughter)that I had to consider this "my element."So, who am I?We have about 125 people internationally.If you looked in the book,you saw this ...(Laughter)which I really was appalled by.(Laughter)I made a graph that moves,and I talk about the makeup of me.(Laughter)So, besides this freakish thing,this is my science slide.(Laughter)So --where a blogger talked about how you hackand it spread all over.Kryptonite had to adjust the lock,You may have heard about Rathergate,which was basically the result of bloggersrealizing that the "th" in 111is not typeset on an old typewriter;it's on Word.Bloggers exposed this,or they worked hard to expose this.These people are reaching thousands,if not millions, of readers,and that's incredibly important.During the hurricane,updating it frequently.You have my friend,He makes enough money just by running ads,to support his family up in Oregon.That's all he does now,It's a wonderful organizationThis is wonderful.I am not that caring.(Laughter)I talk about myself.That's what I am. I'm a blogger.and I am an expert on this person,and so I write about it.So, the short story about my blog:it started in 2001, I was 23.I wasn't happy with my job,because I was a designer,but I wasn't being really stimulated.I was an English major in college.So, I started to write a blogand basically by the end,jumped off Bible Peak.You can laugh, this is OK.(Laughter)This is me.This is what happened to me.And I set a goal.I said, "I'm going to win an award,"And then I wrote a post about a banjo.I wrote a postabout wanting to buy a banjo --a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.And I don't play instruments;I don't know anything about music.I like music, and I like banjos,and I said, "I could do that."And I said to my husband,And my husband --(Laughter)this is my husband, who is very hot --he won an award for being hot.(Laughter)He told me,"You cannot buy a banjo.this person is so loving and so sweetthat he lets me dress him upand post pictures of him to my blog.(Laughter)he would kill me.But the thing was, my friends read it,But I got emails from people that said,Why don't you open a separate account?"They said, "Separate your bank account.And then I got people saying, "Leave him."(Laughter)And why are they reading this?"And I started to kill my blog slowly.Slowly and slowly --and she passed away two years ago.and gossip and all these things.These are out there,and this is who I am."Norman Rockwell is not art.to us as humans.These things resonate with us,and then you have this.His father was a blogger.And he was writing his blog one day,and his wife gave birth to her babyat 25 weeks.And he never expected this.And this is a one-pound baby.So Odin was documented every single day.day 39 -- he gets pneumonia.His baby is so small,and I've never encountered such a --And you're reading this as it happens,breathing failures and heart failures,And you see this post.but this is something this person feels,but 28 people matter.And today, he is a healthy baby,who, if you read his blog --it's snowdeal.org, his father's blog --So, blogs.throughout our online history.and that's where we are today.But then you also find people's blogs,because blogging software is simple.it's not rocket science.So --And we started with a slide of my Teds,and I had to add this slide,This is my mom.So, I have all the people that I know of.in terms of my direct line.looking at constantly.so does that first generation up there."And it's just these little things.and how we can trace our line.So that has always influenced me.I have this record, this 1910 census,if they spoke English,And it's pretty sad,that's why my husband's a saint --I spent time in the Washington archives,Now it's online, but he sat through that.And so you have this record and --This is my great-great-grandmother.This is the only picture I have.this is an amazing thing.or a series of photos, is this projectTwenty-nine years.You see all this math?because that's my skill set.(Laughter)So you have these people aging,and now this is them today, or last year.if I ever have children --what I am going to --who I was.I am a blogger --that is an amazing thing for me,every single day.And, you know, it's the same picture;it's basically the same person.Only a couple of people read it.I don't write this for this audience;About four people probably read it,and they tell me, "You haven't updated."and say, what was I doing this day?I look at it, I know exactly.I put the bad pictures up too,because there are bad pictures.(Laughter)I had to go for a one-day trip.I was sick, and I was in a hotel room,and I wanted not to be there.and it's a pretty disturbing thing,in all of what I'm doing.So, this woman, her name was Emma,you know, there was 100 people.we could keep track of everyone.And she was writing one day,and then she disappeared for a little bit.and it was a very hard day at the company.and flattening this sort of world.That this woman is in England,and she lives -- she lived -- a lifeher sister wrote to me, and she said --and she wrote on this blog --And that was amazing,That was an amazing thing.And that's a huge thing.So, this is her legacy,think about what you've thought of them,and then actually do it,So, thank you.(Applause)

I can't help but this wish:what would it be?"And I always answered,"Well, I'd want the wishWell, then you'd be screwed,I'm not going to wish for that.And I know what you're thinking:You're thinking, "The poor girl up there,she thinks she's at a beauty pageant.She's not. She's at the TED Prize."(Laughter)But I really do think it makes sense.is for people to meet each other.and I've filmed some of them,to a military press officer in Qatar,who would rather not take over the world.you'd understand a little bit why.(Applause)Thank you.is a way for people to travel,to meet people in a different way than --my mom had an exchange student.This is Donna.This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty.This is Donna eating ice cream.it becomes more and more importantthat we learn each other's dance moves,what makes them laugh and cry.and I can't force everybody to travel;You can't force people, free will.because of where I come from.I'm the daughter of an American motherand an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.No pun intended.(Laughter)And I've also been called,the "Middle East Peace Crisis."It all kind of started that way,in Egypt, when I was about 16.My mother took me there.There was a center there,you can get from sorting through garbage.And I began teaching there.barely can afford their evening meal,and just incredible qualities.things that they wanted memories of.asked me to show them at the conference.So I was 18; I was very excited.People were very upset,And as I sat there, I got very depressed.and I was like, "I failed at this."in such difficult circumstances.And I think it was at that pointbring people together, cross borders.and I've done a couple of music films.it was a very surreal feeling for me,because before the war started,And I was watching television in New York,to embedded troops.And what was coming across on the newsSo I knew that I had to go there.I just wanted to be in the center.I had no plan. I had no funding.George Bush's favorite channel,by many governments across the Arab world,by some people in the US government.has to be doing something right.I've got to go see what this is all about.which was 10 minutes away.on the Arab side, reaching the Arab world,And when I went there and sat there,and sat with these characters,of when you sit with somebodyand you film them, and you listen to them,The amazing complexity of people emerges.Samir Khader: Business as usual.Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.I still have that dream.Maybe I will never be able to do it,but I have plans for my children.When they finish high school,I will pay for their study.And they will stay there.Al Jazeera showed them --a cold tile floor.And it was revolting.It was absolutely revolting.It made me sick at my stomach.and thought to myself, "Wow, that's gross.That's bad."And it didn't affect me as much.So, the impact that had on me --and those people in the Al Jazeera officeand it upset me on a profound levelIt makes me hate war.that can live without war yet.We had no funding for it.And when we showed the filmwe had such incredible reactions.In the Arab world --who was thinking about things.people wanted to meet Josh.Al Jazeera offered him a job.(Laughter)And Samir, on the other hand,that the Arab world has with the West.when they'd see this film.You know, we're criticized abroadbut the flip side of it is that, actually,we feel this power, that we need to --And I saw this with audiences."You know, I know this is crazy.I saw the military going out to war,and how do we get out of this bubble?But I know the power of it,Now, I'm not a philosopher,being taken into another world.that we're faced with today.[Paradise Now][Man: Then let us be equal in death.][We still have Paradise.][Man: God forbid!][May God forgive you.][If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...][In this life, we're dead anyway.][Will we win that way?][Man: So with no alibi, Israel will stop?][Man: How, if Israel has no morals?][Woman: Be careful!][Encounter Point][We have no information.][Are you sure she is dead?"][They said yes.][George: On that day, at around 6:30][When we got to here ...][When we passed by the first jeep ...][they opened fire on us.][And my 12-year-old daughter Christine][was killed in the shooting.][Bereaved Families Forum, Jerusalem][Tzvika: Yes, I have assistants.][I deal with children all the time.][But after thinking logically about it, ][and let them know of our suffering.][and look forward to a better future,][then everyone else must do so, too.][Amandla](Music)they would still not understand.But I tell you, when you finish that song,I know where you guys are coming from.Death unto apartheid!"and demanded freedom.Yes. Yes!(Music and singing)(Singing) Freedom!(Applause)And what I'd like to talk about ishow can we use that feelingand Robert Wright said yesterdayAnd that's what this is about.It's about connecting people through film,and taking a job with Al Jazeera.(Laughter)to bridge the gap between East and West.And that's an amazing thing.But I've been trying to think about waysto give power to these independent voices,to give power to the filmmakers,And there are incredible organizationsthat are out there doing this already.to be able to put their --(Applause)Yeah, it's amazing.I've watched it and I'm blown away by itto create some momentum,I'd like for us to imagine for a second.all from around the world,getting together, and sitting in the dark,or a couple of films, together.makes a joke, sings a song.Comedies, documentaries, shorts.to Tahrir Square in Cairo,about using the side of the Great Pyramidand the Great Wall of China.It's endless what you can imagine,in terms of where you can project filmsof the world to get out there,that the biggest challenge in our futureis understanding the other,And if film can do that,to watch these films together --this could be an incredible day.So we've already made a partnership,from the Jacob Burns Film Center.And we started calling up everybody.And in the last week,and independent films to get out there.and I'd like to share this with you.has been sharing ideas and wishes,how does this day echo into the future?so that we can build communityThere was a time, many, many years ago,And we call that landmass Pangea.And if you just imaginebut the only way that I know how to do it,that can really make this happen.And that's my wish.but we're way out of time.the power of film.CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Jehane Noujaim.

(Laughter)I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends --Not just by learning principles,Often that's what people think I do,and it's the furthest thing from it.What happens, though, is people say to me,"I don't need any motivation."But that's not what I do.I'm the "why" guy.I want to know why you do what you do.What is your motive for action?Are you running the same pattern?is the most important thing.All of us here have great minds.Most of us here have great minds, right?We all know how to think.We can make anything happen.that people work in their self-interest.But we know that that's bullshit at times.because when emotion comes into it,What I would like to invite you to doOne: so that you can contribute more.because it's making us intersect.of "everybody now understands everybody,and everybody appreciates everybody."What in their performance?"I got hired to produce the result now.I've done it for 30 years.I get the phone calland they were ahead by five strokesand now they can't get back on the course.I've got to do something.How do you make a change?to do something beyond themselves.Maybe the real question is,How do you make your dreams happen?whatever, your body, your family.Because science is easy, right?You can only feel so much by yourself.how somebody's life changesLike all the resources they say they need.end up the rest of their lifegoing in and out of rehab.and not always, but often,What is it that shapes us?We live in a therapy culture.the mindset that we are our past.The past equals the future.Of course it does if you live there.and then not use it, not apply it.When you ask people,Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.What do they tell you?I didn't have the right manager.(Laughter)(Applause) (Cheering)(Applause continues)TR: And --(Applause)(Laughter)but that is not the defining factor.(Applause) (Laughter)And you correct me if I'm wrong.is if you have emotion, human emotion,Audience: Yeah!(Applause) (Cheering)(Laughter)Idiot, Robbins.to get this man's intellect and capacity.and I was upset.But there was emotion there.Do you know what I'm talking about?Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.TR: So, emotion is it.If you're creative, playful, fun enough,can you get through to anybody, yes or no?If you don't have the money,This is the ultimate resource.They tell us a bunch of different stories.if you take a look here,(Laughter)(Laughter)What determines your resources?What will you focus on?Consciously or unconsciously.and that meaning produces emotion.Is this the end or the beginning?So, think about your own life,have there been some decisionsAudience: Aye.I know the Google geniuses I saw here --Or someone standing in front of a tank."You've got testicular cancer."(Laughter)It wasn't the end; it was the beginning.of the three million I've been around.So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?We all have had times,(Laughter)It wasn't your ability; it was your state.It makes people make decisions.It's made up of three parts.It's not your desires.You can get your desires or goals.Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.then you find out what's your map,and at least be comfortable.Now, how do you get it?even though we need that --you won't listen to any speaker.What do you feel if you're certain?what would you feel?We need variety. We need surprise.Audience: Aye.So, variety is important.Who's done this? Get a fucking life.(Laughter)Why are you doing it?and there's variety.Third human need, critical: significance.Whatever it takes.The fastest way to do this,or resourcefulness, is violence.Zero to 10. How high? 10.How much uncertainty?all the way down there.Total variety and uncertainty.You can get significance a million ways,We all want it;And you're going to get hurt again.Here's what's true: we need it.through walking in nature.when you come back 5 minutes later.The last two are the needs of the spirit.And this is where fulfillment comes.You won't get it from the first four.But number five, you must grow.We all know the answer.If you don't grow, you're what?if you're not growing,how many love you,you feel like hell.And I believe the reason we growis so we have something to give of value.Because we all know, corny as that sounds,the secret to living is giving.It's exciting.the most exciting thing is:And that calling can touch other people.Thanksgiving, no money, no food,we were not going to starve,but my father was totally messed up,His focus was "This is charity.What does it mean? I'm worthless.(Laughter)And now somebody I don't know,looking out for us.And that made me decide,Next year, I did four, then eight.So I went out, got my friends involved,18 years later,through our foundation.in different countries around the world.(Applause)Thank you.because they get excited to contributeSo, finally -- I'm about out of time.The target that shapes you --Here's what's different about people.We have the same needs.or uncertainty?Are you driven by significance or love?We all need all six,The second piece is the map.and some people's map is,and they're a fireman,But they have a different map.The last piece is emotion.One of the parts of the map is like time.If you've got a target and a map --I can't use Google because I love Macs,So if you use MapQuest --(Laughter)The last thing is emotion.Here's what I'll tell you about emotion.There are 6,000 emotionsBut if your dominant emotions --If I have 20,000 people or 1,000in an average week,and I give them as long as they need,the other's disempowering,They have six good feelings.Happy, happy, excited, oh shit,How many of you know somebody(Laughter)How many of you know somebody like this?I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,and at the end, I stopped.And all of a sudden, I said,And I went through this whole thingThat night is when 9/11 happened.She said, "It's over."It was stupid of me."because I'm going to die."She was on Larry King later.And he said, "You're probably wonderingDon't let anything ever stop you.""I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.but frankly, this is retribution."(Laughter)Are you sure?(Laughter)10 seconds!(Laughter and applause)10 seconds, I want to be respectful.All I can tell you is,I brought this man on stagebecause I had about 200 New Yorkers there.marking off their Palm Pilots.30 friends crossing off that all died.And I got the group to focus on:if you didn't lose somebody today,doesn't know anybody here.I asked, "Do you always get angry?"She said, "Yes."and this man who wanted to be a terrorist,and I made it very clear.instead of my verbalization,but the two of them not only came togetherthrough various mosques and synagogues,the idea of how to create peace.So, transformation can happen.My invitation to you is:explore your web,the web in here --for two reasons:but I mean give,And secondly, so you can appreciate --(Applause)

Hello voice mail, my old friend.(Laughter)I've called for tech support again.I ignored my boss's warning.I called on a Monday morning.I'm still on hold.I'm listening to the sounds of silence.I don't think you understand.I think your phone lines are unmanned.I punched every touch tone I was told,but I've still spent 18 hours on hold.and it constantly hangs and bombs --it erased my ROMs!Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence.In my dreams I fantasizeof wreaking vengeance on you guys.Say your motorcycle crashes.Blood comes gushing from your gashes.But you get me.(Laughter)And you listen to the sounds of silence.(Music)(Applause)Thank you.Good evening and welcome to:(Laughter)the deal was like this:Every week, it'll arrive at your door.and you'll get paid for it.You can think about it, if you want.If you ever are feeling lonely,get a New York Times column,People are feeling like things --Lucky you can't see it.People are feeling overwhelmed.It may be good technology,There's not enough help.to make it easy and enjoyable to use.from users saying,""Me too, and here's my tale of woe."I call it "software rage."And man, let me tell you,(Laughter)Ok, so why is the problem accelerating?And part of the problem is, ironically,into making things easier to use.I'll show you what I mean.Over the years, it's gotten easier to use.This is the original Mac operating system.And the entire operating system --(Laughter)with this equipment for the first time.for a day.Uh-uh.Your call may be recordedand pass them around on a CD.(Laughter)Which they do.(Laughter)And I have a copy.(Laughter)It's in your gift bag. No, no.With your voices on it!Making a squeaking noise.And the technician said,the faster I move it across the screen."(Laughter)And the technician's like,(Laughter)(Laughter)So, we must admitBut why is the technical overload crisis,the complexity crisis, accelerating now?When you buy a piece of software,and every year, they say,from just these software upgrades.I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox --you eventually ruin it.the Eisenhower administration.(Laughter)But what's the alternative?Microsoft actually did this experiment.They said, "Well, wait a minute.It tanked. No one ever bought it.I call this the Sport Utility Principle.you wind up with this.(Laughter)un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word,(Laughter)you have to do two dimensions, you know:a vertical and a horizontal.You guys all complainand underlining your links automatically.The off switch is in there somewhere.I'm telling you -- it's there.There are only four choices,so why are they in a pop-up menu?that you need to collapse the choices.They could have put them all out in view.(Applause)There are these "wizards" everywhere.where they might wind up.[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard](Laughter)(Applause)"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard."Ok, I'll bite.Let's click "Next" to continue.(Laughter)(Applause)(Laughter)So what is the answer?I believe in consistency, when possible,real-world equivalents,But I beg of the designers herewhich is intelligence.Now what do I mean by that?I'm going to give you some examplesIf you are buying something on the web,you're supposed to put in your address,There are 200 countries in the world.I'm sorry; it's not one yet.So why is "United States" in the "U"s?(Laughter)but it would be intelligent.This one's been touched on before,by clicking a button called "Start?"(Laughter)in page order, on that printer.It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.(Laughter)(Laughter)(Applause)the cult of simplicity.So I'm the tap counter."So, I'm going to show you an example(Laughter)This is Microsoft Word.it could happen.(Laughter)Now, what happens when you choose "New?"Do you get a new blank document?You do not.Yes, I do.(Laughter)(Applause)The Bill Gates song!(Piano music)I've been a geek foreverand I wrote the very first DOS.I put my software and IBM together;I got profit and they got the loss.(Laughter)I'm getting royalties from everyone.You buy the box; I'll sell the code.Even Windows is a hack.We're kind of based loosely on the Mac.I'm not doing this for praise.Big mediocrity in every way.We've entered planet domination mode.You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.I am Bill Gates and I write the code.(Applause)locks into the old 1982 chassis.But there's also a new Microsoft,I liked the Media Center PC.I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.But let's put it this way:would you pay $10 a month to have a watch(Laughter)So, the signs might indicateSo is there any hope?putting manuals in the boxes,things are coming out at a faster pace.and he sort of did this.I'm like, where have I seen this before?I had just seen the movie "Evita" --(Laughter)with Madonna,and I'm like, you know what?I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.(Music)(Laughter)When I try to explain why I'm back,You won't believe me.with only a buddy named Woz.(Laughter)You try rhyming with garage!(Laughter)Don't cry for me, Cupertino.(Laughter)The truth is, I never left you.I made a fortune over at Pixar.(Laughter)Don't cry for me, Cupertino.I've still got the drive and vision.I still wear sandals in any weather.It's just that these days,they're Gucci leather.(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you.And the truth is,for years I was a little depressed,Windows had 95 percent market share --So I was a little depressed.And then I heard Al Gore's talk,(Laughter)But it turns out I was wrong, right?Because the iPod came out,not Apple's propriety standard.The lesson was: simplicity sells.The Sonos thing -- it's catching on.I've got just a couple examples.When you have a digital camera,Well, you either haul around a USB cable,Either one, you're going to lose.What I do is, I take out the memory card,put it right back in the camera.I never have to lose anything.Here's another example.or one of your children.I don't care. It's a loaner.Here we go. Whoa!(Applause)In my very last example --because the software is nervous.for doing emails very quickly; period.Correct "dissuade."Not "just."Ok, this is not an ideal situation,"Thanks for that."(Laughter)(Applause)which happens daily --I say, "Piss off."(Laughter)[I admire your frankness ...](Laughter)(Applause)(Laughter)This is version eight of this software,The company put no new features.95 percent accuracy was all they got,which means one in 20 words is wrong --and they'd put it in their drawer.And the company got sick of that,but make sure it's darned accurate."And so that's what they did.Easy is hard.Pre-sweat the details for your audience.Count the taps.it's deciding what to leave out.CA: Bravo.
